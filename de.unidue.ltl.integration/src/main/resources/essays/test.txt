1	The features of setting affects the cyclist because the setting then you won’t had, lots on hills. Also there was no water. For example, in the story He says in was were hilly area. Also he says that there are no buliding he is all by him self which @MONTH1 make him scared. So the setting affects the cyclist by being a very hot dry cimate with no water and no builiding; and no peole to ask for direcions would make him scared and lost and fearful of what is going to happen to him.
1	During the cyclist journey he was faced with many ?? ??. Mostly the driver ?? and out of water. In the essay it says how he arrived at the first town and was in search for water. It said &quot;This place might have been a thriving little spot at one time-say, before the last world war.&quot; This affected the cyclist because he was running out water. Another feature of the setting that affected the cyclist was the heatstrokes, and not a single car or building the whole way. 
1	The feature of the setting affected the cyclist because of the bad conditions of the road and the not sun and the desserts and the low amount of energy supply he had left the reasons why  
3	As if along bike ride through the city isn’t grueling enough, the author of this story had it much worse. First the climate was a recipe for a disaster. “High deserts of California in June.” @CAPS1 is clearly a debilitating factor as is direct sunlight and humidity. If the cyclist did not have the proper gean he could be hurt by all three of these factors. Secondly, “Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.” @CAPS2 his endurance is being tested because it is going for tolerance energy and will power to climb each individual hill. Most importantly, with his lack of water in his bottles, all of these characteristics were harmful. Within a desert, water is to be found nowhere. In hot weather, the water bottles will turn warm and in sunlight, water could even evaporate. To me, it seems like the setting and the weather were the perfect combination for doing much more harm than good.
1	The features that affect the cyclist is the lack of water he slows. Another is the directions from the old men that probably aren’t up to date nowadays.
1	The setting explains an early summer evening with some eccentric men. The mood that he would be in would probably be lively. “Like a foolish youth, the next morning I followed their advice…” (Kurmaskie) says that if you were very lively, I would take that as a way of being drunk without being drunk, and doing whatever someone thinks you should do without knowing you are being persuaded to do it.
2	The setting causes difficult problems for the cyclist and tough hazards. The weather is hot and just going through hot weather is tough enough, but giving through a desert with limited water had to be miserable. The warmth of the desert had an affect on the cyclist and caused him to be fatigue. This delayed him from getting to his destination quicker as well. Not only did he have to through tough weather but hazardous condition too. There were times when “tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake”. This delayed him and took time to cycle around. As you can see this was a difficult journey for the reader and the affected the cyclist.
11	Dear @LOCATION1, @CAPS1 you imagine where the world would be without computers? Our daily lives would be dull and boring without new technology. Computers help society do various activities that would be impossible if we didn't have computers. They give us the ability to learn at home, connect with other people, and give a source of entertainment. From these reasons our lives because easy and convenient, which is what @CAPS2 people strive to accomplish. The ability for an average person to learn has greatly increased. It has gone from just being able to go to school to the @CAPS2 various ways to increase your intelligence on the computer. Programs such as @ORGANIZATION1, which teaches people how to speak a language, are available on the computer. These programs are like going to school, but more accesible to the public. To further help the public, there are ways to gain college degrees online. that how . Even if you go to school a computer @CAPS1 still help you excel in you work @CAPS2 sources of research are available on the computer and you like to the web a computer is a great place for fun. However, people still think computers are good. They claim to gaining on the other hand, the computer gives people website to help lose weight.They also say people aren't enjoying nature, even though there are @CAPS2 ways to appreciate on the computer. Lastly, it is stated that you dont . To conclude, computers greatly benefit us and are good. New technology is good thing and should keep expanding because of gaining the ability to , conncet with people and having fun, a computer helps the general public. Please, think of what i have said and buy a computer!
3	The features surrounding the cyclist effect him greatly. All he has around him are hills, rough terraine, sand + tumble weeds. These features leave him thinking he will die because there is no life around him. Everything is dry + vivid + thats how it makes him feel. The old, rusty water pump shows that it hasn’t been used in ages + the black tar pumped out is no help to his negative thought of life.
1	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. Ranging from temperature, surroundings, and the availability of water. First of all, the cyclist felt tired and exhausted because of the temperature and terrain, For example, “I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June.” I can imagine the cruelty of the heat beating down on him while riding down the roads. It would make me tired and exhausted also. Second of all, the surroundings as he rode affected him and made him have less confidence as he rode further. For example, “This place might have been a thriving little spetatore time say, before the last world war-last on that morning it fit the traditional definition of a ghost town.” It shows how the information he had been giving caused him to feel unsure of where he was going. I’d feel uncapable and would do the same in his situation. Lastly, the lack of water made him scared. For example, “conserve my water and go instead for an hour or so a lest of my inner spirit.” It made him think the situation wasn’t good. So as one can see, it affected the cyclist in many ways.
3	In the essay “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” the author uses features of the setting to show the effects of the cyclist. In the essay the rider gets directions from two old men on a perch. In the essay it said, “Never accept braid advice from  a collection of old- timers who haven’t let be able centres of their porch since carter was in office. “This shows the old man could be wrong and places can change. Also, on this short cut he almost runs out of water. The essay ststed I would conserve my water and go inward for an hour or se – a test of my inner spirit. He is running out of water but has the determination to get to @CAPS1 last the terrain affects him. The Hills prove to be a challenge with a limited supply of water. The essay states. Flat roads were upleed by sheed, rolling hills. This shows he is extremely determined. Even though the hills added to the struggle he made it through. That is how the author used features of the setting to add to the struggle of the cyclist.
1	The features of the setting affected the cyclist because they figured that they were old enough and seen what was going on and been through that situation that they were well experienced and knew more about what was going on so the people should listen to them.
3	After the cyclist spoke to the “old timers who hadn’t left the confines of their porches since Carter was in office,” his confidence in them began to ware. He entered the desert happy, hopeful and determined. As his water reservoir began to disappear, and he approached the sight of the old shed, canal and a couple water pump, he began to feel touched. He made an attempt to get the water from the pumps and it was hot and “tested like battery acid”. As he rode on, his confidence only faded more. He travelled through the desert and “ridiculously large snake” and was running low on water. Finally he saw a building in the distance, which ironically enlights was an abandoned juice factory a sign featuring a left sipping on some succulent icy liquid teased ruin, and he began to lose hope. He didn’t think he would make it to his destination or anywhere else for that matter. Although after approaching the old factory, he came across a bait shop where his hope and energy was founded.
2	The features of the setting affets the cyclist in afew ways. For example, the features of the “Rough Road” didnt allow him to arive as fast so was drive @NUM1 on a @NUM2 speed limit. Second the fact that he was drivuing through a desert a large snake made its way on the Road, causing the man to have to &quot;ease past, trying to keep my balance in my dehidrated state.” @CAPS1 again because he was driving through the desert,hegot so hot &amp; started to get dehydrated of lack of water. Lastly the features that there werent any buildings far miles so he was left lost and didnt have anywhere to stop &amp; ask for directions. These few features defenitly affected the cyclist.
3	There were many features of the setting that affect he cyclist to make his difficut journey to Yosemite. First, it was the old timers at the reservoir campground. They might have been old, but not very wise. For example, “I followed their advice and launched out at first line, nd along a ‘short cut” that was toslice away hours from my ride to Yosemite National Park.” This is describing how the cyclist takes the short cut from the old timers which almost gets him killed @CAPS1, the sun had a warming affect on the cyclist causing him to dehydrate. For example, “I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularlyand I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June.” This is showing you an image of just how hot the climate he is in. Finally, a lack of water can cause major problems, such as heatstroke or dehydration, yoth which can lead to death. For example “I could drop from heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June…” This is stating without enough water to keep him cool he felt as if he were going to die.  
3	In the story “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” the setting often affects the character. One example of this is when the character got to a place where there was nothing. “One ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a corral that couldn’t hold in the lamest mule greeted me”. This quote explains that the character (cyclist) was confused. Another example of this harsh setting is when the water in his bottle feels @NUM1 degrees. “I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June.” That quote suggests that it is hot outside, which would make the water hot. Another example of the setting is when the terrain changed. &quot;@CAPS1 road was replaced by short, rolling hills.&quot; This made the biker have to work harder, and use more energy. These conditions all made the cyclist have to work harder to find his destination.
2	The setting in “Rough Road Ahead: Do not exceed posted speed limit,” affected the cyclist greatly. For starters it says he was “traveling through the high desserts” which is never a safe thing. He had been drinking he water regularly but the temperature was rising. He was, “trying to keep balance in my dehydrated state.” From lack of water because the terrain had altered his water into “A far like substance” The setting of the story was cruel to the cyclist.
2	The conditions and features affect everything about the cyclist. The conditions were that, he had to save as much water as possible and keep himself hydrated at the same time so that he wouldn’t dehydrate himself.The features of the desert like land were fierce. It was dry and bumpy, not to mention that there were creatures such as snakes on the prowl out there. You can never predict what they’ll do.
11	Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 the ages, technology has constantly been evolving and improving the way we think. From the first simple telephone in the @DATE1's to today's touch-screen iphone. From riding horses to riding extraordinary fast sports cars and hwlet trains. The advances in technology have proven the sky have the limit the invention of planes. We have even reached the moon and left our ! Computers have only become faster and. Although more and more people are using one of our greatest technological advances, computers, believe it doesnt benefit socialy. I veherrertly believe that computers benefit. They have the ability in and teach us what seems like information, second, they have made the could a smaller place through communication. Last, they even have the ability to locate missing people. Computers are constanly helping society. They follow what technology to make life @CAPS3. First of all, computers are a benefit to society because they have the ability to and teach teach us what seems like infinite information. Today, when soneone know/wants to some first place they usually that's light the. This is because engines such as @ORGANIZATION1 have of limits to with much information on the topic being. This has not only made leaving @CAPS3, but has also helped in studying for tests for elementary school. Computers also of for the average. From banking to powerpoint computer with all! For this reason even older such as @PERSON1 find computers weird. Second, computers benefit society becuase they the world smaller through communicates. Sixty years ago, it could relative on the. Today, you can easily video a rective in @LOCATION2 from @LOCATION1 in less that ten seconds. Not only can you talk to grandma or grandpa but you can even see them smile what children can even such as @CAPS4. When there is a they can still talk to warry of. Finally, computers benefit society have the ability to locate missing people. The record earthquale in @LOCATION3. cries of mothers children whom they from. It is to computers that these families were scuniled. On many sites on the internet, @LOCATION3 set up person locators. These locators allowed you to write down your name disaster should over happen. Not only this you family. All they had to do me! Computers have even made our society. What move could. In conclusion, I strongly believe that computers society is because computers contain much informations and programs they have proven the earth is a &quot;small world after all&quot; and they have made the world safer. It is that many people are buying computers, so why don't you get one?
1	The features of the setting in the story affect the cyclist in many ways. For example when he arrived to the first town the water had tasted like battery acid which made the rider concerve water another is with the harsh conditions such as the temperature. The ride would listen to the old people to try to get to the place he was going faster.
2	The features of the setting affect the cyclist greatly. One feature would be the dryness of the land. He was pedaling for such a long time that he became dehydrated, yet there was not a drop of water for he did not know how long and he didn’t think he could make it that far. Another feature of the setting was the heat. He felt like he could not go on because the heat from the sun made him want to have a heat stroke. Clearly, the features of the setting did greatly impact the cyclist.
3	During the cyclist’s trip, he experienced physical and mental strain. The intense heat, rough terrain, the animals and his isolation all contributed to his strain while completing his challenging task. His isolation while cycling down the “shortcut” was a definite factor in his strain. @PERSON1 stated that, “ there was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind.” All @PERSON1 had to focus on was accomplishing his task. There wasn’t anybody nearby to help him and there wasn’t any shelter for him to take to escape the heat. The heat itself played a very predominant factor in Kurmaskie’s physical strain. The heat caused him to become dangerously thirsty and required him to find an abundance of water fast. Kurmaskie stated, “ the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke” This statement proves that the intense temperature was a life threatening factor. The rough terrain and snake and two factors in his trip that just helped make his journey even more cruel. The physical strain of avoiding a snake in the middle of the road and the dangerous terrain just put him in a more grading position. 
2	In Joe Kurmaskie’s, “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” the features of the setting affect the cyclist in a bad way. First of all, the cyclist is dehydrated from the heat and lack of water. “I eased past, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state. &quot;This sentence from the text stores he is dehydrated, because of this it creates an obstacle he must face. Also, another bad affect from the features of the setting the cyclist is facing is, the rough road ahead he had to face. “ROUGH ROAD AHEAD: DO NOT EXcEED POSTED SPEED LIMIT.” If I were the cyclist gazing at the sign I would die just knowing there was trouble up ahead. Luckily the cyclist made his way through and managed his obstacles well.
1	There are many features in the setting that will affect the cyclists. One feature is the climate. When you are cycling and it is really hot you can dehydrate very fast. If it is really cold it is harder to breath and catch your breath. Another feature in the setting that can affect a cyclist is the terrain. If there are too many hills that are really steep than you will get very tired quickly and when it is rocky you have a posablity to fall off the bike and hurt yourself. Last feature in the setting that will affect a cyclist is how isolated the road is. If a cyclist runs out of water and there are no places to stop on the road, this could be almost deadly to a cyclist. Also if the road is so isolated and you get hurt who would find you. This is another deadly situation. These are the main features in the setting that can affect the cyclist.
2	The features at the setting affected the cyclist by dehydrating him. The setting had a hot sun, no trees, and no water. The cyclist was also feeling lesy. In the story he said “I and the growing ??? :??? That I could drop from heat stroke.”
0	The setting was hot and dry, which affected the cyclist greatly. She didn’t have enough space to carry a lot of water and rod to make portrons to drink. Also listening to old guys who didn’t know much didn’t help either and sent her on a much harder path to travel
1	The features of the setting affected the cyclist in a few ways. The first was the cool forested road that he set out on. Since the rote not easy, he felt confident and started end in the wrong direction. Another factor was when he rode into the desert. The cyclist was becoming dehydrated and whats little water he could find tasted like battery acid. These factors affected the cyclist by giving him false hope and nearly lead him to his death.
1	The way the setting of the story help the guy out alot. He was riding and it was hot but with “cool pines and risum river” it was worth the ride. It keep him cool so he could get his weter in the nex town. That is why I think that the pin and river were a big help.
2	Whether the lack of water, the hills, the tumble weeds – all are things that affect the cyclist. The lack of water affects the cyclist because it is hot outside and he needs water. The hills also affect him because it is hard to peddle up hills. Finally is the tumbleweeds. The tumble weeds show a distinct desert look. When he sees tumble weeds he try’s to keep balance because he is partially dehydrated and doesn’t want to crash. The dehydration / lack of water affect the author because he is very thirsty and everyone needs water to survive. When you are lack of water and energy it makes your goal more hard to complete.  
8	Dear local newspaper, I think that computers have a good effect on people. They are good because you can learn things educational. You can hear the latest stories on everything, and you can keep your information down for yourself. Computers are a good thing to have because you can learn information. @CAPS1 you have a question or don't know what something means, you can find out on the internet. These are some internet sources that are @NUM1 to answer questions. @CAPS1 we didnt have computers, then @CAPS1 you have a question, then you would have to go find a book to read in and that takes much more work. Another reason why computers are a good things is because you can catch up on all of the recent stories. You can learn about whats happenings in other parts of the world, you can learn things about celebrities, and you can look at the weather. You can find all this cut on television, but you never knows when it would come on. With computers, you can search all the latest stories and find things cut when you want to know them. With Computers, you can also keep information down. You could use @ORGANIZATION1 and keep everything you need to know in a nice and fashion. You can also make graphs on the computer. This way your graphs will nice have alright time and @CAPS1 you would to go information that in a @CAPS1 there were no computers then your information would not be as and you can it. I believe that computers are a good thing to have because you can hear about the latest stories, and you can keep your own information neat. I believe computers positive effect in people.
8	Dear Newspaper, i am writing you this letter, about computers, in the hope that you will publish it. Over @NUM1 the people in @LOCATION1 has a computer, but are they really healthy? I don't believe computers are a good thing. People spend to much time on them &amp; less time excirsing, enjoying nature &amp; most of all, it's highly dangerous. I don't believe computers are a good thing because people don't excersise like they did. Some people spend @NUM2 out of @NUM3 hours in a daw on computers for others it's there whole life. People spend so much time on computers they lose touch with the outside world. Ever since computers came out, obestity has gone up. all people do is chat to other people &amp; think &quot;they don't have to know what I look like.&quot;They sit at the computer eating &amp; eating. That's not healthy. I dont think computers are good also because they spend less time enjoying nature. It used to be when I had somoe free time, I could call up a friend &amp; ask them to take a walk with me somewhere &amp; they'd say &quot;sure! Now they say &quot;@CAPS1 get on the computers &amp; we can take a virtual walk.&quot; That's not the same as an actual walk with the wind in your face the fresh smell, &amp; all the animals, at least not to be. Nature is a thing of beauty &amp; if you don't enjoy appreciate it, it'll turn into something hideous. Nature used to be the most peaceful think now it the internet. I dont think computers are good because most importantly they're dangerous. Little kids, like myself, think they're grown up &amp; go on computers &amp; meet rapist, murderer, thiefs, all kids of criminals. Also people send hurtful &amp; violent things to each otehr &amp; it yo're on the computer alot of bad people can track you down. Also, the military &amp; @ORGANIZATION1 keeps secrets on computers but if your smart enough you can hack it. Computers aren't safe for anyone or anything. Well, I've told you my main @NUM4 reasons why I think computers aren't such great things, they're not healthy, emotionally or physically. People don't excirse they don't enjoy nature &amp; computers are highly dangerous. All I can do is hope you publish my letter so everyone can see my point of view &amp; make their own decisions. 
3	In “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” by Joe Kurmaskie, the features of the setting affect the cyclist by gradually wearing him out and pushing his limits of hope and survival skills. At first, the cyclist enters a deserted town but he remains calm and amused by this in the sentence, “I chuckled, check my water supply, and moved @NUM1). Soon after, the cyclist is troubled by a “ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, through the high deserts of California in June” (@NUM2). He is agitated by this, makes a significant dent in his water supply, and unfortunately continues. At the point where he is still isolated and lost beyond repair, the cyclist tries to stay hopeful but soon breaksdown. He reflects, “Telling myself that of I could make it that far, I’d be @NUM3). The features of the setting become more and more disappointed at each leg of the journey for the cyclist.
3	In the beginning of the cyclists journey, he is very happy and carefree. The cyclist comes to the first deserted town the setting isn’t described because the cyclist is not worried yet. After leaving the first town the cyclist barely noticed the heat because, “the cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite had my name written all over them.” The cyclist still has high spirits. The cyclist begins to get thirsty when he comes upon a water pump. He attempts to get water but the pump isn’t in working condition. Until this point in the story to road has been mostly flat and straight. Then the cyclist notices that the road has some hills in it. At this point the cyclist has no water and is very dehydrated. After one hill the cyclist sees a building. The building is an abandoned grape juice factory, which is ironic considering the state the cyclist is in. The cyclist sucks on rocks as a last resort and gives up hope of living , when he comes upon a fish camp. He gets water from the bathroom and all is well. The setting in this story affects the cyclist because as the setting changes, so do the cyclist moods and feelings about survival and the danger he is in.
2	The feature of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. When in the essay it states, “The sun was beginning to beat down” This shows that this affects how he feels when he is cycling through the road and this can affect his ability to keep cycling while the sun ??? him hard. Also when he states “I was doing a water-depleting 12 mph,” this shows he was also dehydrated once goin, very slow because of the ammount of heat and lack of water that affected his ability to keep cycling in the area.
1	I believe the cyclist is a alone, and I think the old man should have shot him. I believe a bike ride that long is a little retarded. I feel that no matter how great or horrible the shape your in you should even go on a realling long rider on a bicycle.
1	The setting affected the cyclist in a big way during his journey. The temperature being so hot tired the cyclist and made him thirsty. Also the hills being so high to ride up made it hard to continue. Since he was in the desert there were not many towns to go to. All these factors affected the cyclist on his journey.
3	The setting it the essay “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” in three ways. One way is that it is very baren so there is no shade to stop the sun that is beating down the the cyclist body which adds to his dehydration and lack of to focus. Another way the setting affects the cyclist is the terrain the rolling hills, and desert he bikes through the hills make him work harder using up more energy and exsusaing his ater supply the desert also with it enemies heat make his not trust himself thinks there mirages he sees. The last way it affects him is the ghost towns when he sees them he get a hope of relief that he might get water and out the heat but when he passes in he finds nothing and leaves him chrested and think of death.
1	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because, it is hot, and dry in the California desert when you are on a bicycle, hot and dry with bad directions, and in a desert is bad. It was a long distance ride, in the burning hot sun, with little water, and he thought he was going to die because there was nothing insight. 
2	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in more ways than one. For example in the short story &quot;Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,&quot; the cyclist had to endure going over big dirk hills while being dehydrated and tired from biking miles and miles to get to a destination. The setting can sometimes even cause you to lose hope and give up. The cyclist in the short story; started to lose hope until he found a store that sold fishing bait. The setting controls how long it takes you to getts your destination and how you get there. For example, if you come across a dirt road and theres a big boulder in the way, you have to find another way to get there. In conclusion, the features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways.
3	The setting effects the cyclist because he is in the California desert in June without water. He is also cycling up and down curry, hilly back roads. The cyclist eventually starts to lose water and his determination is tested as he struggles to get to the next town. He says “wide rings of dried sweet circled my shirt, and the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June simply because I listened to some old gentlemen who hadn’t been off their porch in decades. Caused me to lough.” The author is showing how the circumstances he is in are taking a toll on him. He also states a road sign “Rough Road ahead: Do not exceed posted speed limit.” This is ironic because he is already exhausted and now he is about to encounter a treachorous stretch of road. I have never cycled for long periods of time and can hardly imagine being pushed to such a state of exhaustion. I can relate it to a time I was played @NUM1 soccer games during the summer heat. It was painful and everytime I received the ball it took all I had to tack it.
1	In the story the features of the setting effect him because he was running out of water. He also had to manuver around a snake. It made him tired and dehydratied. His muscles got sore from the rough terrain. He got dehydratied from the sun.
6	Dear Newspaper People, I think that the effects that computers have on us are good. You should agree. One reason why you should agree is because computers are like teachers. For example, you can go on websites that teach you all kinds of things like math. Also you can go on cyber school or take college classes online. Another reason why you should agree with me is because on computers we can communicate easier. On computers, you can e-mail and use a webcam to talk to people. You can also have a facebook or myspace to chat and learn more about people. last of all, computers are for our entertainment. On computers, there are lots of games to play that are free. Also online you can watch movies and listen to music. Last, you can have fun creating games and stuff to share with everyone. Without computers we wouldn't be able to do any of those things anymore. I think that it would really suck and tons would agree with me. That is why you should agree with me that we
3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways because it’s almost like the background and theme of the cyclist The features used in this story are mostly about the background in which he is going and the sites of where he is. He’s showing the reader of how much he needs somewhere to go and also now much he’s indespair at the time. When he says “It was sad, hopeless laugh, mind you, but atleast I still had the energy to feel sorry for myself.” In this quote he is saying that he @MONTH1 be tired and physically not be in his best shape but atleast he knows he’s not in a good shape and he knows he’s in trouble, but he can still laugh it off and aware but he keeps trying anyways. This text in my opinion is showing many different ideas such as hope, awareness, and ability and courage to realize you need help but go on anyways to prove to yourself you can finish what you wanted and planned to do.
2	The features of the setting effect the cyclist because it is a dessert. The dessert is very hot. I know this because in the story, he states that it feels around @NUM1 degrees. He struggled for water but couldn’t find any that was cool. He found a water pump that had &quot;a tar like substance oozed out, followed by blackish water feeling somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees.” This means it was hot and couldn’t find water.
2	Many hazards and rigorous features affect the cyclist. He starts off his journey with the advice of a short cut from old men. The cyclist is very excited about the thought of a short cut and is drinking his water effectliy. Soon he begins to run lost and the sun begins to beat down on him. He take pressure in thinking about the cool stress of @CAPS1 and is then not bothered by the sun even the imaginary setting of fictious stream had an effect on the cyclist. Soon the sun starts to beat on him even more. The cyclist starts to run out of water and he makes sure the vivid he comes across is not a mirage. When he come over the bend he cave to his troubles road and thirst
3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. The cyclist persevered through the rough terrain which caused him to become weak. For example, the author states “looked the majority of the pavement in front of me and ceased past tilling to keep my balance in my dehydrated state.” This shows the author is dehydrated because it is so hot and he kept going even with a physical obstacle. Another thing that affected the author was that he felt like giving up because the terrain was too harsh. For instance in the text, “it didn’t really matter I was going to die and the birds will pick me cleary waveng only some experience outdoor gears.” This shows that the author still had to go even when time get tough. The text shows how exhausted he is by the winds eating at him when he dies. He would dehydrate to the humidity of the desert and heat. In other words, the features of the setting affected the cyclist in many ways.
1	The features of the setting affect cyclist because if you are going down hil and then hit a rough road you not going to do so good. Like for example he had been going on flat land then it changed to hills lastly into rough road. These conditions could seriously hurt someone.
2	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in a couple different ways. When the cyclist found the gohst town since no one was there he could not ask someone for better directions or get some food or water. The short rolling hills make it harder to pedal because it is hard to pedal uphill. At the end of the story he found a bait shop where he got water and better direction's.
1	The features of the setting affects the setting by all the big hills, and all the roughness of the roads. As the essay says ''flatroad was replaced by short, rolling hills. After I crested the first few of these a large highway sigh jumped out at me,” prety much what it is saying is the flat road soon turned into rolling hills. If I was the cyclist riding up the hills my legs would get very tired and sore after a while one example, is when my friend ,@PERSON1, and I went  bike riding, we went to @CAPS1 @CAPS2, in fechmisburg, and we had to ride up a big hill, so after a few pedals our legs started hurting, so we decided to just walk go the hill.
2	There are many ways in which the setting of “Rough Road ahead” affects the cyclist. First of all, he is bicycling through the desert. This poses a problem because it is very dry and hot. At one point in the story, the author writes that he was “trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state.” It is obvious here that lack of water is affecting his in a big way. He almost collapsed because he is so thirsty. Another part of the setting that affects the cyclist is that he is in a very remote area. He says that “there was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind. Since there was rolling now, the cyclist had to keep cycling and drinking his water until he could find a place to stop. Lastly, the “rough road” affected the cyclist. The road made traveling even harder to do and caused the cyclist to have a very rough time. If I had to bicycle for a long period of time, I would much rather have a smooth road so I could renew my energy. The heat, remotness of the area, and the rough road all affected the cyclist on his journey. 
1	The features of the setting affect the cyclist greatly in the story. The list desert climate tales damage onto the cyclist by quickly depleting his water supply. He also began to get worried when every town the old men told about turned out to be a ghost town. This crawled doubt in the cyclist mind that he might not survive the “shortcut” told off by the old men.  
1	The features in the setting effects the cyclist because there it different kinds of hills. He has watch out for rocks in the middle of the road. He has to make sure he has a lot of water because it looks like he is in the desert. There is no cars around but he still has to look for any cars in case they came out of nowhere. There is a lot of turns. It is very hot so he has to make sure he does not have a neat scaoke. There is no places where he can stop because there is no shade. There is no stores where he can stop &amp; get water and food at either. That is the setting of the cyclist.
10	People using computers is a good way for them to talk with distant relatives or friends, learn keyboarding skills, and research about far-away places. First, the wonder ful technology that computers have is amazing. They can surf the web in milli-seconds. This benefits people because if you were doing a research paper on china, many search engines let you surf the web at blazing fast speed, and in a little time, you could have all the information you needed. Scientists say that @PERCENT1 of computer-users have fast internet, and they reccommend it to other, first-time buyers. The computer that I use is a unique computer that was customizable to my liking. I like playing games and editing videos, so I got an outstanding graphics car that has outstanding speeds for rendering videos. This let me play games and edit videos, and my @NUM1 gb hard drive is capable of storing all my programs and projects, for future use. Doing many things on the computer can really help your hand-eye coordination. In fact, about @PERCENT2 of computer say that over a using a computer. they were to type @PERCENT3 quicker that they could before. Thats a very good number, but the average person woh types could write in @NUM2 in I have. I can type a that big in about @NUM3 minutes because it have been typing in other @NUM3. Computers are a big part of my life and I still have time to do other things with my family, and friends. The last thing that computers help us people with chatting with friends on websites, like facebook, myspace, and @ORGANIZATION1. They all let you share with all of your friends, and of you needed to, you could chat with far away friends or relatives. This helps because if you haven't talked to your cousin in a while, you can check up with him and talk about things. I have a causing who graduated college and is now teaching in @LOCATION1, and when our gets together, we webchat with him on @ORGANIZATION1 and it is helpful because we haven't seen him in @NUM5 years, and we all wanted to see what he was up to. He was also able to send us pictures, which helped because we all missed his face. So, blazing fast speed to chatting with distant relatives. These are key factors that show us that you can have fun on computers and still have time for family and friends.
1	@CAPS1   the  story  the  condition of  problem  often effected the mood of the cyclist . For  example when the sign said ,â€ Rough road ahead: Do not exceed  posted speed limit.â€ @CAPS1  this time he saw a snake he was scared so he eased  past trying to keep balance while he was  dehydrated . The dry and hot climate began to become problem for the cyclist.
1	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. For example he could have tried  if he drunk the battery taste water. or if he didn’t get enough clean water on time. Driving a bike on in a long distance, with no water or any other supples is very energy consuming. So you have to plan trips like that very wisly.  
2	In the story, the setting greatly affects the cyclist. The cyclist, pedaling through California, is obviously very hot in the “beautiful @DATE1.” He also runs out of water, which nearly dooms him. But that’s not the worst of it. The hills make him run out of water and energy even quicker. There are also no places to stop for water. The cyclist is lucky he survived the rugged terrain of California.
1	The features of the setting afect the cyclist in many ways. If he wasn’t in “High deserts of California in June” he probaly wouldn’t be dehydrated if he was in @DATE1 it wouldn’t be so hot out. Also if there weren’t “short rolling hills” he would have had more energy. As you can see setting affects the cyclist a lot.
1	There were many features that affect the cyclist. Lack of water slowed him down. Also the hills and sun were a big problem.
2	In the story “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed limit,” the featurs of the setting had a great deal to do with the cyclist. The rodes were bumpy, windy, and many hills. As the effect of that the cyclist had to drink a lot of water. As the cyclist rode into the so called town he found nothing, as he says “I began to pump the old rusted water pump, but nothing came out except nasty blackish water.&quot;
1	The way the features of the setting effect  the cyclist in what was, going through hot neighborhoods and very road that made her dehydrated and effected her journey including the long cycling which he had to go up.
2	In the story, the cyclist starts out with a lot of confidence that he can complete the whole ride. But after he left first town he had been riding and needed water, so he stoped at a fork in the road he had just to;to get water from a pump which tastes like battery acid. Then as he progressed further in his trip he came to a sign that said “Rough Road Ahead: Do not exceed speed limit”(Joe Kurmaskie pg @NUM1) This part of his trip made it very challenging by making him face rough roads and mountains that he had to cross which sucked the water out of him. Then as  he came over the last mountain, he saw a sign for a gart store. So when he arrived he got some water and got directions for a man who had the best map. So you can see that going over an the mountains, sucks all the water out of the cyclist, so he was so relieved when he got the water at the end.
2	The features of the setting in the essay entitled “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” affect the cyclist in an tagonizing manner. He is dehydrated and exhausted due to the conditions of the environment he was in. the cyclist became dehydrated because of not only a lack of water, but also the scorching heat of the desert. He sweat to much to the point that he lost an enormous amount of bodily fluids. The cyclist also was traveling on unpaved road which required more energy than traveling on one that is paved. Therefore the cyclist became so exausted that he almost died. These are the ways the environment the cyclist was in affected him.
2	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in ways of feeling doubtful, confidence, determination and relief. For example he feels doubtful when he has hardly any water and has no clue where he is or where he is going to end up. He first felt confident when the old people on the porch told him how to go and then at the end when he says he will listen to his map next time. He was also was determined because he wanted to get to the next town which he does, that also makes him relived, and wants to get to Yosemite National Park. That is how the setting affects the cyclist.
8	Dear local newspaper, Computers have a good effect on people in our comunnite, from computers you can learn, talk to people from out of state or even out of the county, also you can learn hand eye cornation. Computer can help you earn in many ways one way you could learn from computers is students can go online and got information for their school projects by finding this information it can help the students get better grades. Also the students can use the computer as a way to study. There are educational games on the computer that kids play and without knowing this they are learning and studying for school. Another way you could too a is from online classes. This could help people also because do not have enough many to pay to go to classes. As you can see there are many ways to learn from having computer. The computer can also help you talk to people from out of the state or country. This could help famlies stay connected when they live so far away from you. My cousin @PERSON4 and my aunt @CAPS1 math live in @LOCATION1 and i hadn't met then until the @DATE1, when they came down. @CAPS3 that i have met them i am able to stay them through the computer. Dr. @PERSON2 says, &quot;@CAPS2 close with familys and friends not only important for you you health.&quot; by haveng computers we could talk to our relative and help our health. When you get out of college people let go of some good friends because they could live in different state,. the computers can help you stay connected with them. Lastly, computers can help you with you hand eye coodination, when your hand eye cornation because you are trying to type a word. and by hitting the key you want you are learning this. I have sam kids with special needs useing the computer is help them learn hand eye cornation. there is a girl in my school named @PERSON3 and the help her by leting her play games on the computer when in my class ive had to help her with picking things up, @CAPS3 to eat and walk with her hands alone. Her helper teacher. Ms @PERSON1 says the computer game has helped her. The effect that compuers have on society is good.
3	The features of the setting in which the cyclist is in change his outlook on the trip. When he first begins his trip, the road is fine, so he becomes confident. When the terrain began to change, he writes, “sometimes life can feel so cruel”, he grows despairing as he faces new terrain with so little water. When he begins to see a building, he becomes hopeful and determined. However, when he realizes its old juice factory, he grows bitter. When he leaves the factory, he feels ??? all hope. The comparison can be shown when he writes, “somehow i climbed away from the abandoned factory of of juice and dreams, slowly gaining elevation while losing hope.&quot; @CAPS1 the end, when he is revived with water he almost looks back on the journey comically. The rider knows that his out look drastically changed depending on setting through his journey
3	The features of california and the fact that the cyclist was neave Yosemite made the terrain rugged and dangerous to the cyclist california has a very hot climate, and is neove  a desert, so the need for water for the cyclist was much greater man if the had been cyclist in @LOCATION1. In the story, the cyclist had to travel through desert-like conditions with a limited water supply. The cyclist even mentioned in the story how many hours into the ride the land changed to “ short, rolling hills,” which would have made it harder to pedal, and making him work harder, in the story, he also mention how the sun was beating down on him, and that would alos serve as a factor thout helped deplete his hydration. Through all of the problem the cyclist faced nowever, he managed to stay determined, when other people faced with his problems might not have been able to make it through. Also, in the story you @MONTH1 notices that in the different stages of his struggle, the authours tone ananger from confidient , to unsure, to desser
3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. It made him tired thirsty and he was near exaustion.
3	The cyclist in the essay “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” took the advice of older gentlemen who offered him a shortcut they knew to get to @CAPS1 national park. However, the land had changed long ago after these men were last here. The fist town he came upon was a realistic version of a ghost town. He laughed at how long ago those men must have been here. Long hours on the hot road and with dipleted water, @CAPS2 sank in. He lost almost all hope when he reached an old and destroyed grape juice factory. He had made it to a bait store for water at last. He would never take the advice of anyone but his map again.
2	The features of the setting affects the cyclist by letting the author have hope . When he came across a sign which read &quot;Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit, his hope was faint because he was doing a water-depleting @NUM1 per hour. Because of the rate of the water, he felt life was cruel sometimes and he thought that he was at the point of losing water. Also when he came across the tumbleweeds and the large snake he tried to avoid them. If he would have been bitten he would have died. Finally because of the heat he might have also did from the heatsroke &quot;wide signs  of   dried&quot;       
3	In the story “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit”many features of the setting challenge the cyclists.The cyclist accepts information from foreign old people which made his first mistake.After realizing this he,“I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly,and i was traveling through the high deserts of California,in June”the lack of water plus the heat in California,in june would have turned to heatstroke for most people.Even further into the journey,even with all those things against him it states,“flat rode was replaced by short,rolling hills,&quot;@CAPS1 not only did he have excessive heat,and no water,but @CAPS1 he was handed troublesome rodes too.Although the cyclist must have been near to complete exhaustion,he continued through.Fighting all adds,and elements,many features in the setting of this story affected the cyclist,but he overcame them honorably.
3	The dry desert like setting would affect the cyclist because he could easily become dehydrated from the sun, and loss of water through sweat. The cyclist states, “I eased past, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state” (Rough Road Ahead). The man is badly dehydrated, but in his determination he moves on. The terrain went from being flat, to short rolling hills. The road had been abandoned along with the town he had passed through, hoping to get water. The man goes can to say, “ I toiled on, at some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake- it really did look like a diamond back- blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me &quot;(Rough Road Ahead). The setting is obviosly desert like, so it is dry, hot, and dusty. This would definately have an affect on his body which is sweating, which causes dehydration due to water loss. In conclusion the cyclist was greately affected by the setting.
2	The features of the setting effected the cyclist quite durastrely. First of all, he was “traveling through the high deserts of California in June.” He was running out of water and the pump he found only produced.” brakish water feeling somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees. “and” had the flavor of battery acid.” Then he came upon “rolling  hills” and “Rough @CAPS1.” By the end, he was exausted, dehidrated, and in desperate need of water. The turain made the story more meaning full in proving that you souldn’t get directions from old guys. 
2	In the essay, &quot;Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,&quot; the cyclist encountered several problems. The main conflict of the cyclist in this text is the lack of water. Cycling is a vigorous exercise and can take much strength out of a rider. Water is neccesary to make sure the cyclist stays hydrated. In the text, the old men had the cyclist take a detour through desert areas and hilly terains. Because of the hot weather and rough roads the cyclist became dehydrated faster than normal. For  example, the text says, &quot;The water bottles contained only a few tentalizing sips, wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that i could drop from heatsroke on a gorgeouse day in June.&quot; @CAPS1, by usings vocubulary such as &quot;tentalizing&quot; expresses the cyclist need for water. Furthermore, later in the sentence the narrator make a reference to the old men, giving the blame entirely to them for them suggesting the path. Readers can also can conclude that the harsh setting of the essay greatly affected the cyclist
2	The features of the setting affect the cyclist by making his travel a lot harder. The weather was very hot making him very thirsty and due to the towns being abandoned, he could not stock up on water. The terrain that he had to cross had many hills and the road was not in good condition. With the heat, lack of water, ghost towns, and tough terrains, made his journey a very hard achievement to overcome. With all these obstacles in his way, he was able to achieve his goal of getting water.
5	Hi do you think that if you use the computers too much then you will not exercis and you will not enjoy the outside nature with talking and playing with your friends and family will do not because computers are need for over needs and one click can help lot of people and can save live and the more advances over technology become. We will all so advances like or help a person look for a need jod and you can still talk or chat with best friends or just your grand mom. The computer can help with your home work or someone to lern to talk in english and to jump start than new jod or store and so they can but that ther her will like and buy so if they like it they will come back for more to higher more people and to make it into lot of store and all so and good reson the computer is good to cook food and to make new resifes all in one clik of the mose.
3	The story Rough Road ahead: Do not exceed Posted Speed limit&quot; by Joe Kurmaskie was about a man traveling through some pretty difficult settings. The cyclist’s mood was detirmined by the setting as well as his needs and his detirmination to make it. The setting of the story early summer in California. The weather is described as hot as, &quot;The sun [began] to beat down.&quot; He, &quot;was traveling through the high deserts of @CAPS1 can June.&quot; Because of the excessive heat, he needed more water, which shortly became the conflict of this story. As things got more difficult his attitude towards the old men’s advice changed from gracious for their help to wishing he had never listened to them. Also as the difficulty increased his detirmination to move on also increased by, &quot;telling [himself] if [he] could make it that far, [he’d] be fine.&quot; @CAPS2 for the cyclist, the settings affect was negitive.     
2	In the story “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit. Their are many features that affected the cyclist. For example, “The sun was beginning to beat down.” they were starting to get hot, than tired. Than when he came to all the bumps in the road, It was harder to pedal. He was also drinking his bottle of water hard. So that means he's hot getting tired and lost “I got down on my hands and knees working the handle of the rusted water pump with all my strength” That is telling us he’s working too hard, than he’ll be worn out to ride. Those are reason's why features affected the cyclist. 
1	First, the old men affect the cyclist by throwing him off track. They do this by telling him of a “shortcut” that will take him right to his destination. Then the cyclist was faced with rough rolling hills of a highway. Over his long journey the cyclist still remained determined to reach his destination.
1	The features of the setting affects the cyclist in many ways. If the cyclist was riding his bike in @LOCATION1 in he middle of June he wouldn’t of gotten so dehydrated. This biker is riding in the high deserts of California that reach to @NUM1° degrees. In the middle of @DATE2 in @CAPS1.A it bearly reaches @NUM2° degrees. Also the desert is know to have nothing. If he was riding somewhere else every mile there could be a gas station. Although this cyclist is riding in “No @CAPS2’s @CAPS3”. Lastly the roads in the desert are a lot more dangerous, since people never really drive through, no one really comblains regularly about pot holes and stuff. They are more worried about the cities were many people travel, there is no point to change or fill pot holes where no one really travels.
2	The setting really takes determination away from the cyclist. The were hills that made his ride difficult. It says, “over one long cripping hill, a bulding came into view.” This shows the hills were hard on him because he says they were long and crippling. Another thing in the setting was the building. He was extremely thirsty and becomes he to an abandoned grape juice factory it said, ''by the looks of a had beth a @CAPS1 Grape Juice Factory and bottling plant.” These were two of several examples of the setting affecting the cyclist.
2	The features of the setting have a major affect on the cyclist. It is a very hot day and he is in a desert in California with a limited water supply. It starts becoming very hot, and his water supply begins to decrease quickly. The old men who he says “have not left their porch since @PERSON1 was in office” gave him very wrong directions to Yosemite and he ended up getting lost out in a hot California desert. He eventually came to a fishing store where he refreshed with alot o f water from the sink, and then was off again on his way to Yosemite.
2	The features of the setting affect the cyclists in a big way because roads had bottles in then that could have caused him to get really hurt. Also, the water he was drinking was streaming and tasted like battery acid. Then came some rolling hills which would be another big challenge for him. The setting was pretty baron for the cyclist because he also come across a snake. Last, he thought he saw some mirages that tells me that the climate is extreme for the cyclists. That’s how the setting affects the cyclists.
3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist for a few reasons. One reason is that it makes it easier to picture how the cyclist feels. Also it makes the cyclist seem a bit insane for doing what he’s doing in weather that he could, “drop from heatstroke.” @CAPS1 reason is that the weather is affecting the cyclist so bad that he’s seeing a mirage of a “building-abandoned years ealier.” The features of the setting affect the cyclist because the conditions seem impossible to make it in.
1	Throughout the story, the cyclist describes the hot weather and harsh tarrens of the midwest in his quest to find a source of water. He notes several times about the nice @DATE1, which ear him, quickly warms into sweltering heat as he pedals along. He also goes into detail about the change from flat ground to rolling hills on his journey. Behind these aspects make the use frol final much inorder  for the cyclist and gives the reader image as what he is going through.
3	In the article “Do not exceed the posted speed limit,” the features of the setting took toll on the cyclist in many ways. First off the whole Setting was a dry, dusty not desert that would chair anybody. “The sun was beginning to beat down, but i borely noticed it.” The own affected the cyclist by dehydrating him so much, which bring me to the next point. “I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly and i was traveling through the high deserts of california in June. This caused him to become even more dehydrated, resulting in him thinking he was going to die. Along the way he found an old abandoned juice factory. This affected him by filling him with despair and hopelessness, causing him to push more and more to reach water. In the end the feature of the setting only made him more determined to reach water.
10	Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 of late there has been controversy of how Computers affect people's lives. I believe that the effects on people negative. My main reasons of this argument are. The persons health their the users well being. Did you know that over @PERCENT1 of kids and teens are obese @NUM1 computers can contribute to this statistic. If a person is eating unhealthy but sizing. They can still be fit but if they go on the computer instead of working off all the. They become fat. This can be a serious problem. Becoming overweight has many health risks liked heart other. It also could prevent a person from excersicing. If they are overweight their legs could ache and a simple set of stairs could become a huge challenge. Do you want in obesity rates? I would think not. If you watch tv you could picture perfect families. We all know that no family is like that. Introducing computers could mess up that fact even more. For example, my cousin used to be an outgoing friend person. Now because of computers he is a @LOCATION1 who does nothing else but play on the computer. He gets up eats breakfast. (The of about ), then plays on the computer untill lunch. He eats a small lunch and right back to playing. After along @NUM2 to @NUM3 more hows of playing. He off the computer, hopps into goes on his laptop all night. This greatly affects his family. They try to get him off but all he does is online. He cant interact with his family and this has a huge infact on it. Even though he could get off and talk one of the only ways of talking to him are through facebook. Now because of this family is. We can easily avoid this by telling every body these known facts. My final argument for you is the users well being teen many of us have a facebook of @CAPS3 I have homework I to use the internet for facts and stories. @CAPS3 I do so to go on facebook. If anyone dows the effect our grades. If we chat on facebook we doing our. If arent doing our homework we wont get a good grade. If we could less to other serious problems. Another thing is that you could actually need your computer to stay. It could be addicting and you might rely on it &quot;once a to kill himself because he dident have his computer&quot;. So @CAPS2 you can see there many negative effects on a user of a computer. It could many problems inthe future like health. the family happiness. So spread the word for the sake of thousands of people.
2	The setting affected the cyclist in many ways, One way was the weather. In the story it said “I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June” (kermaskie @NUM1). Thats quote said he is in a desert and desert are usally warm. It also said in June and June is usally a hot temp month. The weath affected the cyclist because it was hot and he started to become dehydrated and had little water. Another way the setting affected the cyclist was the souroundings. In the story it said. “There was no one in sight not a building, car or structure of any kind “(kurmaskie). That saying there know one around to help him so if he gets hurt or something. Also theres no where to get some water.
3	Many of the features of the setting effect the cyclist. The most obvious and direct feature would be that this adventure took place in the “high deserts of California in June.” @CAPS1 about that passage says blistering heat; high meaning its going to be closer to sun, deserts, where the world is hot, California, which is known to be smoggy, and June, which is the middle of summer. Also, the closet water supply was “somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees,” there was a “long crippling hill” all while the sun was heating down.  All of that would most obviously effect the cyclists by making him tired, which he vividly explains by expressing his fears of losing conscionous.
2	In the story, “Do not exceed posted speed limit” by Joe Kurmaskie, The features of the setting affect the cyclist. One example is when the cyclist says “I noticed the terrain changing, Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills” This effects the cyclist because it makes him work harded when he is dying of thirst. Especially on a hot summer day. It makes his muscles work harder and use his strength more. In the summer time it is extremely hot. When the cyclist is biking it is very hot, he says”… in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees.” After this quote he is explaining the difficulty of getting flustrated an there’s No cold water. This affects the cyclist to think about water and not bothering to think about where he is at he could be lost. He didn’t have a good map.
3	As the cyclist goes on his trip, he is met with many dreary places and people. For starters, the old men he knew he shouldn’t have trusted but did any way. This led him through the desert. Even in a car the desert can be a very despairing place. On a bicycle it must be even worse knowing that if you run out of water op one will be there to save you from dehydration. Just the endlessly bleak landscapes also played a roll in the cyclist feelings. Another bad feature is the endless amount of abandonment towns and spoiled water. Every time he thought he was saved he was put down again by that fact. For example he had to pump for minutes only to get bad tasting water. Finally just when his strength was to give out he found the bait place &amp; water and that dramatically and a place to rest too bad there was another old man there, isn’t it?! 
1	IIn the essay the features of the cycleist affect the setting because the readers wouldnt have thought that he was in that bad of danger if he hadnt of been going through the desert. When the cyclist got to the grape factory he stated that he was almost dehydrated. And then when he got to the bait shop he drank from the faucet.
2	The features of the setting affect the cyclist by their were rolling hills that went up and down and it to alot of streanth and also he barely had water because, it was so hot he kept drinking and ran out of water early. In the story it say when he was riding that “ He barely noticed that the sun was starting to beat down.” This quote shows it was starting to get hot. Also, in the story he says “ I checked my water supply.” @CAPS1 means he’s starting to realize his waters running short. So in all the setting is hot abandoned and theirs no water source, so  the cyclist is being affected by all of this
1	SETTING WAS A IMPORTANT FACTOR IN THE STORY. I WAS A DESSERT IN A DESSERT THERE IS A LACK OF WATER. AND ME WAS IN A BIKE THAT IS DANGEROUS. BECAUSE YOU ARE USING YOUR FEET TO MOVE WHICH TAKES OUT ENERGY, AND USES WATER FROM YOUR BODY.
2	The features of the setting affected the cyclist because he was biking up hills in extreme heat. He also had a short water supplyl while head in the wrong direction.
2	The features of the setting affect the cyclist. The directions given to the cyclist by the elderly was incorrect and he got lost. The lack of water led to the possibility to sucking pebbles to forget about his thirst. The rolling hills caused the cyclist to use more energy.These were the affects the setting had to the cyclist.
1	The feachers of the setting affected the cyclist greatly. When she biked around a bend, “my troubles, thirsts, and fear were all behind me.”
9	Dear local newspaper, I feel that computers are very useful to society. For example, millions of people and companies and small buisnesses require the use of computers in order to optimally run their buisness. Everyone who uses computers on a daily basis can confirm that they are very useful. In fact, computers are so useful, some schools are starting to notice. I hightly reccomend that you get aquanted with such a useful and very recognized plece of technology. Did you know that many billion-dollar companies and small buisnesses require the uses that a computer has to offer? For example, my mother is s former-district manager of the fast-food company, @ORGANIZATION1. When she worked at the company, they gave her a laptop that she could use only for her work. This proves my point that companies and small buisnesses require the features of a computer to smoothly run the buisness of which they run or one employed at. The technology of computers has brought education to new. Some teachers (including my own, @PERSON1) have taken the initiative to incorporate the modern technology of computers into their teachings. Classes have even been created in schools because of the popularity of computers. For example, at my school, a computer education (or, comp, for short) class has been created for kids to understand the knowledge and skills using a computer can give to them in the real-world. In my opinion, I it is great that computers are incorporated in so many places. Computers are used by millions of people every day. Such buisnesses are corporate like @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 are starting to see the brilliance in using computers in their company. In fact, computers are so useful and helpful, teachers have taken up using computers in their classrooms. I hope it is not just me that sees the good that a computers brings, but anyone else that @MONTH1 have taken a glare at this letter.
2	In the story “Rough Road Ahead” by Joe Kurmaskie, A cyclist set out on a bike ride in the heat of summer in California where he will staying he met some old people who gave him a “short cut”. As he forms out most of the places he was told about were abandoned ghost towns without a single drop of drinkable water. If he were in a different setting like by a river or spring he would just stop and drink from that. Or even if he was in a more populated, industriated area he could stop in any building and ask for a drink; But he was in the dry, hot, abadond hills of California without any water. Under these conditions he grew tired, thirsty; dehydrated; and desperate for a drink finally he came apon a bait shop that had water there
2	Durring the cyclist @CAPS1 he was affected by the setting frequently. When he was cycling it be came very hott to him but at first it wasn’t so bad. “The sun was begining to beat dow, but I barely Noticed it.” This proves that the cyclist knows it was getting hot but it did not affect him. Another thing that affected him was the time that he was travling in. “I had been hitting my water bottles pritty regularly and I was travling through the high dezerts in califonia in June.” This proves that the reader was constantly drinking because of the time of day and year he was out. All of this shows that the setting affected the cyclist on his @CAPS2. 
1	I think that the features of the setting really do affect the way someone rides a bike because certain places have certain terrain. Some types are not always good for a bike rider because if it’s bumpy then someone could fall off the bike. Also, if it is dark you @MONTH1 not even be able to see where you are going then you could hurt your-self very seriously. That’s why riding a bike is dangerous. Also, if your in the type of enviroment where every thing is smooth then you @MONTH1 be able to have a nice bike ride.  
3	The features of the setting effect the cyclist in, “Do not Exceed posted speed Limit.” By changing him physically. He was in the California desert in the middle of June without any water left. This was taking a physical toll on him. His physical effect was making him feel hopeless as well. He says, “It was a sad hopeless laugh mind you, but at least l still had the energy to feel sorry for myself.&quot; So the way he was suffering from dehydration physically effected his emotional state because he felt as though there was nothing he could do. Had he been in another place, for example @LOCATION2, where it does not get newly a shot as soo thon California, he would not have been suffering from dehydration, as have been in such an isolated place. His cycling could be compared to the climbers who were lost in the snow storm in @LOCATION3. Instead of dehydration and heat strone, however they suffered from hypothermia. Had they been on a different mountain, there would have been no snow storm and they would be fine. The outcome of this story and the climbers was determined by their setting.
3	The conditions gave the cyclist no hope at some points because the heat of the land the of the features of the setting were so harsh he had no hope like when the cyclist says I hope I make It to the horizon because theres nothing else to compare. He can’t say lets ride to the next building or mail box because there are none. The desert features make the cyclist fell that its just him no one can help him he’ll die of dyhydration. Then the features get worse he sees the welchs grape fruit building giving him little hope of survival then he finds out that its deserted and that’s like the final thing he gives up. The cyclist almost unconscious then runs into the fishing store where he has a sip of water. So the features were the main reason the cyclist lost hope.
2	The features of setting affect the author because it moves him dehydrated. The dessert sun look sweat out of him and he had no water to bring that would replace his electrolites . Also, once the author had got into the hills he had lost a lot of his energy so peddling up his was a lot of work. If I were the author I would also have gotten tired because you need water in your body to survive.
3	The features of the setting in “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” affect the cyclist greatly. In the cyclists opinion things began pretty well. He had a positive attitude as it states “with strong legs and a smile on my face.” As the man moves on he comes to a fort of sorts. To him, the sight was troubling. Though troubling, he still had the confidence that he could continue. Next he noticed the changes in the terrain. He explained “Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.” This means that he would have to peddle harder and with greater force in order to get over the hills. The weather was not and the cyclist was running out of water. The possibility of heatstroke came to mind. “There was no one in sight, not a building, car or structure of any kind”, as told by the man. His mind entered a state of sad, and hopeless thoughts, but he persevered and cycled on. At this point he was very thirsty and felt his death was near. He said “I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean” As he kept going he spotted an old guy in sight. He regained hope and moved ahead. The features of this story affected the cyclist physically and mentally. Physically he was tired and worn out. A like this horrible state, mentally he was becoming negative and pessamistic about his travel. The setting's features interfered with the cyclist's physical and mental state.
2	In this story, “No Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit”, by be Joe Kurmaskie I believe the setting greatly affect the cyclist. I believe this because when it’s long downhill cool roads is fine but if it is straight uphill roads and extremely hot he feels like he can’t keep pedaling. The cyclist gets very weary when the setting is out in the hot desert with no one around so the setting has a huge affect on the mood in this story. Another example
1	A cyclist is a bike rider. They can be in groups of diffrent people or they can be a solo cyclist. Some cyclist go for a few miles riding there bikes some can go for more like @NUM1 miles, some go over hills, go trow water they do alot with what they do. They have alot of time on there hards to ride a bike that far.
1	The setting is hot like desert, no one around, and very dry. Being hot outside affects the cyclist because he is sweaty and needs water. The heat wears him down. Having no one around causes him to not get water which he needs for his journey. These things make him week and makes it harder for him to find a place to get water.
8	Dear, To who it @MONTH1 concer, I am writing this to inform about how the ocmputers benefits society. I think computers aren't that great because people use certain websites. People use @CAPS1 messaging and its also a way getting connected to others. I also think that some people ae addicted because you can search someone or @CAPS5. You find top websites that maybe inapropriate for users who use the computers. Some computers are bad education to some kids who are trying to learn majority of kids use computers for internet access most kids will be on the computer playing games that @MONTH1 not be suitable for the age group. My first reason is when people get on the computer they find websites that others use. For example: @CAPS2, @CAPS3, @ORGANIZATION1, ect. Many people use websites to check the emails. For exmaple: @ORGANIZATION2, @LOCATION1L, @CAPS4.mail, ect. My other reason to you why people use websites is for @CAPS1 messaging. People sue @CAPS1 messaging to connect with their friends, family, &amp; other people they @MONTH1 not know. People say its a faster connection to people @MONTH1 not could reach. For example: person doesn't have a phone, the person does not live close by &amp; the person lives in another town. I also think it good research to browse people. For example you know someone but you can't find you can browse. Another second one is people maybe addicted. For example: they go on website &amp; they go on it over &amp; over &amp; over again. they don't stop using it until it gone. In additional people think it keeps them busy. For example you don't have anything to do go on the computer. Lastly you find top websites that maybe inapropriate for users. For example, you find a website but its not suitable for minor. Only @CAPS5 adults could watch. One more thing computers aren't bad education. For example you can learn from apropriate websites that builds brain muscles. My opinion is that I do think computers benift the society because it mainly helps you brain storm &amp; you get to know websites &amp; learn about them.
0	The setting affect the cyclist because it could be a good or bad thing. If a cyclist adjust his own settings thats good but if somebody messe with them that could be bad.
3	In this narritive of a cyclist, riding in california, and handed for Yosemite national park, he encounters a lack of water and bad directions from a group of old men on a pourch. The setting plays a big part in his &quot;challenge&quot;, from the pine trees to the barren hills. In the begining of his trie he passes a &quot;gbost town&quot; that has clearly seen better days. This presents him with his first doubt and he continues with caution. Then the pines that, &quot;had my name written all over them.&quot; This gives him hope and reassurance. Then the rusty pump and &quot;ramshackle shed.&quot; They took the hope and reasurance away, making him cautrous. The hills that made him work hard to get over, the snake that slowed him down and the whelches juice company that was abundanded all didn't help and made matters worse. Then he got some water at a bathroom and it was all better. It the setting has less the same the whole way he wouldn't have had any hope or he would have hope but it wouldn't fall and rise, making the story interenting.   
2	Winding hills limited water and poor directions are the troubles of this cyclist. First he gets very bad directions from a group of old men that have not been outside of their porch in awile, then he gos through the first town and does not fill is water bottles then he gets lost and runs out of water but finds a fishing store where there is water and people that give him a better map.
2	No water, and no direction effects the cyclist. Water effect cyclist because he said in the essay “I could drop from heatstroke&quot; (Kurmaskie). also no direction is another big one. It is important because without direction he is going to rideing for a long time. In conclusion water and no direction was the cyclist problem in the story
2	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because he thought he packed enough water so he began on his way he drank most of his water less than half way to his destination. He didn’t realize how hot it was until he got down to his last couple of sips of water. He started to become dehydrated he rembered the old men said that the next town was abait eighteen miles away so he kept on going when he reached the town there was nothing to drink just an old run down factory. He took same rocks and sucked on them, he went over a bump had swallowed it. He said to him self next time he would just go by what the map said everything he had gone past on the way had been run down and abandoned. Finaly he reached a bait shop and when inside the bathroom and got some water.
1	The features of the setting affected the cyclist grate deal. For example, it was not and hill goet dehydrated. He went down this rusty-bumpy road, which didnt help his dehygration And another example would be he found a plane was he could set a change and find the best way to get where he was going. That the features on the setting affection the cyclist.
2	The cyclist goes through many natural settings that affect him. First of all he rides into barren land. The cyclist portrayed this barrenness by saying “it fit the traditional definition of a ghost town.” This was in response to the first “town” he came across. Next he speaks of a large snake that came close to him which is dangerous, but luckily he manuvers out of its way. But the worse setting the cyclist had to deal with was the lack of water. This is a threat to any living creature. But in the end he found some water and the story ended fine.
3	In the essay “Rough Road ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” the setting relates to how the author is feeling. At first, when the author sees the abandoned first “town” he is not too worried about it and moves on. “I chuckled, checked my water supply, and moved on. The sun was beginning to beat down, but I barely noticed it.” The author is okay right @CAPS1, and still has enough water. Next he starts to get low on water, and he becomes more panicked; which in return makes the day seem even hotter. “I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly, and I was traveling through the high deserts of california in June.” @CAPS1 that the author is low on water the day seems worse afterward he continues on and runs into a rattlesnake, which makes him even mere panicked “and a ridiculously large snake. It really did look like a diamond back-blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me. I eased past, trying to keep my balanc in my dehydrated state.” @CAPS2, when he got to the bait store and drank from the sink; things didn’t seem so bad anymore and there was no more talk about water nor the heat. As a result the setting was related to the author’s moods.
3	The features of the setting did affect the cyclist in this small story. In this story the setting is a hot dry terrain which can be better explained by the name California. This heat of the desert climate seems to start have an effect on him about after he reaches the first town. I know this by his statement.”This place might have been a thriving little spot at time –say, before the last war-but on that morning it fit the traditional definition of a ghost town. I chucked, checked my water supply and moved on. The the sun was beginning to beat down. The summer heat is thriving how during this @DATE1 and he is drinking lots of water.”So this setting does affect him greatly it causes him to use his water supply and it causes him to begin the process of dehydration. I know how the summer heat can affect you during @DATE1 activity ‘s. At times it feelslike you are going to die but that building is always around the bend just for the cyclist.  
3	In Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit, the features of the setting are devastating to the cyclists condition. &quot;@CAPS1 through the high desert of California&quot; is surely never an easy task to begin with. Without proper hydration, people often suffer heatstrokes or pass out, sometimes even perishing, it is entirely worse for this cyclist because of the effort he is exerting, pedaling over “short, rolling hills.” Even worse, the trail a few very old, eccentric men set run on doesn’t do much in the way of nuping with a depleted water supply. The first town the cyclist comes across easily splits “the traditional definition of a ghost town” and the only other water pump he comes to emits only sewage and incredibly hot brackish water. Therefore, the heat is only made worse by the look of water on the cyclist path. This combination of features in then setting causes a great deal of distress to the cycling, and almost pushing him to death.
8	Dear @CAPS1 times, I am writing in regards to the article recently writen in your newspaper on computors. I believe that they are a vital part of the world today because; you can find information for protect or article in far less time then searching through books, you can get important news updates and entertainment is only a click away. My first reason was at the information on the internet. Say you were writing a paper on acient egyptians, and you need to know how to spell hiroglipics in a dictionary that would take a few minutes, online it would take about @NUM1 seconds. Or if you wanted to know when @ORGANIZATION1 died. It would take hours scouring textbooks untill you finally found it. on time it might take your just over a minute. The second reason I like computors is for news updates. You can figure out what happened in recent natural disasters, or how your stock is doing. Also computers helped us in the recent election, and will continue do so for a long time. The weather can always be found on time web for any in the world. This is a bad thing if you're planning a trip somewhere, wich you can also do with a computor. My third and final reason is that its hard to get bored on a computor. Every where on the web are cool gamesor funny videos. On the web there are about @NUM2 gaming sites and @NUM3 sites with funny/weird/cool videos and pictures. Many other places like facebook let you share picures with your friends, family, and relatives. Or you can chat with complete strangers from around the world. So next time you need information, news, or you are just bored go on your computor, and have fun.
1	There are many ways the setting affected the cyclist in this story like the weather, supply of food and water, wrong estimation for old people and the road. First off the weather was was very dry and it was two hundred degrees, so it made you sweat and hard to breath. The supply of water was harsh not much around at all and when he tryed to get water the pumps would pump out not water. The weather and water supply were two maijor affects on the cyclist.
3	In the beginning of the story the author is happy, but towards the end grows upset. &quot;I rode into the morning with strong legs and a smile on my face” (@NUM1). This shows how the author is in a good mood and happy to be there. She is on a journey, and no one can touch her. Then the story takes an unexpected turn. “With what I believed was my last burst of energy, I maneuvered down the hill,” (@NUM2). After getting lost in a town that seems distant from any living things the author hears people! She is extremely reliefed to have found anyone of help to her. She gets water and is forever greatful. The setting is horrifying to her because you will feel like you cant even if you live there! She felt alone and that she would die. If the setting was in a city surrounded by buildings the author would still feel some security even without water
1	The features of the setting affect the cyclist. The reasons were the water and the hills. One reason was water because his water were cooled down offer he refilled it all the way up. My last reason is because of the rolling hills.
2	There are features such as blazing heat coming off the sun, “short, rolling hills”, and no water. There was also the fact that the rider thought he was in the middle of nowhere. This has a great effect on the cyclist, both physical and emotional. The heat, lack of water and constant up hill riding can take a lot of energy out of someone and make it extremely hard to ride. Not to mention there isn’t much hope left so that eliminates the whole mind over matter thing. All the features of the setting put together can lead to major trouble.
3	Features of the setting affected the cyclist in many ways. After about @NUM1 miles, when in need of water supply the cyclist found a rusty pipe which a tarlike substance came out, then a brackish water substance. While cycling, you are in need of clean water. Next, the terrain changed from being flat to very hilly. In need of water,the last thing you need is be to be challeged more. Later on down the food, there were no cars or any buildings in sile. When you are feeling the the worst, you would want someone to he near in case you fall out, but no one was in site on that road. Lostly, seeing the old welch's Grape Juice Factory would affect the cyclist. Seeing that image of a drink factory right infront of you but not business has to make them fell like he/she will never make it. These features of the setting had to affect the cyclist.
2	The features in the setting dramaticaly affect the cyclist. Everything was fine until he ran out of water and reached the hills. Now if he was in callada he woudn’t of dehydrated. But the hills were sure to play with his mind. The most import setting is the welchs grape juice factory. He would have had all of the grape juice he wanted, but it was abandoned. An ironic twist “as he calls it. And the last one is hte bait shop that sawes his life, where an old man offers him directions.
2	The features of the setting effect the cyclist because he was in the middle of no-where with no water or direction. The man was also very thirsty and had no water left in his water bottle, he began to get very thirsty. I found an example to show that he was thirsty. “The speed limit was @NUM1. I was doing a water-depleting @NUM2. Sometimes life can feel so cruel”. By saying he was doing @NUM2 when it should have been @NUM1. was saying he was getting very exhausted and he needed water to get him feeling refreshed once again. Also, the fact that there was no one in sight to give him direction effected him too because he didnt know where the next refudge was. “There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind. “ From the mans point of view, he probably thought civilization was many more miles away and he probably could not make it that for. The setting effected him by making him probably begin to stress or panic a lot for the most part.
3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. For example he feels dehydrated and tired because he is riding through the desert and has a lack of water. I often feel this way when jogging for extended periods of time. The men in the story “who haven’t left the confines of their porches since Carter was in office” also add to the story. Due to their role, the cyclist takes an unmarked shortcut that turns out to be horrible. The Welch’s factory affects the cyclist because it increases his thirst and causes him to once more think about it. The sign showing grape juice looks irrisistable to him and drives him to keep forward in search of anything to drink. The terrain charge also affects the cyclist because it causes him to have to work ever harder to get up hills now rather than just ride flat terrain.
3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. For example, in paragraph @NUM1 it says, “I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June.” @CAPS1 the heat the cyclist experienced, since he was in a desert in June, made him dehydrate faster. The heat made him drink more so he ran out of water more quickly. Then he would try and conserve water by not drinking and this would cause him to dehydrate more because he was losing body fluid in sweat secondly, in paragraph @NUM2 it says, ”Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills,” These hills affect the cyclist because he would need to use more energy to cycle up the hills. This would cause him to become exhausted more quickly than he would on flat land. If the setting had been different, such as not being in a hilly desert, the cyclist would not have become as dehydrated and tired as he did. In conclusion, the features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways.
2	The features of the setting directly affects the cyclist. “I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June.” This affects the cyclist because in June it is very hot and going through a desert makes it worse, so he would continue to drink water until he has no more. He is also using energy which is making him sweat and drink more water. “One ramshackle shed. Several rusty pipes and a corral that couldn’t hold the lamest mule greeted me.” This could also cause a problem because he can’t renew his water source, which means he has to conserve it, and can’t use as much energy. Both of these things factor into the setting, in a desert with no water, affecting the cyclist more than cycling in a cold day.
6	Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 has come to my attention that people are spending to much time on computers, and I agree because people spend so much time on computers that @CAPS2 gets addicting, people don’t get enough exersize, and eyesite gots worse. So please keep reading my letter and I will tell you the side effects of the computer. Most of all @CAPS2 gets really adicting for a lot of people that they dont spend time with thie familys or sibleings and some kid get so adicted that they come from school and start useing the computer all day and dont study for a test or do home work. Now people spend so much time on the computer that they dont exersize or play sports with thier friends and just sit all day and get lazy and fat just because of the computer. We just need the computer just to chek @CAPS3 and facebook like I do but I just check my facebook and the go play basket ball. One of the biggist problem that I think is when you sit on the computer to long and get a head ache and ruins your ey site. So thank you for reading my letter and hope you agree with me.
2	The cyclist in, “Do not exceed posted speed limit”, was affected greatly by the features of the setting. First of all the weather was extremely hot and hot weather just makes you feel exhausted and like you can’t do anything. Also no one is in sight. She is all alone making her feel small and helpless. I know that when there is no one around I get scared. Finally there is no water around. The author is obviously dieing of thirst and with nothing around her she acts even thirstier.
1	The setting effected the cyclist by the rough roads, the cylist having a hard time pedaling over the roads. The snake, the cyclist got scared of the snake on his ride through the “town.” The fact he was running out of water and the water he found tasted like battery acid. The setting was very rough on the cyclist.
3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist by making him tiered, scared, thirsty and cause him to worry. The setting was a hot California day in June and the cyclist was riding through the heat and over the hills and difficult terrain. The cyclist describes the land when he says, “Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.” He also says, “Over one long, crippling hill.” As the cyclist gets further and further, he has more doubt. Fear and thirst start to get to him. He says, “It didn’t really matter. I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean.” When the cyclist finds the bait shop he has almost lost all hope. On his way to the shop he says, “Slowly gaining elevation while losing hope.” At the end, the setting makes the cyclist regain his strength as he sees the bait shop, when he sees it, he says, “Then, as easily as rounding a bend, my troubles, thirst and fear were all behind me.” The features of the setting put the cyclist in an unsteady ride of fear, hope and confidence
1	The features of the setting affect the cyclist by helping him get water for his thirst. And getting back on the road to go where ever he is trying to go at. But the only thing is that he didn’t never say anything about getting his bait for the fish. Also, cyclist was all so affected because he almost died from thirst and no road.
1	He race trying to get yosemitre for some rushing river
2	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many way. Having desert rahas makes you want to just lay their and not try to go any further, because you don’t know where and end will be. As for grassy, flowery land its more of a sense rout, and makes you want to keep going and see many things. Hills and terrain make it harder to keep going but more of a chalange, and a good workout at the same time, the setting does affect the cyclist.
3	When the cyclist first recieves directions to Yosemite Park from the “old timers” he met, he was pretty confident that they knew what they were talking about. To his dismay, these elderly men sent him through life threatening conditions in a deserted area. As the cyclist begins his journey through the hot, June weather, he “rode into the morning with strong legs and a smile on my face.'' As he continues forward, he notices that there are no buildings, cars, or people of any kind. He passes abandoned towns and creeps into the desert flat land. The flatland however, morphs into crippling hills with tumbleweeds and snakes awaiting. Not only is the terrain suddenly different, but the cyclist is rapidly deteriorating. Tiredness and lack of water make the cyclist think “I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean.'' It was amazing that through all this, the cyclist was able to reach a small fishing camp where he is quickly replenished. “Gary and Wilber’s Fish Camp'' saved the cyclist from almost certain death and him to always just use his map.  
2	In the essay “Rough Road Ahead Do Not Exceed posted Speed Limit.” The feautures of the of the area the cyclists rides through affect him greatly. For example when the narration says, “At some point, humble weeds crossed my path” (Kurmaskie @NUM1). The tone of the cyclists from the quote above shows despare creeping into his mind. Also, another good example is when the narration says, “@CAPS1 hill, a building came into view” (Kurmaskie @NUM1). The cyclist sounds more hopfull than before. That is how the area the cyclist enters affects him.
2	In the story the cyclist is affect by many features of the desert. The main feature is the heat. “I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June.&quot; He’s also running low on water,“The water bottles only contained &amp; few tantalizing sips.” He’s faced by extrem heat and lack of water. He’s tired and has a long way to go. So far, all of the towns have been deserted. Finally he reaches a bait shop and his water and refills his water and promised to stick to the map in the future.
2	In the essay the setting affects the cyclist is different ways. For example, the couse must have been tough because he was dehydrated and it says that there are rolling hills and rough roads. Another example is there were dangerous animals like snakes that he came across. In conclusion, these are some reasons how the setting affects the cyclist.
7	Dear news paper I think computers good for you because you can use the internet and myspace and videos and some school work like math and essays so yes I do think that computers are good for you because you can do all kind of things on computers. And computers can help you with school a lot and you can print out lots of things and why computers can help you is with your math writing spelling and most defyntly is science and ant also literature. The reason why I chose those @NUM1 things is because you can look those @NUM1 things up on. Computer and get the answer to math and spelling right like read @NUM3 helps you write and spell thats one at the reasons why I like computers because I can get on read @NUM3 and I love doing read @NUM3 a lot and I like the read @NUM3 class also because the computers sometimes I like reading on the computers but not all the time but I have to read that's how I'll first learn how to read by forsing my self forward to read. That's how I'll first learned how to read by computers and putting forse to my self. That's why computers is more important to me and look words up.
7	Dear, I strongly believe that computers are great. There are a-lot of great things you can do on the computers. A-lot of people are saying that computers have bad effects on people, like not getting enough exercise and spending time with your family. I do not agree with that because say you have family in a different town, city, or state. There is a website where you can webcam people from all over world with anybody, so that is a good opportunity and also it is free and you can do it at anytime and if you have a laptop, anywhere! My next reason is that you get to see places you have never seen before with direct pictures, like on commercials when our familly wants to go on vaction to a far place and you know nothing about it. You can go on the computer and look up the place and see what it is about and also see what other people said about. Like if it is really hot, or cold, is it a good experience for kids, anything you want, the computer has it. My last reason on why computers are good is because of studying, one thing that always happens is I leave my textbook home. I can go on the computer and see what we had to do. Also you can use the computer to study and learn easier ways to do something for any subject. Survey’s shows that @PERCENT1 of the kids who study on the computer pass there test and get a higher grade percentage +@NUM1. Also if a kid is studying and dosent know what a word is they can I look it up and figure out the definition and how to use it in a sentence. That is why I think computers are a great exercise for your well being and personality.
2	The terrain described in this essay add affect to the strugles of the cyclist. For example when the author says “their were no cars nor buildings in sight” that adds to the affect that he is really out in the middle of nowhere. Also it adds a lot of affect when he comes upon an abandond juice factory and he is so thirsty he puts stones in his mouth to gather saliva. Also when he finally finds water an “oldtimer” asks if he knows the best way to go.
2	In the essay the cyclist is riding in the desert. It is extremely hot out because it’s June and that causes alot of problems for him. He said that since it was so hot he was afaid of getting dihydrated. Also he explains that the roads were getting hilly, which would have caused him to work harder, meaning he was lossing my water.
2	The features of the setting negatively affect the cyclist. When the cyclist arrived at the first “town”, he could tell there’d be some issue. It was a deserted, run down area. The water was hot. Down the road the setting started to change from flat land to hills. There was a big snake in the road. He was becoming very dehydrated going through hilly areas with little to no water.
0	I think it explains because they did good job but it was not good either because they did the right thing but they did same thing worng to.
1	In the essay “Rough Road Ahead : Do Not @CAPS1 Posted Speed Limit,”  by Joe Kurmaskie”  the features of the setting affects the cyclist. Dehydration caused by heat could not enough water caused the cyclist to sweat and to feel nautious. “wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that I could drop from a heatstroke, caused me to laugh. In this quote he is thinking about all the bad and horrible things that could happen to him because he is already in an bad state. In conclusion, this is how the features of the setting affects the cyclist.
3	The features affect the cyclist in a big way. For one the &quot;heat beating down on him made him sweaty, hot and tired. The heat had also made him thirst which led him to drink a lot of water in a little amount of time so he ran out of water before the next town. Also the fact he was in the desert there were no trees to give time off shade that he could rest in. There were also no people around to help him or give him water. So in the ride he struggled more than he thought he could.
2	Some of the things that affect the cyclist was the lack of water. “The water, bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips, water is a big importance. To stort men. Your body need water to work right. The @CAPS1 humid, dry weather of California was a affect To. “The high deserts of California in June.” “l could drop from a heatstroke.” The sun is unbearable, expessary without shade and water, @CAPS2 affect on the cyclist up. The have of animals “ There was No- one in sight.” It would have been a lot easier for the cyclist if store or people would have been around, @CAPS2 exact is the animals. “A @CAPS3 large   snake crossed my path.” “diamondback- blocked the majoritly of the pavement. It would have been to worry about those things these are all things that affect the cyclist.
2	Rolling hills, open terran, hgh deserts-all are features of the setting that affect the cyclist. First, Rolling Hills could take energy out of the cyclist when having to travel for miles on end. The open terrain leads to the beating sun which also puts pressure on the cyclist. Lastly, high deserts would have an affect on the cyclist because he has to pedal for mles on end in rough dry terrain putting strain on him overall.
3	In the case of thr cyclist in the story, “Do Not Exceed Posted speed limit,” the setting has an enormous affecton the biker. Preclaminatly, the weather causes him to feel dehydrated. He says that he “had been nitting my water bottles pretty regularly. “@CAPS1, he tries to get water from the old well, for the demonsrtrating just how much he needed water. The wate in this pump, the owner said, was, “somewhere in the neighbar had of two hundred degrees. If the water has reached such a high temperature, the reader infe that it must be not outside the author implied nthis when he says he is California in June, it is agarsears day, and the sun was beating down. Another aspect of the setting, the lane, dirty, “ghost town” infested land, had a larse affect on the cycle. As he begins to see how hope. He cannot see any signs of madon life; “there was no one is sight, not a building car or structure of any kind. This empty land make the cyclist himself feel empty. Most literally, the fact that the setting was unknown to the cyclist affected his confusion. He didn’t know the best path to his destination and therefore relied on others for aid. Because of this, he ends up lose and acne.
2	There were many different conditions that effected the cyclist. He did not have the proper ammount of water for the journey witch made it difficult. He states in the story, “The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips.” @CAPS1 the terrain and hills made it difficult. He ran into snakes and very deserted country. But his determination led to success and arrived into a town
7	My opinion is that people spend to much time on computers and don’t concentrate on their family. Another reason is that people will not do school work if their to concentrated on the computer. My third reason is people wont enjoy hanging out with there friends. Those are my reasons now let me explain them. First, people will be concentrated on the computer and not their family. They will be focused on the computer way to much and not have fun with there family and friends. People ignore their parents when on computer. I know this because my sister goes on the computer and completely ignores my mom and dad when there talking to her. Please heed my advice or your kids will be ignoring you when you are talking to them. @PERCENT1 of children go on the computer and ignore everything. Now I can advance to the next reason. Second of all, peop concentrate to much on the computer that they dont do homework or any school work. If they dont do homework they could get bad grades on their report cards. If they get bad grades they could fail the marking period and stay back. Please listen or your child could stay back. Now for my third reason. Third, People wont enjoy hanging out with there friends. On the weekends you wouldn't want to be on the computer go out with your friends, enjoy yourself.
3	In the short story “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit”, the features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. When he arrives in the first “town” that the old men told him to go to, the cyclist “chuckled and moved on”, and acted just sort of indifferrenth, to seeing this old town. As he reached “the fork of sorts” twenty miles up the road, &quot;the sight was troubling to him his water supply was somewhat deterriorating, so he became a bit uncered. Finally when the cyclist read the sign that said “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit”, the author continued to move on, but with a large chunk of his confidence gone. He was dehydrated, toned, and had lost a lot of hope after coming across all these places. When he saw the sign for Gary and Wilber’s fish camp, he was as happy as could be, knowing he would drink some water continue his journey the next day, and not listen to old men’s directions again. Many people in stories or in real life are affected by the setting they are in. In the novel @CAPS1 of champions by @PERSON1, one of the characters named @ORGANIZATION1 went on a journey to find an art exhibition, running into many problem's on the way, which in many cases, gave him a lack of hope in reaching his destination safely.
1	Some features can affect the cyclist. The weather can slow them down like if it was cold or hot outside it can slow the person down. If the person does not
1	The features of the setting affect the cyclist by the road that he was on. He was on a road that had snakes and that the trees where all on the road. The road was like a snake cause it was waved and it had a hug hill that made you go fast and it was hard to star dark because the hill was stipped and know one would ride that hill by if it was a rash than it would have been easier to ride the hill cause than there will be more people these would be some people that are these that can help you if you get hurt. There is also no lights there or if you ride at night then you can’t see where you are going un less you put a light on you bike or himilet then you can ride easier the hill at night. That light there is the features of the setting that affects the cyclist that is going down a hill that know one is there that can help you if you need the help you can get it.
2	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because there was a lot of detours and distractions where the cyclist rode. The cyclist had to pay full attention to the road or else the cyclist could have been seriously injured. The features of the setting also affect the cyclist because he has to go down steep hills and windy turns. In conclusion the features of the setting has a huge affect on the cyclist.
1	Setting can affect a cyclsit in many ways. Just as I read in the story, being in a desert dehidrated him. It was hot, the road was bumpy and the dangers of poisnous snakes. The cycclist could have died in many ways such as: heatstroke, falling of his bike, dehidration, and a bite form snake. Say ??? in the mountains of ???.There are many problems that face you there.
2	The features of the setting affected the cyclist by causing him to be hit with his water bottle regularly, the high deserts of California affected him. Also, “Not the miles into the next section of the ride, he noticed a terrain change.” For example flat roads was replaced by short, rolling hills. Then after over coming that, “A large highway sign jumped out at him saying or reading,” “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not exceed Posted Speed Limit. And that was 55. Last the author says, “Sometimes life can feelso cruel. In conclusion there were many things that affected the cyclist.
1	The features of the setting affected the cyclist in many ways. One way is that they would drink up all of there water because it was hot and they would get ??  thirsty from all of that ???
3	In the essay intitled “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not exceed the speed limit” the setting changes as so does the mood of @NUM1 essay as well as the mood of the cyclist. For example towards the begining of the essay, at the reserve the essay states, “At a resevoir campground outside of Lodi, California, I enjoyed the serenity of an early summer evening.” This shows how towards the begining of the essay the cyclist is happy, just woke up and getting reading to go on a nice bike ride; however this all changes when he gets directions from a cople of “old-timers.” From that point on his trip goes down hill and the essay states, “About forty miles in to the pedal, I arrived at the first “town”, a ghost town,” “The sun was beginning to heat down,” This also shows the the setting of a ghost town and a setting with the sun beating down is effecting the mood of the essay and the mood of the cyclist as well as when he goes another @NUM2 miles to a different ghost town with only a few rusty water pumps containing acid flavored water. At this point cyclist is very worried because its hot and he has no water, while knowing he has another @NUM3 miles to go. @NUM3 miles of rolling hills and hot sun shile seeing a “A Rough Road Ahead” sign and a diamondback snake he is sure he is going to die. However it all changes when a different sign, one for a baitshop. This is how the author, Joe Kurmaskie uses the setting to effect the mood.
2	The dusty, dry setting has a serious effect on the cycling author. It got so long and hot that, “…@CAPS1 blues tune ‘summer time’ rattled around in…my deteriorating brain.” The author has spent so long cycling through heat, his brains starting to shut down. It’s also because there is very little water left for him. Another problem is that every building/town except the last building is deserted. So without any chance of being refueled and restocked, it’s the author v.s nature. Plus, as the author states, the directions came from old people who, “…haven’t left their porches since Carter was in office.” The word has greatly changed. Towns have become deserted, buildings rundown but the roads are kept in shape. The towns the old people mentions are now ghost towns, and are no help to the author. 
3	As the cyclist continues on his ride, changes begin to occur in the surroundings, which ultimately affects the cyclist’s attitude. When first starting out on his journey to Yosemite, the cyclist started out that morning, “with strong legs and a smile on my face”. He had received information from a few of the older locals that would help to cut the amount of time it took to arrive at Yosemite National Park. However, as he was riding, the cyclist realized that perhaps the older men’s travel advice was a little out dated. with barely any water left to hydrate himself, and being surrounded by nothing but more road and desert, the cyclist couldn’t help but laugh. “It was a sad, hopeless laugh, mind you, but at least I still had the energy to feel sorry for myself. “At this point, the cyclist was mad at himself for not just using the map that he had brought with him instead of listening to the locals. Although the cyclist remained determined to find water, he had begun to lose hope when he suddenly came across a bait store. Here he was able to rehydrate himself, and with his renewed spirit, continued on his journey, this time using his map.
8	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I am writing a letter to you today because I have herd a complaint that and more people are using computers and getting less exsercise. These experts that are concerned also say people need to enjoy nature, and interact with family and friends more. These experts @MONTH1 be smart but they are wrong. I am going to tell you how they are wrong. My first example is that people that go on the computer alot still exercise. Take twitter as a example. The football player ocho-cinco &quot;tweets&quot; all the time but that doesn't mean he doesn't get exercise. There are plenty of sports players that are on twitter and they are fit. Most of the kids in my grade including me have a facebook. Most of the kids are fit. Just because they are on the computer alot doesn't mean they can't exercise. My second example is the effect of the computer. Students use the computer for a lot of things. We use wikipedia for are projects and research a person. Some schools know a day almost depend on computers. I rember when I lived in country we never had to reely type anything unless it was a project. When I moved to @CAPS3 I am always typing something. Even a rough draft they want me to type. In couentry I would write out my final draft. I have to use the computer. Schools also are teaching us about the computer @CAPS4 as we learn more and more things on the computer we are on the computer more and more. When someone. Finds out a new website there going to tell there friends and there going to pass it on and @CAPS4 on. My third example is how the experts say that people are spending to much time on the computer and less time interacting with family and friends. My grandpa, aunt, other family members have a facebook account. That means I can still interact with family and friends. The people that are the computer alot that are adults probably don't have family over every night and probably go out with friends evey once in a while. Computers also benefit Society for buisness people they might have to a powerpoint and they have a computer. When experts say we need to enjoy nature, interact with family and friends, and do more excising they might be right but we can do all these things but we can also still go on the computers. If you take a survey in @CAPS3 to see how many people are on the computer almost everyday and then you ask them how many of them exercise you would see that you can do both.
1	The cyclist was riding on a rough bumby dangerous road. He had to be on the look out for animals that might try and nort or even kill him. Since he had no water he was de hydrating. Also the road was hot very well taken care of it took more energy to get through it.
1	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because it just looks like he is on the highway as in the desert riding his motorcycle or bike and it does look like hes coming or going on a vacation and because of the way hes riding it it seems hes going real fast as about to fall.
1	The cyclist is out in the desert there for was tired &amp; also running out of water so hes getting dehydrated. 
3	The setting of the story affected the cyclist by changing his mood. At the strat he had can eidance which died once he got into the barren dessert but picked up when  he round a rest stop. A prime example to how he started leds and a smile on my face “to” and the growing realization that I could dropping heartstroke on a gorgeous day in June becaused listen to some gentelmen who hadn’t been off their perch in decades “ to” I had an over welming urse to seek out Gary and wilber kiss them and buy some bait. “ The over all mood ox the story is based off how the authour feels.
2	The features of the setting in this story, “Do not exceed Posted Speed limit,” affect the cyclist in a huge way. The cyclist was biking through California in a desert-like area. It can get very hot there,like the writer describes, “wide rings of sweat circled my shirt.” The fact that the area he was biking through, and that he out of water put himself into serious danger. Also, since the cyclist had no water he was becoming dehydrated. The area he was biking through had barely any people. This means there was no water available for him. Therefore, if the setting had taken place in a cooler setting with lots of people, the cyclist would have found water. Without this type of setting, the story would have completely changed.  
2	The setting very much affects the cyclist. “I maneuvered down the hill.” This statement shows him going down the hill. If the hill wasnt there then it would hawe been a whole lot easier for him to get to where he was going, also he would have had more energy. If there werent anyhills to get in his way.
2	The setting in this story was hot and filled with rolling hills. These factors greatly effected the cyclist. The hot weather was bad for the cyclist because he had a limited water supply.The text says, “The sun was beginning to beat down” (@NUM1). Showing the temperature was rising.  The text says, &quot;Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills&quot; (@NUM2). The author’s battery was leaking acid so it was harder to make it over the hills. Seems like everything went wrong for this man but he still made it.
1	In the start story “Do not exceed speed limit,” time of year and place setting were the main things that affected the cyclist. This story takes place in the deserts of california in June. The fact that the story took place in June (and especially in a California desert) really is what caused the cyclist’s dehydration. Anywhere in this country, June is summer, and summer means that it gets hotter and more humid than usual. This heat cause the dehydration and the &quot;growing realization that I (the author)
2	The settings in the story affected the cyclist throughout the story with winding roads and hills peddling can already be tough, tiring, and challenging, with the rider having little to know way or the roads were ten times harder to deal with. And with no landmarks or places insight its hard to have confidence because theire is nothing to keep going for.
1	Don’t let anything stop you with your goals. Going to Yosemite National Park. Takes a status that would out home off side. Forty miles into the trys comes to a town. Got to a water station and get nothing because old men say “the water taste like buttery acid. Lead going to hills and azyl towns, @CAPS1 can be rod without anything to drink. People die  from heatatacks because they don’t  sits and take herats for water and food.
10	Today more than @PERCENT1 of our population spends expensive amounts of time each day on the computer. I agree that having a computer in your home is benficial at time, but to me the disadvantages outway the advantages of spending to much time on a computer. Disadvantages such as cyber bullying, illegal websites, the criminals that use the internet to target days, and the interference that spending to much time on the computer has with your grades and other school work. I think that largest number of people affected by spending to much time on the computer are kids. Mostly kids right name from school, drop there backpack, and instead of sitting at the kitchen table or study area to do homework, they sit right down in front of the computer. Then what happens to that homework? It usually doesnt get done. That absence of homework could make an enourmous decline on a students average. However, homework is not the only school work effected by the computer. Even in school kids use internet on their cell phones. This provides a huge distraction for kids and usually ends up with the result of kids not completing the task asigned to them. Not getting work done is not the problem. Computer presents to kids through. It also helps with bullying; cyber bullying. Alot of kids are bullied and picked on the school but then that bullying carries itself to the childs home threw the computer. Once at home a kid can get hurtful emails or instant messages. These hurtful messages @MONTH1 do a lot more than just hurt someone feelings, it can hurt their self asteem and how they feel about themselves. Then as if cyber bullying and not doing homework werent bad enough. there are also criminals on the computer. These criminals prey on kids. They can find passwords to accounts. They can find out personal information about yoo because of how much time on the computer each day. Once they find out enough about you they use to it gain your trust and the problem only escalades from there. Although many kids are affected by the amount of time they spend on the computer each day, there not the only ones. Adults are affected just as much and just as easily. One thing that lvers adults in to spending all their time on the computer is all the &quot;great deals&quot; they can find on the computer. But many of these great deals come from fake or illegal websites. Websites that are selling stolen merchandise. Then show you all the benefits from buying from them and then once you believe them and buy what they are selling, they have all of your personal information. From their you can end up with an empty bank account or even identity theft. Does that realy sound a &quot;great deal?&quot; @CAPS1 to me the disadvantages of having a computer definetly out way the advantages of having a computer. I think that people need to step away from the computer desk, get good grades, avoid bullying and criminals. Keep there bank acounts full and there identity safe. Instead they should spend time outdoors, with family: or enjoying life!
1	Features in the setting of the cyclist does in fact affect him in many ways. The setting in the passage include features like, no one to be seen, no buildings, dirty, bumpsy terrain, hot weather and plenty of vegetation. All these features affect the cyclist in negative ways. For instance, the dry weather affects the human body with dehydration which the cyclist is affected by.
1	The setting in the story affect the cyclist alot. It is June in the California desert. The sun is heating down on him. Another problem that he faces is that there is a very rough terrain. All of this together makes him drink up his water even faster. The setting is making him feel very disprate when is even worse.
3	Each person has a really good ability that stands out. Someone can be good looking, smart or confident. Someone @MONTH1 never give up and do what he wishes to do. The cyclist in the story is or man with a strong will. He wants to be alive. He saw too many difficult in his way to get the place he wanted to be. He listened to some old guys and he lost his way. The sun was beginning to beat down. He was out of water but he continued riding to reach his goal. He was losing his strength. The weather  was @NUM1’@CAPS1.The  water  tasted  like  acid battery. He  believed  himself  that he can be alive. He got stronger by believing in himself eventhough he was losing strength. Every place that he passed by was a new experienced for life. They were like a game that he came successful. He never give up. He did everything he could do to not losing his mind. He didn’t want lose the battle in his mind.   
2	The features of the setting made the cyclist more tired and thirsty. The rolling hills where he had to pedal up and down and the desert with no water in sight just dry land. Everything in the setting was increasing the conflict in his story. The old Welch’s Grape Juice Factory,is like drinks are right there but are now gone. If it would have been Yosemite with cool pines and rivers he would’ve felt completely different. No people in sight lacked security and water, also no buildings. The tumble weeds gave you no hope of getting any where and the snakes and vultures just eating you after you died. Everything in the story was the opposite of what he wanted until he got to his last hope the bait shop.
2	In the story “Rough Road Ahead; Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” the setting of the story majorly affected the cyclist. The story tells us “…I was travelling through the high deserts of California  in June.” The extreme heat of the summer definitely put a  strain on the cyclist causing him to have to drink lots of water . Unfortonatly the  “towns” were very far apart and many not having good water making dehydration  problem. “There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or a structure of any kind.” @CAPS1 of this would have happened had he been cycling at a marathon with people handing him water when requested, or if he had been smart enough to follow a good map.
1	The features of the setting affected the cyclist. For example, on page @NUM1, Kurmaskie said “ I got down on my hands working the hande of the rusted water pump with all my strength” that shows desperation due to the lack of water.
2	The features of the setting been amajor affect of this cyclist  in the  story. On the normal road, the ground is smooth but think is a lot like and winding. The cyclist also comes across bumps, non-paved roads that make it hard to meneuver through. Then you add the fact that there is not really any towns and he is a blazing heat with little water. The setting of this passage played a key role in the story.         
2	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because he is in the high deserts of California where it is very hot so, you need alot of water. Then he needs more water and finds a water pump but cant use the water because it was “some where in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees.&quot; Then the terrain in changes when he says “Flat road was replaced 
1	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because I was talking about the exceed posted speed limit. How the speed limit or were it says “Never accept travel advice from a collection of old-timers who haven’t left the confines of their porches since Carter was in office. They are trying to say is that, you do what they say you are going to be mesem peoples travel will not work, so make the right choice and do the right thing.
1	The features of the setting affect the cyclist by that he or she should behave act or talk according to the settings. It means that where ever they are existing and whatever it looks like, they need to fit them self in. They also need to fit the mood according to where they are located. The cyclist is feeling comfortable according to the story and he dosent need any change in setting or location. For conclusion the features of the setting affects the cyclist by that he needs to make improvment and changes according to where he or she is located. 
8	Dear @CAPS1, I believe that computers can be a very good thing to implement in society. First of all, if people never used computers they would miss out on an immense opportunity to learn about the world around them. Also, with computers, people can communicate with people from across the world. If people use computers more often they'll probably develop the skills to pursue job opportunities on a much wider market. Because of this computers can greatly help any community. Computers can give many chances for exploring education. People can pursue a large amount of information with a relatively small space as opposed to using a large area of books. People can find alsmot anything they want to know about on the internet relatively easily. If not for solely learning but for reference. If someone is making a project at a school. Computers can expand on many peoples opportunities for education. Secondly, the internet can be used as a widespread communication tool. Any document or piece of information can be transmitted from say, @LOCATION2 to @LOCATION1 @CAPS2.C in a matter of seconds. Simialarly if two people are seperated by a large distance, they can easily communicate since the invention of social networking, people that @MONTH1 have lost touch can easily meet again and discuss things. With computers communication is becoming faster and faster. Finally, because of an over-expanding job market, use of computers is becoming a common requirement of many professions. Most jobs that pertain to engineering require use of different programs for modeling and drafting. Also now most governments are networked with files on computers. Also, most any job that has to do with any sort of business has a requirement for the person needed to be able to type quickly. Because many jobs require experience with computers they shouls be a part of any community. In conclusion experience with computers can benefit any one person and entire society all together.
1	In the beginning the cyclist was ready to go and happy. By the time he got half way there he was “losing hope”. It was very hot and he was simple alone. By the end, he was relieved because not only did he find water, he found an easier way to get to Yosemite. The first old group of men didn’t help, but the second man did.
3	In the story “Do not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,&quot; the features of the setting affect the cyclist, it say this because the cyclist enables us of what is going around him and he feels about it. It says, “one ramshack shed, several rusty pumps and a coral that couldn’t hold the lamest mule greated me. The author goes on to say that it troubled him. Actually that made the author scared that maybe he was all alone in the desert with ghost town. The unplanned that the roads were rusty where the speed limit was 55 mph since he barely had any water he was going 12 mph. This tells me, he’s troubled and confused about the surrounding ways, because it all desert seem light it became the author is slowly loosing hope on the travels further and further. I think it’s the same week people that as soon as trouble comes; or looks like it’s among they start losing hope and their better judgment, and life seems a lot harder.
1	In this story it seems as if everything is dry. The rider would be getting real thirsty. He is all by himself that would make any man feel strong, because if you have an ascedent that nobody would be there to help. Hes going up and down steep hills so he would have to be careful.
2	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. For instance, If you were cycling in a very cold climate you wouldn’t sweat as much and wouldn’t need to drink as much water, but in the story the cyclist is in a very hot climate and he runs out of water, “The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sps,wide cings of sweat circled my shirt and the growing realizating that I could drop from heat stroke on a gorgeous day in June…” This quote explains that the setting of the cycling plays a huge role in the cyclist. Also, the terrain can affect biker. If one was to ride on a flat terrain is gonna put much wear…and tear on the cyclists body therefore the flat terrain would be easier. All of those reasons explains that the settings affect the cyclist in many  ways.
3	The setting plays an important part in the authors mood. When the author finds the dilapidated ghost town, he is still high spirited and amused. He thinks that it is a little funny that the old men’s “town” was now abandoned. “…(the town) fit the traditional definition of a ghost town. I chuckled…” This shows that the author is still in good spirits because he can still laugh. When “a tar like substance  oozed out of the water pump at the next stop the author became a little unsettled, as the author was running low on water. But he was still optomistic. Once the rolling expansive hills came into view, the author  let out a “sad, hopeless laugh.” The author was depressed , dehydrated and had all but given up , however he kept going and eventually made it to some water.
3	In the passage “Rough Road Ahead Do Not Exceed Speed Limit” the setting must definetly affects the cyclist. When the cyclist comes for the first abandured “town” he searches for water but finds only that which tastes like battery acid “when I tried a drop or two, it had the flavor of battery acid.” The makes his dehydration seem much worse because of the fact that he has water it is just undrinkable. The rough road ahead there gives the feeling of determination because when the cyclist in on his last legs he must work even harder to get water a flat road was replaced by short rolling hills,” this quote shows that despite his condition the cyclist most perservere. Also quote “tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridicuosly large snake –“tumble weeds and snakes give the feeling of desolation and of being alone, which is what the cyclist is this point. The setting of this story directly correalates with how the cyclist is feeling.
3	The hot day in June riding a bike in the desert. The cyclist rode off into the sun on his way to Yosemite National Park. The old men told him where to go on the map even though they had not been through that way in years. When the cyclist started his day off ready to go. He thought he would be able to stop and get water regulary but as he found out he was in the middle of the desert with no water around. The man pushed himself and stopped thinking about water. He even put pebbles in his mouth to suck on so he would be able to keep his mind off water. The man was very smart in this situation and knew what to do. This experence has made him stronger.
2	FLAT ROADS, HILLS, BUILDING - ALL ARE SETTINGS THAT AFFECTED THE CYCLIST. WHILE THE HILLS WERE FLAT THE CYCLIST WAS DETERMINED HE COULD MAKE IT AND WASN’T GOING TO GIVE UP ON HIMSELF. WHEN THE HILLS GOT BIGGER AND HARDER TO PEDAI, HE BEGAN TO GET EXHAUSTED AND TIRED. LASTLY, THE BUILDINGS WERE WHAT MADE HIM WANT TO GIVE UP. WHEN HE SEES THE BUILDING OF THE WELCH’S GRAPE JUICE FACTORY AND THE YOUNG BOY DRINKING HE “HUNG HIS HEAD.” HE WAS GETTING MORE TIRED AS HE WENT ALONG. THE LAND WAS MAKING HIM FEEL AS IF HE DIDN’T WANT TO KEEP MOVING ALONG.
2	The setting affected the cyclist greatly. He had no water and he was “traveling through the high deserts of California in June.” The deserts and no water could have been life-or-death to him, making him stressed and thirsty. Couple that with him biking, and you have yourself a dehydrated man in the desert! When he was between the “ghost town” and bait shop he says, “There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind, This would make the cyclist think that there is no hope for his survival if he passed out. The deserts of California affects any cyclist greatly especially one without water like the cyclist in the story. 
0	It think  it means  to be all you can be.
8	The computer effects peoplelife by taking them away from their family and have is @NUM1 reasons why the computer effect the people lives. @NUM2) They do not know what is happening outside. @NUM3) Their family @NUM1). Their job. Please listen to my reason why the computer effect people lives! My first reason their they don't know what happening out ide because they are to much busy on the computer. Their friends could of won something important and they wanted you to be their but no they are just so busy on the computer. They are going to miss out of nature or hanging out with friends. Like if they are meeting one at a place and they said they if just means they were on the computer all day long. My second reason is theie family. I said their family because they could miss out on a lot of things. Such as a family reunion, a family vacation and many more. It like if one of their family members hurt and they are trying to call you but you dont picking up the phone because you to busy on the computer to pick it up. You can lose your wife cause the computer because you forgot her birthday, her and her because you are on the stupid computer. About their kids, what happens if they want to playing they have nothing also to do card their? Say no cause you computer. They family will get rewing. My third and last reason is their job. They can lose their job cause your missed work cause your on the computer for doing nothing work cause computer. If they lose their jobs they can pay for they can't use their computer. They are going to be in their house with no light and no computer cause they have on it to much and did not pay attention was happening. They akk to feel like they are going to cause they dont have their computer. Or the computer shot doen and he cant enough money to get a electriction. Those were all ny reasons. @NUM2) they don't know what is happening outside. @NUM3) their family @NUM1) Their job. Thank you for listening to my reasons.
2	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because of how hot it is, how big the hill is and the shortage of cold water. For example it is so hot that the cyclist does not think he is going to make it. Also all he could do was a water depleting @NUM1. Also the hills became so big he crested the first couple until the sign jumped out saying rough road ahead: do not exceed posted speed limit. Lastly he had some rough terrain to ride over and no water he was at a dehydrated state and he could only do a water depleting @NUM1 when the speed limit was @NUM3. 
1	The features of the setting affect the cyclist by causing him to become dehidrated and start to lose conciousness. For ex. the town he was suposed to comue to was just an abandoned factory and he had to travlle another @NUM1 miles or so with no water.
1	The humid climate and hot weather will want to make you keep over if you don’t have water in your possesion. Like near the end of the essay the person sucked on stones to try retain water better which never heard about it its time. This weather is the cause of the character ??? dihydration which is a symptom of lack of water in the body.
1	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because in paragraph @NUM1 it say that the temperture was was getting high and that when he drank the water that it test like battery acid. This would affect him because it it was so hot and the water was starting to get hot how would he be able to get through the day with out pasing out also in paragraph @NUM2 it say the roads changed to hill when you ride up and down the hills you become tired from pumping you legs then you would feel hot and tiredd and would not want to ride the bike. That how the features of the setting affect the cyclist.
2	The cyclist in the story is @CAPS1 affected by the fatause of setting in the story. The Hill afected him becaus they have harder to get over.
3	The features of the setting, or environment, in which the cyclist is in greatly affects him. First of all, after leaving the campground with directions from the older gentlemen, he enters an area that is greatly isolated. In paragraph @NUM1, he wrote, &quot;This place might have been a thriving little spot at one time but on @TIME1, it fit the traditonal definition of a ghost town. &quot;This state of being alone later affected the cyclist because his increasing dehydration was becoming dangerous; if he were to collapse, he would most likely die. This drove the cyclist to continue on in order to survive. Another aspect that affected him was the extremely hot temperature. In paragraph, he implies the weather is hot by telling the reader he is traveling through to California desert in June. The heat gives the cyclist another obstacle to overcome in his struggling to get to the next town for water. Lastly in paragraph @NUM2, he mention the terrain changes to gently rolling hills. This shows the physical and metaphorical obstacles must get over the heat and isolation, but must also find the mental drive and determination to carry on. 
1	The setting affect the cyclist in alot of ways one way is that if you dont know where your going you could get hurt. Also is if the road condition are very bad. That is how the setting affected the cyclist.
2	In this essay features of the setting affect the cyclist in his journey to get to Yosemite makes it worse. Firts for example the cyclist was in the high deserts of California in the heat of June. Which makes it bad because of the heat makes it harder on the cyclist. Also being in the deserts there wasn’t any watwer supply so after the cyclist ran out of water it got worse because he got dyhigerated, and caused him to become weaker and not pedal as fast. Also the author says that the tarren changes from flat roads, to short rolling hills, which also made it more difficult because the short hills made it more work, and since it was so hot and he didn’t have water he couldn’t funcation as well as if he was hydrated.
1	The features in the setting of this story affect the cyclist very much so. Throughout this story this poor person has to get lost and end up in the middle of nowhere. By her being out her cycle was being affected. She was just trying to get somewhere and get things done, but of course she didn’t. She kept moving on down. This story was very good and showed that she cared and wanted it bad.
2	In this story, the cyclist had to ride threw the desert, during june and with little water. I would say that this has a big effect on the cyclist since he dehydrates alot and is threatened with heatstroke. Also he had to ride careful past a huge snake which could have hurt him. Personally I don’t know what he was doing ride threw the dessert by himself, and that’s his problem.
9	Today in our society almost everyone uses computers weather @CAPS4 to do research, play games, or interact with others. These are all positive things. The schools across america are using computers from @NUM1 grade to online colledges. People benefit from computers by getting everything and anything done from them. @CAPS2 anyone who has a brain can relize that computers are a positive in todays society. First off computers are a positive thing because they can get almost anything done for you. you can play on them, and interact with others the reason that the computer being able to get almost anything done for you @CAPS4 a good thing because if you need to get work done you can do that if you need research @CAPS1 can do that and @CAPS1 can help you In any subject. The reasons that playing games can be positive @CAPS4 @CAPS1 does not only give you great hand eye cordonation but @CAPS1 also exersises you brain and can be a learning for young children. The reasons that interacting through the computer @CAPS4 that you learn how to be and talk through email for buisnesses and,make many @CAPS2 pleases use your brain and that computer our society today. @CAPS2 to keep on going americans are the smartest people in this world and our very well. I @CAPS3 have to you like and that @CAPS4 why we send every one of them to school @NUM2 of every year. Will that said they use computers anyone to say that computers are bad the that you love do while this. That useing computers and benifiting your life. @CAPS2 as you can see that computers are a thing for the good and can benifit to days saciety @CAPS2 I beg you for your sake please use computers and benifit your life. Its for your own good.
2	In the @CAPS1 &quot;Do not Exceed Posted Speed limit&quot; many ways affect the cyclist. Three of those things are heat, lack of water, mud its anything town. The heat affects him because he gets extremely hot and tired. For example the text states.&quot; I could die form a heatstroke on a gergeous day in June.&quot; this shows that it was extremly hot. The cyclist had a lack of water and was very thirsty. For example it states in the text.&quot; I eased past, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state.&quot; This shows that he was very thirsty from lack of water. The last way the setting affects the cyclist is when he goes into a town and tieds it empty. The text states,&quot; on that morning it fit the traditional detinition at a ghost town.&quot; This show that he expected it to be there so he could rest but it wasn't like it was appare to be things all show how the setting affected th cyclist.
2	The features of the setting effect the cyclist in a couple of ways. The first and main way was that he was riding through the dessert. This caused him to sweat badly and get very dehydrated. The seconded way was that there were rough roads and hilly snotts this made him more tired faster. In conclusion the setting did not help him not one little bit.
3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. The cyclist should had looked at his map instead of taking the old man advise because all the information was on the map. He almost died because he listened to the old men and didn’t look at his map. If the cyclist was in a car mabey he would have better luck because he would be going  faster than the @NUM1 bike.
3	Many things on the cyclist journey affected him. It was in the middle of summer in California. The heat is unbeleivable and rediculously hot. “… I could drop from heatstroke…” he was so bad overheated and dyhdrated that he could of died any minute. He could have also been killed by a giant snake. “…look like a diamondback- blocked the majority of the pavement…” It could have easily killed him, if he wasn’t careful. But with his determination and spite he pulled threw and made it to a fresh supply of water. If he would have gaven up his life would have been over.
1	When the cyclist went to ask about the road the old men told him all its good way that he should go. But the old man hasn’t seen the land in a really long time. The man don’t long that the land has changed. So when the cyclist went back to ride the roads and everything ends ?? the cyclist didn’t know what to do.  
2	There are many reasons how the features of the setting affect the cyclist. There are ways mentally and physically. The ways mentally is that the cyclists can loose determination and pride if they cannot fight the journey of cycling. The ways physically is the setting is hot and rough and the cyclist would have lack of water and food supplies. Those were the ways how cyclist would be affected by the features of the setting both mentally and physically. 
2	The cyclist in ”Rough road Ahead” was riding his bike in the middle of June, and in California. Both are very bad if you are lost and on a bike. This is because in June it usually hot, and I know in @CAPS1 it’s usually always hot, The cyclist is on a bike this means he has to pedde everywhere he goes. This is not along going to use up all his energy but also make him hot, And when your this hot you need to keep hydrated. But your lost so if you use all your water before you find safty then your in major trouble. Also In California theres like Hills, and mountains and stoff and peddling up a mountain isn’t an easy trick.
1	The features of the cyclist affect him in many ways. One way that the features affected him was that when he ran out of water all the buildings were like a ghost town. He said that there was no one in sight. In the story it says “the bulding abandoned years earlier.” If I was him I would of turned around and went back so I would take the chance of not dieing out in the middle of an abandoned area.
2	The setting is the main factor on effects on the cycleist. The cycleist’s main problem is that he is low on water &amp; dehydrated, “trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state.” The author wouldn’t have been so dehydrated if it weren’t so hot. Also, all the problems he faces are setting related like the snake &amp; the rough road. If it would have taken place in a more mild area, there wouldn’t have been any conflicts.
1	In the story the cyclist is afected by setting because in the @NUM1 paragraph it talks about him seeing the old water pump and how he was trying to get water out. At the end of the story he gets angry when he sees the old welches juice factory because he relizes that the old men didn’t know what they were talking about. Also at the end he is realived when he finds Gary and @ORGANIZATION1 because there is water there. 
11	Dear @LOCATION1, I believe that computers benifit the society. Computers help use in many ways but the @NUM1 main reasons are they help us store important documents get better at or learn forein language and get information. So without further adue here is more extensive reasonings. First of all, computers help us store many documents without computers companies that involve autioning and many other thing would have to store everything in filing cabinets. That would take forever and there wouldn't be enough room, so a lot of files would @CAPS1 be laying around every where @CAPS1 think about it. You use computers to make store send your newpaper articles and without computers you wouldn't be able to keep everybody up to date. Secondly they help use learn on get better at forien languages. Computers help use learn what other people are saying in other countries around the world. Like I have grandmother she the learned spanish. Now I can talk to her and she can understand me. Finally computers help use get information. They help us get information for a project at school, records direction, etc. In the year @DATE1 people din't have computers but when the first router was made the people I went up @NUM2 points. Farmers became slaves became very rich and I kid even grad collage at age @NUM3. So before you say people are spending too much fine on their computers and less time exercising, enjoying nature and interacting with family and friends think about what computers do for us @CAPS1 think. So furher more computers benifit us a lot. There's storing deviced helping us get better a lot learning a forign language and getting information. So please make te right chose and think about what computers do for us. 
2	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in “Rough Road Ahead” by Joe Kurmaskie in a very profound way. While he is riding, he sees surrounding him” no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind.” When he realizes his solitude when he is in a state of almost dehydration, he despairs. As a result of the seclution of the setting, having only seen “One ramshackle shed in many miles, the cyclist almost looses hope. However, hope is renewed when he thinks of “the cool pines and rushing rivers of @CAPS1.” That is how the cyclist is affected by his setting, and despair is turned to hope.
1	The setting affects the cyclist because it’s very hot outside and he is starting to loose energy. The setting affects how fast he rides when he stops or when he drinks or eats. all of these depend on the type of weather he is riding in. like in the story it was so hot out when he saw a building he wiped the sweat from his face to make sure it wasn’t a mirage.
3	In the essay “Do not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” The features of the setting had a great affect on the hard-working cyclist. The weather land and surrounding objects really determined the cyclists mood and ability. One example would be the statement, “cool pines, rushing rivers of upsemite had my name written all over them.”The refreshing nature and cool air made the cyclist feel confident energized and ready. Another example would be the quote, “One ramshackleshed, several rusty pumps, and a corral that couldn’t hold in the lamest Mule greet me.”there, the cyclist feels troubled and alittle curious as to what lay ahead this water wasn't not the best and he was worried. The last example was, “flat road was replaced by short rolling hills...tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake.” there, the cyclist tries to stay focused through distractions. It is deserted and he feels dehydrated as well. As his route ends he comes across in manymore aspects of the setting which create a different feeling or ability. Therefore the nature of where his bike passed, and the things he saw affected his choices and ability.
2	There are many features in the setting that affect the cycleist, one of which is that he is in the middle of California riding his bike in the sun with a limited ammount of water. It affects the cyclist because he almost collapses from heatstroke and lack of water. That is how the features of the setting affect the cyclist.
2	The features of the setting in this essay affected the cyclist in many ways. “One ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a corral that couldn’t hold in the lamest mule greeted me.” (Kurmaskie @NUM1). The cyclist was expecting a small town with people in it and some type of good water supply. However he instead found a deserted ghost town with only a rusty pump that didn’t even supply water. It made the cyclist feel depressed because he was running low on water and could easily dehydrate without it. “The speed limit was @NUM2. I was doing a water-depleting @NUM3. sometimes life can feel so cruel.” (Kurmaskie @NUM4). The cyclist is possibly being passed by cars on the highway going @NUM2 while he is only going @NUM3.This probably makes him feel as if he is getting no where at all. It would be all the more reason for him to give up. But he keeps trying to reach his destination. The feeling of being passed by the cars makes him determined to continue and finish his journey.
1	The cyclist had very little water. It was very hot. He had a long way to go. The road was very bumpy so he couldn’t go to fast or he’s tire’s might bust. There were know cars in site so if he did break down it would have taken even longer.
3	The setting effects the cyclist in many ways. And following old timers advice wasn't too smart of him. In that essay he was headed to the Yosemite National Park, he had a map to follow and he trusted himself, he a cyclist he knows his way around. But came around a couple of men who told him a shortcut. He trusted them which he shouldn't have and he was on his way. The setting was rough. He was riding through a California desert; which was probably way too not, and he was looking water. The only thing that he found tasted live battery and so that no good for him. It was a flat land, than rolling hills. The next town would have been in the @NUM1 miles. This cyclist was hilling himself. While riding along these lands there was more in sight, and no building or cars it was line a dead road. Those old men had him through neck and been, once he made it to the next town he knew with those conditions
2	On the cyclist way to Yosemite National Park, he is given directions from a group of old men, but their direction aren’t so good. The desserted place affected him because there was no where for him to stop and eat or refill his water bottle “There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind”. There were rusted water pump’s, with hot water, but nothing to cool him down. His surroundings led him to the state of dehydration.
3	The features of the setting including vast emptiness, hills, heat, and no water all create obstacles for the cyclist in “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit.” @CAPS1 to the vast emptiness of the area in which he was traveling he could not stop somewhere to ask for help or to take a rest. Also there were no other travelers so he could not ask for assistance from them. Another obstacle during his trip are the hills. It takes more energy to pedal up hill so he ends up tiring easily and taking longer than expected. There is also extreme heat which causes him to sweat and even become even more thirsty. So he ends up running out of water. In the story he writes, “The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips.” He is now becoming thirsty and if he doesn’t find water he @MONTH1 dehydrate. He searches for a place to rest where there @MONTH1 be water but he is not able to. All of these obstacles cause the cyclist to become devastated and give up hope but he continues his travel and eventually finds a place to rest. All of these obstacles tying into another.
0	I really thought the story didn’t make sense the setting was crazy I really wasn’t feeling it at all I don’t think it was even a good story
6	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3, I think computers make a big role in monern cicity. For this reason I think that @CAPS4 should take the advantige that @CAPS4 have. @CAPS4 could do lots of things. @CAPS4 could use it for @CAPS7 related @CAPS6 @CAPS4 could use it for @CAPS5 @CAPS6. @CAPS4 could also chat online. @CAPS4 could use it for @CAPS7 related @CAPS6. Like homewrok and projects. @CAPS4 could use it for info on a project or homework. @CAPS4 could use it for the @CAPS8, @CAPS9, and @CAPS10. and many other reasons why @CAPS4 should have @CAPS12 for @CAPS7. @CAPS4 could use the computers for @CAPS5 @CAPS6. Like making holiday and birthday cards. Pay bills for morgiges online. @CAPS4 could book a hotel online. @CAPS4 could play on or agentst with online games. @CAPS4 use for bidding on ebay or amazon. Pay bills for long distance calling. @ORGANIZATION1 the @CAPS13 if you missed it. Or just @ORGANIZATION1 shows in general. @CAPS4 could use it for chatting online. Like sendding emails or talking on ooVoo. So thats why @CAPS4 sould take the advantige.
2	The features of the setting affect a cyclist in many ways. If you have a bumpy ride, then the cyclist will have a harder time. also, if it is really hilly, then it is harder and will take longer too. “Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills,” It will take him longer to reach his destination. animals in the setting can also be effective.” and a ridiculously, large snake-it really did look like a diamondback-blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me.” animals can get in the way like this snake did for the cyclist. If a squirrel or some kind of animal was to run across the rode right infront of you, it could scare you and you could clash. Sometimes trees make it cooler because you don’t have to sun beating directly down on your back. If there is a fresh water stream you can stop and wash all the sweat off of you and get a drink. The setting in which is cyclist is riding, can help or hurt the cyclist.
1	It affected him by dehydrating him and wearing him down to the point where he was about to give up. But he never gave up. As the end sartisfaction came out of it all.
1	The trees were in the landscape and it was making the colors red and the volcanoes and the tall pine trees covered were in the landscape and milker years ago it make the swampland became the desert
3	There were a few features in the setting that affected the cyclist. One very important feature is that the cyclist was in the desert. This is demonstrated by the statement “I was travelling through the high deserts of California.” not only was the cyclist in the desert, he was there in June, one of the hottest months of the year. It is demonstrated that he was there in June reading to the statement “I was travelling in June.” @CAPS1 there at that time made dehydration a bigger risk. It was also very hot there. We know this because when he was at the water pump, he stated, “blackish water feeling somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees.” From this, we can affirm that not only was at hot, the water was dirty. The water also “had the flavor of battery acid.” This was bad for the cyclist who was running low on water because he “had been hitting (his) water bottles pretty regularly.” The fact that he had little water left is demonstrated in the statement, “The water bottle contained only a few tantalizing sips.” The cyclist was in a bad situation. These had ganged-up against him in his trip. These features are the desert, the high temperatures, and the blackish water which tasted like battery acid. The fact that he was low on water made it harder to fight these features with water, he would battle the desert, high temperatures, and have no need to pump bad water. Again, the features of the setting that affected the cyclist are the desert, the high temperatures, and the bad water which he could not drink.
3	In the story “Rough Road Ahead” the cyclist was excited and determined to get to Yosemite National Park. The cyclist had to be thinking of the beautiful waters with “His name written over them”. The rough terrain and harsh weather took its affection on the unaware cyclist. The sun, beat down on the cyclist back, he tried to ignore it, but soon the heat made him frequently drink his water away to sips to drink. The cyclist was told by the old man a town was only @NUM1 miles aways. The town was the traditional definition of a ghost town. “That probably gave the cyclist no hope for surviving of finding anyone to help him reach his destination. The conditions of the roads, the lack of water which made him see a mirage, made the cyclist not trust the words of an old man who had led him to the abandon locations he had seen. The cyclist was affected by the settings in a bad way but in the end was given a little help from a traditional map.
3	In the essay, “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” by Joe Kurmaskie, the features of the setting affected the cyclist because it made it more difficult for the cyclist to survive and make it through his journey. In the essay, it says, “I arrived at the first “Town”…this place might have been a thriving little spot at one time…but on that morning it fit the traditional definition of a ghost @NUM1). In the essay, the cyclist takes directions from a few old men to get to Yosemite National Park. The cyclist has a limited amount of water, and it was a very humid day for traveling. Because of the humidity, the cyclist nearly ran out of water when he had to cycle up, “short, rolling hills” (@NUM2) in the hot weather. Had the town been thriving, he could have bought more water to make his trip easier to accomplish. Also, if the road in the story would have been flat, he cyclist wouldn’t have gotten as tired as he did and needed more water. It would have been less strainful on the cyclist to pedal on a flat road rather than a hilly road. The challenges facing the cyclist remined me of that of the main character of the movie @PERSON2. In this movie, the main character must make his way through the extreme conditions of the desert, just like the cyclist had to in order to reach his destination. In conclusion, the setting clearly affects the cyclist’s journey in a negative way.
2	In the story, “Rough Road Ahead”, by Joe Kurmaskie, the cyclist was affected by the setting. The cyclist has said that he had to ride over terrain that was smooth at first but then turned into rolling hills. He also had to find his way around a big snake while being dehydrated. The cyclist was mainly affected because he was out of water when he was riding on his bike through a desert like area, but because he was determined to reach water he made it through.
3	In the selection “Do not exceed posted speed limit” there are a lot of great details of the area around the cyclist. In the text, it makes it clear that the route the cyclist is traveling is very deserted when the drinking water was explained as oozing out and tasting like battery acid, you can tell that people hadn’t been there in awhile. Also, being informed that he was traveling through a desert, in June. I am able to understand how thirsty he is. Also, he is traveling for miles over a rough terrain and “crippling hills,” according to the text, so he has to be ovely exhausted. I could understand why he was so upset with getting wrong directions based on the troubles he encounters when he finally reaches the camp and drinks water, you too are glad he has reached somewhere that wasn’t empty and deserted.
1	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because the he was traveling through a hot place at a hot time of year and didn’t have much water. In the text it says “I was traveling the high desserts of California in June.” The deserts are always hot and June is a very hot month. The cyclist was getting thirsty quicker from the heat and wasn’t able to drink much because he had limited water.
2	The setting affected the cyclist because since it was the California desert, and it was in June, it was very hot and dry. Which caused him to get very thirsty and drink all his water. After almost all his water was gone, he began to get very tired, and since it is the desert, there isn’t any one around to help him if he dehydrates and blacks out, so he has to persevere and really push through the situation if he wants to survive. But he eventually finds a bait shop and he has a drink there so he is okay.
8	Dear Newspaper, In my opinion, I think computers do benefit society. One reason is because people can learn about new things, it makes life a little easier then it is, and lastly, people can meet new people while they're on the computer. First off, we can benefit from computers because we can learn new things. People can find places that they've never heard of, or they can see whats going on in the world. Computers can help kids that are in school who want to learn new things. Computers help you find out important information that you might need to know in the future. Secondly, having computers in our society can make life a little easier for some people. On computers, you can order things from online websites instead of trying to go out and buy them. For people with no transportation, this'll help make their lives a little easier than it is. Or, for example, if a person wants to buy something that isn't in stores yet, they can go online, and they might have it up there. Lastly, having computers can help you meet new people. If someone just moved from another town or state, this will help them meet new people. Or if a student doesn't know anybody from their new school, they might find them online and then they'll be able to get to know each other. In conclusion, computers help our society in a lot of ways. They can help us learn new things, we all can meet new people. and computers can make our live s a little easier. Thats whay I think we should keep computers in our society.
1	In the story Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit the setting greatly affects the cyclist. With long rides, hilly roads, and very little water the cyclist was pretty good. I mean he could have been very angry but he kept his cool and stayed calm.
3	The towns, the terrain, the Welch’s Grape Juice factory- all are parts of the setting that affect the cyclist. “This place might have been a thriving little spot at one time- say, before the last world war,” describes the cyclist, “but on that morning it fit the traditional definition of a ghost town.” The town intensifies the cyclist feeling of doubt, in that it is increasing. At this part, he is really regretting taking the old guy's advice in taking the “shortcut.” “Not two miles into the next section of the ride, I noticed the terrain changing,” reveals the cyclist. The cyclist is already very worried and very doubtful, and the terrain is making it worse it mirrors the town in which the cyclist had stopped at earlier to, again make his feeling of doubt increase. The cyclist exclaims, “ By the looks of it- had been a Welch’s Grape Juice Factory.” The cyclist gets very excited when he sees this, and gets a great feeling of hope. So throughout the whole story, the setting of where the cyclist is at affects his mood by giving him doubt, but by also giving him hope.  
2	The cyclist was biking through the California deserts olwing the warm summer months. The heat and uninhabited canal was the biggest struggle for the cyclist. For example, he thought there would be many stops for water decive his trip, but he was mistaken. Also he runs out of water very quickly because of being dehydrated in the heat. The cyclist became irritated with himself for trusting someone else to give him directions for a shortcut. The setting affected the cyclist’s mood in a negative way.  
2	There were many features in the setting of this bike race that affected the cyclist. It stated, “flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills” (Kurmaskie @NUM1). The cyclist was  pedaling fine until these big hills came into affect and his energy was running lower as he went along. Also it stated,” At some point tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake” (Kurmaskie @NUM2). This debris and snake made him stop because he got scared and slowed him down. There was a lot of features in the setting that made the cyclist affected to slow him down and lose energy.
3	Many things caneffect a cyclist and how they ride, in this essay many things effected him such as the setting of the story. One of the problems of the setting was there were no stores or even people, another and most important thing was the lack of water around him, so many things can effect a cyclist while They are riding inculding there suriondings.
2	The second photograph better communicates ideas similar to the ideas expressed in the essay “A sea worry “, because the story is about a boy who surfs as a job &amp; in the second picture a boy is surfing. The author says “my son body-surfs. He says it’s his “job”. That quote was explaining that he’s a body-surfer &amp; it’s his occupation. This is the reason I chose the secod photograph.
1	Condition the cyclist is in affect a lot of how they ride. One example of this is, “I was travelling through the high desert of California in June.” @CAPS1 to this fact the cyclist had went into a “dehydrated state” because of not having much water. When your travelling in hot weather areas without much water your body will become dehydrated from sweating. Cycling in different conditions will affect cyclists diffently.
2	Many features of the setting affected the cyclist in “Rough Road Ahead.” First, the scorching heat of the desert  in June was a major problem that had him to the brink of dehydration. In the text it states, “I could drop from heatstroke in a gorgeous day in June (@CAPS1).” This shows the effect the exposure  to heat had on @NUM1 cyclist. Also, the terrain posed a threat to his well being during the story. In the text it says “I toiled on( @CAPS2).” This shows the increase in effort in strain the  terrain caused on the cyclist during his adventure.
2	In the story “Do not Exceed Posted Speed limit” by Joe Kurmaskie the features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. It being hott affected him because it mad him more thirsty. Than him being out in the middle of the desert made it so he couldn’t get any water. The hills made him tired and weak. All of the features in the setting had an affect on him, which made him powerless and thirsty.
1	The features that effect the cyclist are that he is riding his bike in the desert and doesnt have any water. That effects his journey because he is dehydrated so he needs to find water fast so it is making him get to Yosemite slower because he needs to find water. That is a feature that affects the cyclist
9	Dear Newspaper, People are spending way too much time on the computer and it is not right. They should be excercising, and interacting with friends and family. Having a computer also distracts them from schoolwork. Computers normally have effects like this on the people that use them. Instead of sitting at the computer all @DATE1 people should be out getting exercise. The @LOCATION1 is one of the coubtries with the most overweight people. Many teenagers are inside all @DATE1 at the computer waiting for their friends screename to pop up so they can talk to them. They don't need to be completely gone, but while they're waiting for their friend they could be exercising. All they need to do is put on some fun music and start dancing around, that will get them the excercise they need for the @DATE1. They also could do ten pushups and twenty curlups, or even more if they wanted to. Instead of sitting at the computer all @DATE1 exercise. Having a computer effects the owner because they don't have a lot of face-to-face converstions with friends and family. You can call your friend up and have them come over your house instead. If they can be at home on the computer for hours then they probably can hang out in real life. Instead of videochatting with your cousins in another state, lan for them to come visit you guys one @DATE1. That way you can actually talk to them and see what they're doing to. You could also play board games, hide and seek, etc. It is much more fun to be with someone in real life, then to talk with them online. The last but deffidently not least effect that computers have on peoples lives is it distracts them from school. Once you start talking with one of your friends, it's pretty hard to stop. Many people don't know how to stop so they don't do the homework they were supposed to do, or they didn't study for the big test the @DATE1, therefore they end up failing it. Some kids will do homework and a on the computer at the same time, the homework is probably wrong because they weren't concentrating on it hard enough. Having a computer effects your life in many different ways, some positive and some negative. Some ways are it &quot;stops&quot; you from exercising, it doesn't let you have face-to-face interaction with friends and family and it distracts many kids from school.
10	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, @CAPS3 a world where no information could be saved for the whole world to observe a place with no communication with loved ones or friends; or a life with no possible way of learning of catastrophe's on the other end of the earth. Clearly, a life without computers is utter chaos. Computers provide education, and stay in contact with friends and family I'm sure our world greatly benifits from this mericle. Medicine, @CAPS4, @CAPS5 constructing and revolutionizing our life has been made possible by computers. @PERSON1 is an old family friend of mine. He was one of the few people who was working on going to the moon for the very first time. They were astonished with what thier astronauts saw. But computers made the expirience a reality. @PERSON1 remembered recieving some of the first footage of he moon on to his computer, before the photographs and video are released to the public. However, @PERSON1 is not the only person who agrees. Johnson, a principal from a private school in @LOCATION1, after winning an award for best school in @LOCATION1 states @PERCENT1 of our education comes from the computers. We make our students come involved in technology. These are the people who progress to make the best medicine cars and computers. Our students all are benificial to our world today.&quot; @CAPS6 settle for anything less for our childrens' education? In the middle of trajedy; faced with a difficult decision; or even just lonely, longing for someone to count on; who do you turn go first? Your loved ones they are always there for you when you need them. Now because of our access to computers whether accross the world or just the other end of the block. We will always be in contact with the ones we love. @PERSON2, my friend, found out her aunt diagnosed last year with cancer. However, she was in a boarding school in @LOCATION2 while her aunt needed her support. Instead, she was with her every step on webcam, emailing and @CAPS7. She could even contact her doctors to see her condition after. Her aunt conquered cancer with her neice and is living happily. With only a @NUM1 chance of living, @PERSON2 gave her the support she needed through most difficult @CAPS2. Not only did see the positive effects of staying in contact. Marcos a family therapist says @NUM2 of happy families stay in contact after seperating through internet.&quot; @CAPS8 could anyone, ever leave those who you care most about behind? @CAPS3 a world with a full education, for our children to take advantage of and a place where we can stay with each other all the time. Thats the world we we live in.
2	In the story the setting has a large affect on the cyclist. After taking advice from old people he ended up in the desert with no cars, buildings, or peopl. He was running low on water and had no way of getting anymore, and he was really dehydrated, he got really tired and almost gave up because of the heat and lack of water. All this was caused by the setting he was in.
1	The setting of the place was “ghost town” as the author said. It was a hot summer day in June so of course the cyclist would be dehydrating. There was no one around so he couldn’t ask for help. It was like an old town because he ran into old men who knew nothing of new world because they told him the wrong directions.
2	The setting affected the cyclist in a few different ways. At first it helped him. “The sun was beginning to beat down, but I barely noticed. The cool pines and rushing rivers” This is saying the pines and rivers helped him forget the sun. Later on the setting was against him. There was no place to get water and he was becoming dehydrated the terrain was getting rougher. There were no people around to help him, but there was a snake. All these features were working against him until he finally made it to a bait store. This bait store gave him water and a good map.  
2	In the story Rough Road Ahead by Joe @PERSON1 it tells of a cyclist heading for Yosemite National Park, and the problems he faced. For example the heat was a major issue the cyclist had to face. In the story it said “Drop from heatstroke.” this shows the setting affected him in a negative way, in the story heat was a major part of the setting that affected the character.
1	The features of the setting affected the author’s story a lot. It affected it by making the trip seem more difficult to the reader. This was made possible by telling how hot it was and explaining how the road was full of bumps or hills. The story says “over one long, crippling hill.” This makes the reader think the trip is very hard since he has to ride up so many hills. But if the road wasn’t as hilly then the trip would seem less difficult. This would also make it as if that the old guys gave good directions. But the whole point.
3	As soon as the cyclist gained information about which way to go, he set off through tall, cool pines. They  gave him a feeling of confidence, and physically cooled his body down. As he headed down the road, he encountered various small towns-none of which looked promising- which gave him a feeling of despair, in accordance to his lack of water. Even further  into. the journey, he found one last town, and arundown welche’s  @CAPS1 factory. This increased his thirst and gave him a feeling of spite towards the old men who had given him advice. However, he soon found a bait house where he could get water and escape the heat. For this he was satisfied and grateful to the owner. It made him realize to never again trust the old men.
1	The setting affects alot in a cyclist. For example if you are in a city you seel rush tired and everweled. But in a forest you are happy and a bit less stress. A setting sets the mode also the attude in the story.
3	The features of the setting affect the authors dispotion as well as his ability to complete the journey, thus creating an obstacle the author must overcome. At the end of the paragraph five the author writes that “I was traveling through the high deserts of California.” This setting is important because it adds a sense of urgency to his trip when he starts to run low on water. This is similair to when I was backpacking and a bear got most of our food. Our normal backpacking trip had become more of a game of survival. So, the water issue was clearly the main point of of conflict that the author presented in the setting. He also writes that “Not two miles into this next section of the ride, I noticed the terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.” This aspect of the setting also affects the cyclist because it makes it much harder for him to progress than if it was a downhill road. In short, the setting of the story presents the main points of conflict to the author and thus was essential to the essay.
2	In the essay, “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” the unbearable setting effects the cyclist with its harsh conditions. At first, in the cyclist’s own words, “ things began well enough.” @CAPS1, this soon changes. The road is long and filled with obstacles and the cyclist has hardly any water to sip. He does not give up, @CAPS1, in the text it says, “got back on the bike, but not bothered gathered up a few peldder and stuck them in my mouth.” He does this in order to reduce his need for water and continues, ignoring the tall the setting brings upon him.
1	The cyclist is effected by the setting in “Rough Road Ahead&quot; because the road is a place and if it is rough or unknown, its a direct effect on the traveler, who is the cyclist. If it is a hill then the cyclist would have to climb it. In the text it said , “over a long crippling hill,” the crippiling hill part stresses that the setting is a hill.
8	@ORGANIZATION1, @DATE1, people have been doing less exercise and not enjoying the great outdoors. They're some people that are having less family and friends times. I say its computers!&quot; This machine is a great resource, but people are starting to get adicted to it. We need to reach a messgae to those people. Yesterday, I went to my local library and found @NUM1 computers in the library. All of the computers were filled with people and, a line with @NUM2 people ready to go on next. I ask those @NUM2 people &quot;why were they there?&quot; &quot;for homework&quot; said a teenager. Another, &quot;just to come and paly&quot;. I also ask, &quot;how do they stay fit?&quot; &quot;I don't like @CAPS1 fit&quot; said beautiful lady. &quot;@CAPS1 fit isn't esay if your always on the computer&quot; said the teenager. The response I got from those people, were unbelievable. If we don't stay fit how are we going to survivie from all these dieases and cancer. This reason has pently to do witj not @CAPS1 fit. I don't know about you but I care about my family, I would never spend the rest of my life infront of a computer instead of my love ones. In the of , I was surprise to find out that projects, homework and research can take up half of your time, with your family. Do the computer, you can find some resort for you and your friends and fanily, you can't be doing for more than minutes. The great out doors should be one of the best places to be. because it quit, its amazing and its a large area. If you looking up the out doors on a computer, now thats a of time, that you could have been with a family member in the or where ever. My father says its great to buit its to live it. The days are getting shorter lets live it like.&quot;
2	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because there is mo water, hills, and deserts. When the cyclists saw water a wanting to jump in all he thought about was water that they lack like battery acid.Then the hills slowed him down from the water. The desert just made him want water even more. That are some features of the settings that affected the cyclist.
2	There were many features in the setting that affected the cyclist. One was the extreme heat during the June heat in California. The speaker said that he could have died from heatstroke. The rough road was also a problem for the cyclist. The bumps, hills and wildlife affected the cyclist’s journey. The thing that most affected him was the lack of water. It was such a problem that he had to suck on stones to take his mind off thirst. As you can see, these problems in the story affected the speaker’s journey to Yosemite National Park.
3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist. He is riding in the desert where there is low to rain. This means that he can’t collect any water to drink if he runs out. Also, deserts are hot. The heat will speed up the dehydration process so he will need more water to survive. If he runs out of water, he will die. The cyclist finds a building, but it is abandoned and empty. All these features of the setting affect him. Since he can‘t find water, he has to conserve what he has. Also, the heat is killing him. It doesn’t help to have an abandoned building be the only one he finds. During the whole time that there is death in the air, the desert with nothing growing, no water, the cyclist is thinking about his death. As long as he thinks about his death, there is only more death. As soon as he puts the pebbles in his mouth to stop thinking about death and being thirsty, he sees a bait shop which saves his life. He thought about his surviving, and immediately found a shop to and he could drink.
2	The setting affected the cyclist greatly throughout his ride. “The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips and the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke (pG @NUM1 kurmaskie).” This quote is saying that because of the heat, the rough terrain and the length of his “shortcut” his running out of water. That’s when he realizes he could die from heatstroke because he listened to a bunch of old men.
1	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. He is in the desert and has a low supply of water. Without water he tired very easily .On top of that he had to pedal a bicicle. So he was thirsty and tired prambeing in the desert. This is how the setting affected the cyclist.
1	Setting affects the cyclist. The cyclist has to worry about the road condition. If the road condition is bad then the cyclist must reduce his/her speed. The cyclist also has to worry about if it is day or night. If it is night, they must be careful due to cars not being able to see them. In the text, the cyclist was in extremely hot weather. This is dangerous to cyclist if they are not prepared with things such as water.
3	The setting affects the cyclist because the cyclist believes that he has a nice, short, flat distance to travel to get to Yosemite but instead it is a long, hilly(rough),  hot journey. He only prepared himself for a quick ride, bringing only enough water for that ride, and wasn’t prepared for the reality of his ride. First of all he is riding in the middle of the day (the hottest part) in the “high deserts of colifornia in June” I know when I go to camp here in @LOCATION1 during the summer I drink I drink six to seven liters, but the author only mentions a &quot;few bottles of water&quot; which aren't going to help him in that heat. Secondly, the cyclist believed that the old men had given him a safe path to follow but instead he came across a “ridiculously large snake. It really looked like a diamond back” That is a poisonous snake and the cyclist has barely able to “ease post” it because, of his lack of water. Lastly, the cyclist expected the old men to give him an easy path on a flat terrain when in fact it was “replaced by short, rolling hills” which means you have to put more effort (using more water) to climb the hills. The setting definetely affects the cyclist because it makes it more difficult for him to reach his destination but without a few bumps in the road, how is he to learn a life lesson?
1	The cyclist is affected by the features of the setting a lot. For example the dry hot place makes him thirsty. Then the ghost towns make it hard to get supplies. Also the bad road slowed him down. The bad roads even would probably hurt him and his bike the roads also would make him work harder.
1	The features of the setting affected the cycalist in many bad ways. For example in the text it says how “I eased past trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state”. Meaning that he had trouble being in a place he didn’t know well of and he was dehydrated. In conclusion the setting did affect the cyclist.
2	First the bike encounters flat roads in the desert which are very easy to navigate through; when he gets to his first town he still goes on trying to get to Yosemite, then after is going low so he looks for some more water to help him go. Then he kept going and he experienced a fork in the road. After the fork he kept going and he then faced another problem. That problem was an old person told him to go @NUM1 miles to the town and he didn’t trust the guy. Then the biker listened and he went on down the road. He then faced his next problem. The flat road started to get very wary with short high and low hills. These hills reduced his stamina greatly. Then he had to deal with a rocky and bumpy desteart road. He then had to face a snake and he had to avoid it so it didn’t attack him. Finally the biker faced his  las long hill and he finally found a bait and tackle shop with lots of water.
9	Dear Local newspaper, I agree that computers have an effect on people. It helps people learn hand-eye coordination, give people the ability to learn a far places and you can talk online with other people. Computers teach hand-eye coordination. As @CAPS1 grow up, they learn about letters of the alphabet and spelling. There are many online programs that teach @CAPS1 how to type. Once the @CAPS1 get in learning how to type, they end up typing fast. Computers help @CAPS1 of future learn &amp; with all these learning websites, @CAPS1 will be able ti teach them solves new things. Isn't it a blessing to be able to meet people from a far? You'll get ot learn there cultures. Would you want to know something about? They make daily go around, there you'll you? Well its so learning a new culture is a faster way of making friends. Have you connect. Oneday i will people who dont just want to be friends, maybe more than that. Be positive about online chatting, or online dating services. As you can see for my reasons above, the computer has an effect on people. The computer teaches you hand-eye coordination, it also gives you the ability to learn afar places &amp; people, and it allows you to chat with other online people. Make sure you stay positive &amp; be safe on the computers.
2	In “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” the cyclist is affected by the features of the setting by making him feel worse than he does. The cyclist is lost, has only found dirty water, and is moving on rough ground. The features of the setting are “cool pines and rushing rivers,” however, the cyclist comes to find that the “rushing river” is not so refreshing. He also encounters a terrain change, from flat road to short, rolling hills. There is a sign, “Do not exceed posted speed limit,” also the name of the passage with a limit of 55 mph, while the cyclist is only going 12 mph. Ironically, he finds a picture of a boy drinking grape juice at the factory, which cause him to hang his head in misery due to his intense thirst. Finally, he comes to a fish camp, where he encounters the owner who, ironically, tells him he’d be better off using his map.
2	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because he is going to be on the road a long time. The features of no buildings, no people and no cars, affect on the rider is that he feels helpless when he is low on water. The ghost town doesn’t help he because the old man told him about it and he thought he would be able to get more water. The grape juice factory affected him because he thought he would get a drink but it was abanded. This is how the features affect the cyclist.
2	Features of the setting would affect me if I was the cyclist because, I would be thinking I was going to die just like he did because, there is nothing to look at, no breeze, wind, he seen a snake, he had no water. He went through three towns that had nothing. The sun was setting down on him, it was hot, he had no hope. Who knows, maybe if he would have just went with what the map had said, he would have been fine.
2	The features of the setting affect the cyclist. The cyclist is running out of water and is in the intense heat in “the high deserts of California in June. The tumbleweeds that cross his path add to the desperation. Not only do the features of the setting affect the cyclist physically by dehydrating him in the heat, but also mentally. The cyclist encounters rolling hills, tumbleweeds rattle snakes and ghost towns. All of these make the cyclist start to give up hope. In conclusion, the features of the setting affect the cyclist physically and mentally.
2	The features of the setting greatly impacted the cyclist. First the setting at the middle of the story was empty and no place to get water. This filled the cyclist with doubt and despair, he/she thought they would die. The setting also made the cyclist thirsty because of the extreme heat. Finally the cyclist was filled with regret because they regretted listening to the old men because the cyclist didn’t make it where he/she wanted to go.
2	The author think that the setting means he is not getting any closer to his destination. However, he found out that there was still people around. He paniced and thought he was going to die. The places were desserted and he thought the lead nowhere. He was a little scared at the fact he might die because of everything around him was in a sense dead.
1	The setting really affected the cyclist. Since he was in the desert on a bike he was going to be hot and tired. Which would come from the sun coming down on him. You know he was hot where it said “wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt.”
2	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because they are extreme and do not change. The cyclist was riding on a small road in the desert. In the desert it was very hot and because of this the cyclist was sweating a lot and getting dehydrated. Also because he was in the desert he had no sense of direction. Also the towns are all run down with nothing in them, so the cyclist couldn’t get any water to drink to rehydrate himself. Only when he comes to a small bait shop close he finally get water.
2	The setting really afeted the cyclist alot.The sun and hot weather dehidrated him. He also had pretty much ran out of water. In the story he says &quot;The bottles contained only a few drops this shows that he had drank almost all of his water. Then it says &quot;the growing relization that I could drop from a leaf stroke&quot; shows the heat was affecting him.
2	The setting was calm and peaceful as he started out riding his bike. He was smiling and his legs were strong. As he hit the @NUM1 town and saw a ramshackled shed, rusty pumps, and a corral, he begun to be troubled b/c he was running out of water. As the flat rodes were replaced wI short, rolling hills he became even more troubled.  When he saw a building he became happy but when he found out it was run down he was sad, thirsty, and tired. When he finally saw an old man and told him he had a map he became a little happier b/c he was going to get to Yosemite. As the setting became worse his mood became worse b/c he had less and less water and felt very hopeless. But when he saw the man he became happy b/c the map was going to help him.
8	@ORGANIZATION1, The computer to me is very beneficial. I say that because if wasn't @CAPS4 the computers we wouldn't have as much knowledge about other contries like we do now. Also because it's another source of communication. Another reason is, the computer helps kids get their work done faster. Hopefully after reading this you will think the same I do about computers. First the computer helps people know about what happen with people in other islands. @CAPS4 example you heard about the @CAPS1 that happen in @LOCATION1 by t.v. But what if you wanted to get more information about it. All you had to do is type it in and it gives you a lot of information. Also it shows how the in the other places are and how people have in deal with all of that. Another example is communication. The computer has allowed people to have a conversation without a phone or being in person. That helps people a lot because not everyone likes to be on the phone all day (me) so that their of communication. Also you can go on website @CAPS2, @CAPS3 or other places to talk to your friends. Some people prefer to have penpals. A penpal is a way you can communicate with someone you never and from another contry, more you have @NUM1 reasons on how you can communicate from your computers. My theird reason why computers are beneficial is the get done with their ways @CAPS4 example lets just say you had to find so definitions, instead of looking the word in the dictionary you can just type in the definition. Also if you have to do in history you can go on the computer and find on him/her. So I hope you take this in consideration that computer are great @CAPS4 society.
3	The setting of this story is very rigurous. At the begining of the story the boy was fine. He had a bottle of water with him so that he didn’t get dehydrated. When he was riding he started to feel the sun get higher into the sky, though he could barely feel. It because of the pines that caused the road, and the cool feel of the river. The cyclist got to the second town on his journey and he had been drinking his water all day and was about out. He had found a water pump. He got down on his knees and palled with his night hot all that came but was blackish water. He just feared the water and stated that it tasted like battery acid. He began to ride again. Not two miles up the road the terrain changed. Not only was it rolling hills, it was also getting hotter. He was majorly dehydrated because he was out of water except nor a few “tantalizing sips. Dry sweat circled his shirt and he was afraid he could froz up heatstrokes. Where he was at was in the middle of no where, with no buildings, cars or structures in sight. Over were of the hills he saw a building came in no view. He wiped the sweat off his eyes so makee sure it was not a malinge,” By the lols of it had been a Welch’s @CAPS1 @CAPS2 Factory.” He is a dehydrated and tired that he could see a “Young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice in his mouth.” There is only the problems it is abandoned. This person was imagining things. He got back on his bike and stuck pebbles into mouth. This was to help tabe his mind off being thirst.
1	I read “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” written by Joe Kurmaskie in the story the features of the setting affect the cyclist by accepting advice from “old timers who haven’t left the confines of their porches @CAPS1 was in office”
3	In the essay “Do not exceed posted speed limit” by Joe Kurmaskie, the features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. First, the sun is making the cyclist hot and dehydrated. He states “The sun was beginning to beat down,” @CAPS1, the sun was a big factor on the affect on the cyclist. Also, the hills of the country roads. Going up and down hills take alot of work you have to use alot of energy. The cyclist says “@CAPS2 were replaced by short, rolling hills.” @CAPS3, there were snakes in the road, which make the cyclist timid looking out for snakes so he would not get bit. Againg the cyclist states “dimond back-blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me.” @CAPS4, there was an old factory that gave the cyclist hope and then crushed his hopes. The factory even made him more thirsty. @CAPS1, there were many affects on the cyclist due to the setting.
2	The features of the setting take their toll on the unfortunate cyclist. For example.” I was travelling through the high deserts of California in June.” The deserts of California especially in June are hot and dry and caused the cyclist to use much of his water supply, very quickly. As he “toiled” on, the terrain features became even more trying,” over one long, crippling hill…”By this time the cyclist barely had enough energy to make it over a hill from all the wear and tear his body was put through by the features of his setting.
1	The settings to this story has an encouraging impact on this story, because he is an alike ride. The terrain in the story sounds rough where he seen a sign marked, ‘Rough road ahead do note exceed posted speed limit.” He already has to go up and down hills with rocks and no water. Such a setting an a really athletic ride can be devastating. 
2	The feature of the cyclist and the settings arn’t that good. There’re insidents that are a problem. One is the bad weather. There is a tempature that makes it feels pretty close to @NUM1 degrees. He stops at a water pump, water comes out but it is really not cool. He takes two little sips and its like battarey acid. If he would to drink alot of that water it would probably kill him or make him very ill. He needs something because there was another town @NUM2 miles down the road so he has to find something to keep him going. As he is going down the road he sees a sign: Rough Road Ahead: Even though he is going 12 mph he could still hit a hole and go flying over his handle bars. If he does go over his handle bars he could run into the snake he saw then get eaten by the birds because he wouldn’t have any energic to get up. There’re some interesting sence in the story.
2	Heat, water supply, energy-all are features of setting that can affect a cyclist. First, is heat. When it is too warm out it makes it more difficult, and more inconvenient to ride. Second, is your water supply. If you are riding, and begin to run low on water, your in trouble. The author describes, “The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips”. If you arn’t prepared enough for your cycling journey, it will be extremely inconvenient when you run out of supplies. Lastly, is energy. If you run out of energy while cycling, you have nothing. Your energy is what keeps you moving and motivated. “With what I believe, was my last burst of energy, I maneuvered down the hill,” the author describes. When you are out of energy, your ride is over. all of these aspects are important to have before deciding to go on a cycling journey.
1	The features of the setting affect the setting affect the cyclist by. Dehydrating him due to the heat and lack of water and to see mirages. And he loses strength going over the many hills. And there is a very large snake he has to ride by that could have bitten him.
0	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because when you have hills to climb and little water, you will get dehydrated. Also the heat from the desert is so hot that it also can make you dehydrated. If you don’t  pace yourself and dont drink too much water you will be able to reach your goal. Your rest is a big thing for if you dont have energy, you will not get far.
1	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because the hills made it hard for him to ride his bike up and he was afraid of the grass becase it was tall and scary looking.
10	Dear to whom it @MONTH1 concern, @CAPS1 name is @PERSON1, and I feel computers are bad for society. Computers have been the big difference when comparing @NUM1 to @NUM2 centuries. People have come to rely too heavily on computers. The communication globally has not been very helpful and people are spending hours on their computers every day instead of exercising. On the whole I feel society would be better off without computers. At the end of @DATE1 before the millenea would take place everyone feared what was called @NUM3. The year two thousand would supposedly be when all computers shut down and didn't work. Computers were at their beggining for society so everyone thought they were great. People were panicing over the thought of their precious computers not working. The entire nation had become reliant on computers. Everyone hid in attics and basements waiting for the world to end. Do you know what happened? The sun came out the next day and everyone logged onto their emails with a sigh of relief. Not only relief for the world not ending but for the life of computers to be able to go on. People still rely on computers just as much more today. I recently visited @LOCATION1 and in a rest every where the even had their laptop that they had to take everywhere with them. In conclusion the @CAPS2 society is at a sad state with how much they rely on computers. A fast instinct is to say communication when you why humans need computers. Why is that? We have telephones. Is there nation television channels? We have plenty of means of communication, such as ways like maybe writing a letter to someone? Communication would not be a problem in fact it has mainly caused trouble. Computers and internet allow news to be spread quickly even if it isn't free, damaging someones carrer and publicity. They also allow communication with foreign countries. Exess communication that can get countries into wars. Normally the @LOCATION3 would have no idea whats going on but with internet the nation is involved quickly. Computers breed had communication and you can easily communicate other ways with family and friends. Since I am a teen I also know the problems with youths and computers. Often times kids don't want to go outside and istead sit inside on the computer. Obesity is a rising issue in @LOCATION2 and kids need to exercise. Kids also dislike going on trips like camping outings because they don't want to leave their computer. Without computers kids would get more exercise and be less overweight. Now you have seen @CAPS1 reasoning that society would be in much better if there were no computers.
2	In the story “Do not exceed Posted Speed limit” a cyclist takes a journey through terrain to get to Yosemite. In that part of California there are not a lot of towns or people. The rode he is rideing on is very dangerous and long. It is very dry and hot out there but
2	The setting can affect a cyclist in a lot of ways. One way setting affects cyclist is when it is hot, it is harder to cycle long distances. I say this because in the story the narrator says “…and the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke…” @CAPS1 part of setting that affects cyclist is the terrain they cycle on. For example it is much easy to cycle on flat smooth ground than it is on the rolling hills with rough, rocky ground. This is shown with the quote “…ride down into distances I could see over the horizon, telling myself that if I could make it that far, I’d be fine.” Setting can have a great deal of affect on a cyclist, depending on if its smooth or rocky, or hot or cool. 
2	In Joe Kurmaskie’s “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed the Speed Limit” the features of the setting affects the cyclist a great deal. Each feature causing the cyclist to act. For example, in reaching the ‘ramshackle shed’ the cyclist finds the water inusuable; which causes to conserve water and try to head for the next town. That action leads him deeper into the high deserts of California during June. Also as the terrain changes from flat road to short, rolling hills the cyclist must change his speed to better survive and continue in his dehydrated state. The scarcity of buildings in this dry desert terrain causes the cyclist to try every ‘shack or building he comes across for water. In this story the features of the setting dictates the actions of the cyclist in his quest to survive in the desert a lot.
3	The cyclist in the essay, “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” is about a great adventure gone bad. He has every thing he needs but some how it turns out bad. He get low on water &amp; the setting is horrible. He is on his way from a camp ground in @LOCATION2, @LOCATION1 to the Yosemite river. He gets bad directions from old guys at the camps ground. On his way he ran into two abandon towns &amp; was running out of water then he came to a sign that said, “Rough Road Ahead: Do not Exceed Posted Speed Limit.” He was pedeling over hills &amp; becoming dehydrated when he tought he was going to die he came to a bait shop &amp; got waiter &amp; met an old guy who was going to give him direction &amp; he decided he better stick to the map. Even though the setting got worse through the story &amp; stuck it out &amp; made it to the end.
2	Heat, hills and ghost towns – all are features of setting that affect the cyclist. First, the heat dehydrates and exhausts him, almost causing him a heat stroke. He starts dinking more often, and nearly runs out of water. Next is the hills. They can take massive amounts of energy to climb. Which adds to his dehydration. Finally the ghost towns. They make his journey seem hopeless. Which could cause him to lose the will to carry on.
1	The cyclist is in the desert which @NUM1 degrees with water that tastes like the battery acid. The desert makes him see the mirages having sweat get into his eyes. In the story  “Do Not exceed Posted Speed Limit” by Joe Kurmaskie 
1	In the story, “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” the author tells a story about when he took advice from “old folks” and became lost. The setting greatly affected him and his journey, for example “tumbleweeds crossed my path, and a ridiculously large snake…” and a “crippling hill” these quotes explain that the setting was quite scary.
2	He’s on a very hot climate, in a desert, so he needs lots of water, but he has a limited supply. He’s riding on hills, which makes it even harder. He can’t find any towns that aren’t abandoned.
1	In the story the features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. One way it affected him was time because of the road he had to go slower so took him longer to get to the town. Also because the road was harder to peddle on he got thristy and the water was really hot.
1	There were several features of the setting that held an affect on the cyclist in this story. For one, the cyclist was riding in a hot desert. This condition normally prevents one from obtaining water. Seeing as how water was a necessity for the cyclist, the lack there at due to the desert created the conflict of dehydration. Additionally, the town that was abandoned triggered a spark of doubt in the cyclist’s mind. The cyclist now had to ride with his brain in doubt and his body in desperate hope. By the time he/she reaches the old factory, the cyclist is extremely dehydrated. Now his head is screaming with annoyance and his body is screaming with lack of water. This abandoned juice factory almost completely wiped out the cyclist hope. A man is little to nothing without hope. Therefore, this abandoned factory had a negative affect on him. Now, the only reason he continues is out of his/her desperation of survival, an instinct in all of us. In conclusion, the desert removed water and the abandoned homes and factory removed hope and all three created a negative affect. The cyclist is lucky to have survived. 
7	Dear local newspaper, I think computers are used way to much in this society! People spend more hours sitting the computer than exercising because people find it more thrilling spending more time with computers than trreadmills! People in this society think we are spending to much time on the computers, while others don't realize how long they've been staring at a screen for! I am one of those people who like using the computer a lot but I have relized changes. I can tell many others and spend to much time with the computer screen that we have drifted away from our familys! I never really thought about how much I don't talk to them anymore because I'm to busy cyberly chatting with friends. Although, I don't think we should get the computer either. Online we can research almost everything in the world. I can even type my name in a research bar and find me and anybody else with the excel same name as me! The internet got for more technical in the past years. Without it, these days, just about everybody would be lost! The internet should be used less on blogging and chatting, and should be used more on things more useful like @CAPS1.com or @CAPS2.com. I hope you consider this.
1	The setting affected the cyclist, because he didn’t know if he was going to die or live. He had used up all his water because it was so hot and his mouth was dry.
2	In the short story “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” by Joe Kurmaskie, he shows features of the setting played that affects the cyclist in many different ways. A setting the cyclist faces is that its so hot he keeps taking (drinking) water, and worrying that he is going to run out. Kurmaskie writes, “ I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly, and I was traveling through the high deserts of California in @NUM1). This is what the cyclist gets affected by throuout the whole story as he releizes he could die of heatstroke if he dosent watch how much water hes drinking. Also, this is what a lot of people normally face which is a challenge cause of dehydration.
1	With age comes wisdom and all that, but the world is a fluid place things change No a better piece of advice for the solo cyclist. Never travel advice home old-timers who haven’th confines of use porches.Flat road was replaced by short rolling hills. Rough Road ahead Do not exceed posted speed limit.
2	Many things about the setting in “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” affect the cyclist. The terrain in this story is hilly and filled with deserts. This contributes to the cyclist nagging sensation for a drink of water. The ride on the hills and through the desert, also tire him out dramatically. Not to mention while he is severely dehydrated, and when he finds the water it is “tarlike” and &quot;in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees”. The cyclist in this story really must want to get Yosemite National park if he is willing to go all through all this trouble. The old men he asked in Lodi, California hadn’t left the town in decades and gave the cyclist faulty directions that could of killed him. So he asked for directions and was given inadequet information, which made life very difficult for the cyclist.
3	The setting of “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” affect the cyclist so many ways. First of all, the cyclist is riding in a desert, in mid- June, with the heat “beginning to beat down” on him. This feature of the setting causes the cyclist to drink more water, but when his supply of water was running low, he was unable to drink much water to hydrate himself. The cyclist began to realize that he “could trap from heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June.” @CAPS1, the long distance and changes in the terrain that the cyclist was travelling, affected him. The distance on which to cyclist was travelling to Yosemite National Park, consisted of hours and miles of riding. Over vast changes of terrain. The “flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills”, which affected the cyclist speed and energy to finish his trip.
1	A response that explains how the features of setting affect the cyclist by getting wrong dirachion The old man. One features when tough an ghost town. The old people in the didn’t know they were tell him. It made it haede for nam because that more harder roads and lesort water. He almost died.
1	The features of the setting will affect the cyclist because the roads are hilly and he is old so it will be hard for him to ride up them. It was very hot and he had a scares supply of water. He was seeing things that wasn’t there. When he did try to get some water, the weather was so hot that the water from the pump came out hot.
1	Well some features of the setting like the hotness is effecting the cyclist, for example he was riding through the high deserts of California and was drinking to much of his water. So when he stoped at a place the pipes and things to get water were rusty and old. Another was when he thought he could make it to the other town to get water their. He started his ride the the roads were hilly and short. Then the road turned into bumpy to. So know matter what we was having bad trouble any way. 
1	The character in this short story has a most that changes with his surroundings. Towards the beginning when he was enjoying his ride no said ‘’ The cool pines and rushing rivers of  Yosemite had my name all over them,’’ As time goes on and he begins to realize nobody inhabits the path he is on he becomes continues and the terrain become rougher.
2	There are many ways the features of the setting affect the cyclist. For instance the desert is not a hummid making is lack of water a bigger deal than normal. Also these are many hill making him have to use full force to get up them also making water a big deal. In conclusion I temperatures where level and it was flat land he could go further with less water supply.
9	I believe that computers are a great help to society I believe this @CAPS3 when you don'@CAPS1 know something you could go on-line to look it up. Also if you are to sick or don'@CAPS1 have time to go out and buy things that you need from stores you can buy it on-line and have it @CAPS7 right to your door. My final reason is that computers can save paper buy having a lot of document on your computer. My first reason was that if you don'@CAPS1 know something you could look it up. A lot of times you could be watching @CAPS1.V. or talking with someone and you @CAPS4 wonder what something is or means. @CAPS6 instead of just letting whatever you didn'@CAPS1 know just pass on you could look it up on a computer and educate yourself and possibly others to. My next reason was that if you are to sick or don'@CAPS1 have the time to go out and buy things that you need from stores you can buy it on-line and have it @CAPS7 right to you door. This is a great help to the people who are to sick @CAPS3 sometimes they are @CAPS6 said they can'@CAPS1 leace there home @CAPS6 instead of starving to death they can have food or anything @CAPS7 to them if they just click a couple of buttons on the computer. Now, also this could help the people who are to busy to go to stores @CAPS3 right before they leave they could press some buttons and when they get home there stuff on sitting there for you. Back when my dad was a @CAPS2 and my mom was a vice-president of a drug producing company which sold oxy-cofin they had to have a grocery @CAPS5 ship foods to our house. They had to have this happen @CAPS3 they @CAPS4 worked long hours and they didn'@CAPS1 have the time to go to a grocery @CAPS5 @CAPS6 they had the food @CAPS7 to our house which was a huge help. My last and final reason is that computers can help save a lot of trees and paper. A big thing now is that we have to go green right, @CAPS6 instead of cutting down more trees we can just have all that on our computer which doesn'@CAPS1 we any paper. These are just some of the reasons why computers are a help to society. I could come up with many more ideas but can'@CAPS1 fit them just in this story, @CAPS6 finally rember people whole lives are on their computers.
1	The features of the setting affect the cyclist by never accept travel advice from colletion of old timer who haven’t left there porches since carter was in office. After that because you don’t know if they are real collection or what. After because some people have not left there porches since carter was in office. I don’t know why people have not left there porches since carter was in office.
2	In the essay “Rough Road Ahead” by Joe Kurmaskie he accepts directions from old men for a shortcut to Yosemite National Park. He ends up cycling in a desert with no water just barley able to push the pedals of his bike. The setting affects the cyclist by it being so hot, him not having anything to drink, nowhere to get water or food and him maybe seeing mirages. In the essay it states, “Wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that I could drop from a heatstroke.” This shows that the lack of water and the surrounding enviroment with nowhere to go is making him give up hope to survive. It also says in the essay, “I wiped the sweat from my eyes to make sure it wasen’t a mirage, and tried not to get too excited. “The cyclist is coming out himself and stating that the dessert has him thinking hes seeing something and letting him down by it not being real. The desert setting of this essay effects the cyclist in many ways other then one.
1	In “Do not exceed posted speed limit” by Joe Kurmaskie: c, I think that e the setting affected the cyclist because he was thirsty and he thought he was going to die In this case he had no water left and he was in the desert. He was regreating not taking the advice of the stranger and was dieing of thirst. Also he dident have the mind set that he wanted to live. Thats how I think the setting affectd him.    
3	The features of the setting have a big impact on the cyclist. One feature is the hot weather and area he is in. He says he is in the “high desserts of California in June.” @CAPS1 being hot in @CAPS2, it has cyclist is around deserts, causing more heat. “I could drop from a heatstroke,” he says. Being hot from the sun beating down on him took away the cyclist’s energy he needs for riding his bike. Another feature that affected the cyclist was his lack of water. “Trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state.” This affected the cyclist by making him tired. Being tired from no water, the cyclist had trouble going up hills on his bike. The last feature that affected the cyclist was all of the hills in his road. “Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.” These hills made it hard to go up on a bike, considering his lack of water, and the heat. All of these features affect the cyclist by making him lose energy and get tired and frustarated because of their negative impact.
3	Nature has an affect on everyone, even when they don’t think it does. Expecially for cyclist traveling anywhere or everywhere. In “Do not exceed Posted Speed Limit” by Joe Kurmaskie is a perfect example about settings laffect people like cyclist. When you’re riding your bike as actually cross country transportation, you have to know what your doing and where you’re going. The cyclist in this story decided to take advice from older fellows and ends up going the wrong route for a cyclist because at these “town” they had no water, because they weren’t towns to begin with, not anymore atleast. If you don’t have any water like this guy did hills could kill you. And in any case, you have to know what to do for example.” l gathered a few pebbles and struck them in my mouth. I’d read once that sucking on stones help take your mind off thrist” This guy knew a little bit of survival tips. If he’d gone all that way without standing up yo his thrist and those hills, he probably would have had some kind of stroke. That is just a few way that setting could harm you.  
1	Some of the feature setting that effect the cyclist was the seal was begging to lent down, but he truly noticed it and about twenty miles up the road he came to park of sorts. The cyclist was riding through the high deserts of California in June. He get on his hands and hence working on the heated handle of the rusty pump. The pump began it shoot out a tarlike substance and the water was feeling somewhere of two hundred degrees. Two more miles I noticed the terrain changing from a flat road to a short, rolling hills.” He said tumble weeds crossed her path and a large snake crossed her pavement. He gather some pebbles and stuck them in his mouth, after reading that if sucking of stones helps to be your mind off thirst. Well after reading of I believed these settings did effect the cyclist.
3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist in many was. First, the “town” The cyclist first comes upon is described as a ghost town. Although the cyclist chuckles about it, this setting sets up the long journey the cyclist has a head of him. There were other features that would negatively affect the cyclist. For example, “…I noticed the terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.” (pg @NUM1). Flat land is much easier for a cyclist to pedal on. The change from flat land to hills affected his stamena and will to keep going. He really had to push himself to trudge up and down each hill. His determination finally led him to, “Gary and Wilber’s Fish camp…” (pg @NUM2). He finally found hope.   
1	In the story Rough road ahead do not exceed posted speed limit by Joe Kurmaskie the features had a more negative affect on the cyclist. The cyclist got tired because of the big hills and he liked the scene which was they only good that if had on hon. “The water bottle only contained a few tantallizg sips.” he didnt have enough water and he was thirsty. “At some point a rediculously large  snak it really did look like dimond back–bloked the majority of the pavement.” It is dangerous where he was riding and even though he was on a bike he could have been bit. All of these points I made showed the negative affect.
1	The desert like land affected the cyclist by making him tired and loss of body water, then that therefor making him need water to go on. I think the thought of being so thirsty made him become more weak. If he wasn’t thinking about it the ride wouldnt have bin so ruff
1	In the cyclist’s outlook on his journey through Yosemite’s park, reader’s can get a good feel of how it might be to be riding right along side. It seems that it is very beautiful along the bike ride. He sees such a vast variety of scenery including rivers, sandy dry deserts also, as well as cool pines and trees in the park part. He said it was also breezy which probably made for an enjoyable temperature.
9	The use of computers is great for everyone. Using a computer can help you learn about different people from around the world. Also you can have the ability to talk to people. With a computer you can also learn about places all over the @LOCATION1 and the world. With a computer everyone can learn about people all over. If you were going on a vacation to somewhere in @LOCATION2 you could learn about what those people do. Also you can see what people your age do for a living. If you had to do a project for school about a place outside of the @LOCATION1 the computer would help a lot. You can search what thet wear and what holdays those people celebrate. Learning about people will help you make friends to. if a foreign exchange person comes to your school you can search about their culture and talk to than about it. While using a computer you can also talk to people. With the use of @CAPS1 or A.I.M you can talk to your friends easily. You can ask them what homework you had if you weren't in dschool. You can also become better well friends with people you didn't know that wll, by saying hello, or how was your day. You can also email. If you meet someone you made friends with on vacation you can email them. You can also go to websites where you can talk to people in other countris. If you have a webcamyou can even video chat, and ask them questions about their country, or what they like. Also you can videochat with all yor friends to. Using a computer you can learn about places arounf the world. If you were going to a place ypu didn't know, you could look up the amazing resraurants, you could also look up fun things to do with the family. If you needed to do a projecct you can look up what the weather is like, and what the people do. if you wanted to help out a country that just had an earthquake or hurricane you could look up what you could do to help that country. Those three reasons are why compujters are essential to people. You can learn about different people, talk to your friends, and you can search and learn about different places arounf the world.
2	The features oF the bike ride to Yosemite through California in June affect the cyclist. Some of the features were it was hot high deserts, and no water. This affected the author by making him dehydrated and tired, which made it hard for him to find water or to get to Yosemite. In this cass the outhor says “The sun was beating down on me”. The author is hot From the sun. He says “The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips”. He is showing how he hasno water and is probably dehydrated. All of those features are affecting the way he is traveling and getting to water.  
2	In the essay, “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” there are many features of the setting that greatly affect the cyclist. Many of these features affect him in a negative way. One such feature is the hills that are present in the essay. These probably exasperated the cyclist even more than he already was with the sun beating down on him. Another feature was the road sign that said “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” “The speed limit was @NUM1. I was doing a water-depleting @NUM2. Sometimes life can feel so cruel.” The author/cyclist probably felt like he would never make it. Also, the sign advertising grape juice probably made him feel life was even crueler with its sadistic irony. Finally, the bait shop offered much relief to the cyclist. “I had an overwhelming urge to seek out Gary and Wilber, kiss them, and buy some bait.” All in all, the setting affected the cyclist in some pretty bad ways until the end.
3	Many features of the setting affected the cyclist. First, the heat was the main part of nature that threw him off. It caused him to go dehiderated because lack of water and he went kind of dilerious. He thought he was seeing things and his vision was distorted. Next, the water he had to come across in the pump was un drinkable because of the tarlike substance coming out of it and the degree of water he said it was, which was @NUM1 degree. Lastly, the Welch’s factory that he came across was teasing him in in the way that he couldn’t have the liquids he needed and the little boy advertised on the building was drinking his refreshed Welch’s juice. Not only did the cyclist get off track because the directions, the setting made his bike adventure to Yosemite even more unbearable.
1	The setting effects the cyclist in many ways, first is that it is very hot in the desert. Second is that there aren’t many towns out there. Finally is that water is hard to find out there, so if he get thirsty it would be hard to get more water if you didn’t find a town.
3	The setting affects the cyclist in almost everything he does and everything he faces. The setting is a hot day in June in the dessert. There are many hills and the terrain changes a few times. Because the day is hot the cyclist drinks lots of water. And because he drinks lots of water he very soon runs out. In the story it states, “I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly, and I was traveling through the high desserts of California in June. This quote shows that because it was so hot, the cyclist drank lots of water and because he drank lots of water he very quickly run out of water. Also in the story it states, “Flat road was replaced by short rolling hills.” This quote suggests that becaused the terrain changed to hills, the cyclist became very tired and hot from having to pedal up and down those hills. And because this caused him become hot and tired he also drank his water more quickly than if he was pedaling on a flat paved road in a cool day in @DATE1. In conclusion the setting causes the cyclist to become tired, hot, and thirsty, which affects his entire journey.
2	The features of the setting in the story affect the cyclist by describing that he is in a desert-like area in Lodi, California. They say it is very hot and there is sand everywhere. There also aren’t many places to cool off at. They also described the water and Lodi to be about @NUM1 degree in temperature. The cyclist was trying to get to Yosemite to get away from the heat and to have a cool, shady pine trees to sit under, and cool fresh water. This affects the cyclist because he gets dehydrated because of the horrid heat.
1	The features of the setting have a large affect on the cyclist. If a cyclist would happen to be cycling in the snow, he or she could eat snow do keep from dehydration. If the cyclist in,”Do Not Exceed Posted  Speed Limit&quot;, was cycling in winter time, he would of been so thirsty all of the time. Also if the whole ride was down hill, he would be so tired,
3	The conditions for the cyclist in the story “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” are pretty dangerous. “a ridiculously large snake blocked the majority of the pavement balance my dehydrated state bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips” (kurmaskie, @NUM1). There was a rather large snake in his path. You can tell he isn’t an expert on snakes because he couldn’t identify it. Because he is in the desert on a long bike ride, he is dehydrated. His water supply is almost gone. The cyclist feared many dangerous challenges in his journey.
2	The features of the setting that affect the cyclist are the terrain, the lack of provisions and the power of self- determination. The terrain affected the cyclist by having he/she ride through rough paths inorder to reach their destination.For example, if you walk on sharp rocks, you are based to reach some rough spots where it seems you can’t walk. But that is where self–determination kicks in. The power to keep yourself moving even though there @MONTH1 be obstacles in your way; you know there will be a better path or a reward at the end another example of a feature is a lack of provision on your trip, when you don’t have the right provision to keep you self energised you can ‘t get over your obstacles or even push yourself to do anything.This is why the features of the setting affect the cyclist.
8	@ORGANIZATION1, The delema over computers needs to be noticed. People need to relize computers are one of the greatest inventions we have in our time, but in my opinion people take that as an advantage and misuse them for purposes that they should not be used. Computers are not meant to be for playing games, or constently instent messaging. They are meant for learning purposes and for work or school. Why do people use computars for things that they dont need? People use computers for fun! They instant message, listen to music, go on @CAPS1, @CAPS2, or @CAPS3. People also use @CAPS4 and play games on unknown websites. Computers are not ment to be for that, they are for school and work. @ORGANIZATION2, word, @ORGANIZATION2, and powerpoint, if computers were used for those purposes people wouldnt be the way they are today. In the @LOCATION1 the computer is very popular people aboulutly love it! But these people are the people who are unfriendly, mean and sad. They also are incredibly out of shape. I know so many people who use computers instead of doing homework and getting fresh air. They are so independent they do when they go home from school is eat and play on the computer. I have a hard time understanding why they do that but I guess they feel they have nothing else better to do. I also know people who use the computer the right way and they are very happy people. They also have so much knowledge and there is never a dull conversationthem. Those people use the computer everyday but they use it correctly only for and they are just well are very smart and get good grades in school! Basically, what I am trying to say is that people who use the computer suceed in anything they do because they know how to use and understand the computer, but people who use it in the wrong ways will just be miserable because they dont know to much, they had average grades and they are unhealthey.
2	In “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Limit” by Joe Kurmaskie, the terrain has a negative effect on the author. He claims that “I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly, and I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June” (Kurmaskie). This shows that he has been drinking his water too fast due to the heat from being in the desert at summertime. After travelling from a long time with no water he lets out a chuckles thinking of how he shouldn’t have taken the old mens advise. He explains that “It was a sad, hopeless laugh, mind you, but atleast I still had the energy to feel sorry for myself.” This is an example of how badly the terrain had effected him. Its gotten to him so much that he applauds himself for having the energy to feel sorry for himself.
1	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because the cyclist is tired and thirsty already. The features include a desert like setting of California, it is extremely hot, there are no signs of civilization in sight, and the roads are like hills that always were throughout the desert. On top of those facts the cyclist is dehydrating because his water suposely has diminished. 
2	The setting of the short cut affected the cyclist in many ways. For example, he said there was rusty water, and &quot;it tasted like battery acid&quot; because of this he was not able to drink it which made him become dehydrated. Also in the story is says, &quot;flat roads were replaced by short rolling hills.&quot; This could of made the journey even harder for the cyclist because now he had a little more effort to get up the hills one more example is towards the end he says &quot;i began breaking my ride down into distances, i could see the horizon telling myself i could make it there.&quot; By the cyclist saying this it seems like he has given up and he realizes that this journey is going to never end untill he dies. That is how the setting on the story affected the cyclist.
2	Some features of the setting affected the cyclist. The rolling hills, poisonous snake, and the conditions of the road worried her. For example, @CAPS1 said, “I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean, leaving only some expensive outdoor gear and the diary.” @CAPS1 had high doubt when saying that quote. @CAPS1 didn't think @CAPS1 would ever make it. Finally, @CAPS1 reached another destination and again finding herself asking another older man for directions!
3	In “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” by @PERSON1, the features of the setting greatly affect the cyclist. The first major example is when the cyclist finds that the flat road is turning into “short, rolling hills,” These hills are increasing the difficulty and are causing him doubt that he will make it. An additional part of the setting which caused major doubt was that he was in a deserted desert. “There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind.” The horizon was what kept cyclist going. “I began breaking the ride down into distarres: I could see on the horizon, telling myself that if I could make it that far, I’d be fine.’ The horizon kept him hopeful and determined. Without the setting he would not have been in such a serious but luckily in the end the setting helped him be determined enough to make it.
0	I guess really sofcty comes first, and you have to be cautious when yay out in the streets on a bicycle. I really don’t understand much, so I can’t write much.
2	When the biker listened to the old folks he had confidence. He biked to the first town but it was like a “ghost town.” A town is a town. soon after that, he did not see anything. No cars, buildings, or anything. He was getting sad and dehydrated. The old men swore there was a town coming up so he put his trust and confidence in him once again. He saw a building  coming up, but it was just an old wore down factory. He thought he was let down. He was sure he was going to die, right there right now. He than saw a siga for a fish comp! He was overjoyed! The place was real to! He thought of them as his savior! The settings effect the cyclist tremendously.
1	In the story “Rough Road Ahead Do Not Exceed Posted Limit” by Joe Kurmaskie there were many settings that affect the cyclist. One example would be when he came up to a water pump and he tried to get water out but water didn’t come out. “…working the handle of the rusted water pump with all my strength. A tar like substance oozed out….” (Kurmaskie). Another example is when he came across rolling hills, and the scaring heat, he also came across a snake that took up most of the pavement.
0	The feautures of the settings affect the cyclist if it is just between buildings and cars the cyclist won't be able to break free and bicycle freely. So it can affect him.
1	The setting in the story was hot. The biker was sweating a lot. The whole town was empty. He pasted empty buildings. Their were rivers and big hills that he had to ride through. As it says about the buildings, “somehow, I climbed away from the abandoned factory of juices and dreams, slowly gaining elevation while losing hope.” The setting would affect the cyclist because their was no one in the town. Also, their was high hills.
10	Dear @ORGANIZATION1, Computers are a great way to learn about the world and its people. Computers can teach people about things that are forien to them. Computers keep people intouch, all over the world. Computers also come in handy when something needs to be looked up right away. Computers are very helpful when it comes to learning. They can teach you things that most books cant, such as hand eye coordination also about the current populations of countrys and cities. Also, computers gives you the opportunity to see pictures of places and people that you couldn't find in books or photo albums or newspapers. They also help in schools when projects are asigned. Kids can use computers to find information they need quickly. Kids can also use computer to wright essays or print pictures for projects. Computers are definately a staple for learning &amp; education. Computers are also great for comunication. People can chat with one another on networking sites such as @CAPS1, facebook, myspace, and twitter. On these sites people can send messages to their friends a leaking them of something or chat with their friends to see whats to keep in touch with family and friends, on the computer. Family members can e-mail each other to inform them of an event or news. I have actually had an experience with e-mail that was very helpful my family members and I had been speaking of traveling to block island and two days before we were going to leave we recived on email from the owner of the house we were going to stay at stating that all phone lines were down and part of the house was ruined due to a storm. If it werent for computers we would have been in a sick situation. Computers also come in handy in times of need or confusion. People can check their local weather forecasts to see of the weather will effect their plans. Also if someone doesn't know where a house or store is located they cab quickly look it up on the computer. Finaly if something is unavailable on a store people can shop for it online and can buy what they need, and have it shaped to their door step. Computers have helped this country grow and prosper. Why bother to go aginst them when they benafit society so much? Computers are helping the world become a better educated, connected, and informed world.
2	The feature of the setting greatly affected the cyclist. He was a California desert in the month of June. There was no water in the desert so he had to use the water he had. He says the sun began taking harder ran and the terrain turned into short rolling hills. The hills made him work harder which dehydrate him guccher.and since there was no water in the desert, he could have died of dehydration
1	When your with your family in ocean city biking down the board walk your only obstacle is people. When your in a race on whinedy roads you could have lots of obstacles. The wheather could be your greatest obstacle. You could pass out by lack of water and scorcing heat. You could fall over by slippery roads from the rain. Along with that nature could lay its toll apon you. “a ridiculously large snake…blocked the majority of the pavement in front of @NUM1, Kurmaskie) @CAPS1 like a snake you don’t know what you could come across.
3	Many of the features of the setting affect the cyclist. The cyclist is biking through deserts. “A rediculously large snake” this quote shows that only is weather and climate agasint him but also nature.” I could drop from heat stroke” another great quote showing how hot it really is where the cyclist is.” There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind.” A great detailed desciption of where the cyclist is and how deserted the area is.” The bottle only contained a few  tantilising sips.” This cyclist is low on water in the desert and in the desert with no water that could be a very bad thing. The above quotes really draw you in and you get to see the many features of the setting and what its like for the cyclist.
2	The features of the setting in Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit.” Affect the cyclist in many ways. First in the essay when the @CAPS1 says he is in the deserts of California, that can affect because it gives them an idea of how hot it most likely was out there and how lack of water can really harm someone. Also when the @CAPS1 describes the water pumps and what comes out o them, it can give the cyclist a feeling of disgust and remind them to always keep a good water supply.
1	Many things in the setting of the essay &quot;Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” affected the cyclist throughout his journey. One very important part that affected the cyclist greatly is the fact that he was in a deserts without a good supply of water. Another part of the setting that challenged the cyclist was the length of his journey. Those two factors of his journey to Yosemite combined are probably the worst and most challenging things that affected the cyclist.
1	The features of the setting affected the cyclist because. It was a lack of the water and he was in the high deserts or California .For example in the text stated “when I tried a drop or two, it  had the flovor of battery acid. That showed clearly when he tried to get water from a pump what it clearly came out as the settling was extremely hot and made the cyclist misreable in such ways.
2	In the story the features of setting affect the cyclist because there is not much he can depend on. For example, it is the desert and usually there is nothing there. The cyclist only has a limited supply of what he needs and riding through there does not help him. For example, the old men who gave him directions made him think he could make it longer before he could elgo. This affected him because throughout his journey his lack of water slowed him down and made him think he wasn`t going to make it. When he finally got to “Gary &amp; Wilber’s fish camp,” he learned a lesson because when an old man asked if he know the quickest route to Yosemite he said yes, I have a very good map.''
3	In many real-life situations, nature or a setting can be the biggest hindrance in succeeding, or even surviving. For example, the cyclist with stood the blozing heat of the sun as he pedaled through what seemed to be the @CAPS1’s living room: Dry, desolate, and extremely scornful. “Wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that I could drop from a heat stroke on a gorgeous day in June.” @CAPS2 and depicts the intense heats of the desert. Another feature in the setting was the every hanging hills and steps though pedaling down the hills was an easier task, traveling up the hill, as well  as maneuvering the thirsts and bends served as a direct conflict. An example, “with what I believed was my last burst of energy I maneuvered a setting affect a situation is ultimately, the cyclist reached his destination is great relief. But the biggest hindrance was along his setting.                        
1	The features of the setting affected the cyclist because they made the simplist challenges for him. The back of water and the snake in his path are examples.
3	First, by accepting the old mens’ advice, the cyclist was setting himself up for some hardships that he would, easily have avoided by using his map. He first encounters a “ghost town”, lifeless and most importantly, waterless. Then, he encounters a pump that gives out water tasting like “battery acid”. Next he rides past a “Rough Road Ahead” sign; not the most encouraging thing on his journey. To add to the despair, he has to manever his way past a tempting yet empty juice factory. Finally, the parched cyclist arrives at “Gary and Wilber’s Fish Camp. “To him, this simple bait shop was like  beacon of hope from food himself.
9	Wouldnt it be great to use computers in everyday life? In this country we can. You can use it to talk to people you never thought you would see again. Looking at places far away is always an option. You can even simply use it to help with homework essays. Locating and researching, even going to different countries, even different continents is possible to do on the computer. You can buy plan tickets. reserve rooms, even reserve tables at resturants in different countries by just a few clicks. Another thing is, you can research countries, towns, and cities with google instead of having to go out and get books. Reading about and talking to people from different countries is always an option. Being able to talk. and read about people and go to countries just by a clicking a button is pretty amazing. Computers also allow us to talk and communicate to people when there is no other way. The computers give people the ability to talk and see people they they the would never communicate with anymore. An example of this is my father hadn't see his father since he was two, but he started communicating with him and we were able to see him and chat with him through web chat. So these web chatting websites; ooVoo, facebook, myspce, skype, etc, is allowing people to reconnect. This advantage is allowing friendships and relationships to continue, is that really bad? Computers can help people with their homework and essays. For instint, they can type and print their essays instead of having to write it on paper. This helps because first it makes their, it also can be changed quicker and easier. They also can get information about what they are studying quickly and more efficiently. Instead of searching for a word in a big dictionary they can use an online dictionary and just have to type in the word. Online dictionary also have prounociation help and different langages. This helps so much so they can get their work done and exercise, enjoy nature, or interact with family and friends. I hope you will take my opinion seriously and think about it is using computers for daily needs really that bad?
11	The topic that is on many minds in our country is, &quot;Are computers beneficial, or harmful to our students?&quot; @CAPS1 have evolved from dosktop computers, and before that, type writers, but have they gone too far? While the blank screen of a computer @MONTH1 distract some, the benefits defin out weigh the bads in a situation like this. Being able to have faster research, easier communicating and computers in wartime are great capabilitys of the modern computer. Also, due to advancement in technology, computers are very helpful because they help @LOCATION4 with our daily lifes. Many doubts about the computer exist, but the computer can surpass all of them. In a time crunch situation like college or high school, speed is everything. Computers allow students to research faster, and with more accuracy by being able to search for key words. Before, students would have to do the painstaking process of searching in books. More times than not, they wouldn't find what they were looking for, but with the modern age, students can get the information they need fast. Also, having computers in the classroom helps so that teachers can get the info they need for an upcoming class. If speed is what you need, then you will look for a computer. Besides speed, computers also give you another great thing, communication. With emails, @CAPS2's, @CAPS3, @CAPS4, and blogs, knowing what your friends are doing later is just a click away! This is much easier than calling the person. Also having this access to friends can help when one moves away. If you miss a long lost friend or cousin, just search their name, and you can talk to them! Having friends so close by you can really make every life great. Out in @LOCATION3 or @LOCATION1, solgiers rely on computers for valueable information; such as radar, or robots. Having computers do the &quot;dirty work&quot; can help in times of war, and can save valuable lives. Not having these computers would mean certain death for some people in the @LOCATION4 armed forces. Computers some times take the place of humans in things such as @ORGANIZATION1's, or unmaned airieal vehical and some many lifes too. Weather it be facebook or bombings, computers help in a vital way. It was @DATE1 and @PERSON1's communist regime was ruling new @LOCATION2. One man stood in front of a tank, resisting to move, showing courage and wanting a democracy. Fortuneatly, this was all caught on film. How was it broadcasted to the world? Using the computer, and internet. Today many people are able to learn about that due to computers. In many ways computers help @LOCATION4 with our daily lives and for most of @LOCATION4, without them, we would be lost.
3	In this story, the cyclist was trying to make it to Yosemite, California. In the begining, the cyclist was sure of himself he decided to ask some old men that looked like they haven't been off their porch since Carter was in office for directions. The old men ended up leading him into the middle of the desert. In the desert, the sun was beating down on him and he had a limited supply of water. There was no sign of civilization what so ever. These hot conditions made the cyclist very hot, tired, and very thirsty. But that didn't stop him, he kept going and eventually he came apon a little town where he could drink cool water and take a well needed rest. 
2	Through most the story, the features of the setting affect the cyclist in a more negative way. For instance, he makes it to this town a guy swore was there, but it turned out to be abandoned. So he let out a sad, hopeless laugh and still had energy to feel sorry for himself. Another feature was the Grape Juice Factory, also abandoned, so he hung his head and that blues tune “summer time” rattled in his brain. A third feature was his thirst. So he stuck some pepples in his mouth to take his mind off it. Then he thought about how lucky he’d be if he checked, @CAPS1 negative to me.
1	The features from the essay affect the cyclist in many was because he is getting field, and is drinking more and more water. The raods are getting rough so he needs to slow down. If he slows down he will get tierd and need more water although he is all out on top of that the old men really didnt know what they were talking about the features affect the cyclist.
1	The setting affected the cyclist in many ways, for example, the heat was unberable beating down on him during this long ride. The fact that he had no where around him to fill up his water bottle. So he was deing of thirst and he didn’t know where he was going or how far he had to go. The setting was crushal in this story.
2	The setting in the begining of the story is flat an easy but as the path becomes unfamiliar it turns into many hills &amp; turns. This effects the cyclist a lot because he was low on water &amp; was begining to become dehydrated.
1	The setting affects the cyclist. He starts to see things that will affect his mind. Passing there is rolling around him he starts to feel abandoned and misled because there are no signs is going to right way.
2	The cyclist has to over come a lot of obstacles. For example, there is a snake in his path, so he cationly rides around it. Also, there are alot of hills and he wasn’t sure if he could make it up those hills. Furthermore, he is almost out of water so he could die of heatstroke or dehidration. In conclusion he over comes these obsticles and achieves his goal. 
2	In the essay “Rough Road Ahead” the author goes through many seneries. All of the places that the author goes to make him even more determined because he wants to find water and he just wants to get to Yosemite. The determination pushes him to keep going further and further. And then the determination finally pays off after he goes around a turn because he then see’s a place where he can get something to drink and a place to cool down.
2	The features of this setting effect the author while he is cycling. They changed his hope to doubt. There were no buildings or cars, which led him to believe he would never get to Yosemite. Also, it had a rough terrain that made him doubt that he would ever get water. Im sure if the setting had buildings, people, even just civilization, then the cyclist would of been fine.
2	Blazing tempitures, lack of water, dwinding hope-all are the parts of the setting that affect the cyclist. Blazing tempitures, because the hotter the water was the more perspiration and lack of hydration was appointment you can’t put anything back in your skin and your body can’t function without water finally dwinding . Hope, the cyclist didn’t think he was going to live through this. He tried hard and pushed himself and success was made. He lived.
8	In present day, most people live on the computer. Whether if for work or pleasure, everyone uses a computer. In a recent study, researchers determined that an average person spends @NUM1 years of his or her life on the comptuer. Thats a total of @NUM1 years of life waste. Most kids spend all day on the computer on @CAPS1, facebook, @CAPS2, and youtube. They could be using that time to be around family and friends making memories. Kids dont realize how short life is, they should be hiking, camping, spending time with friends and family. I think years from now when kids grow into adults, they will be looking back and regretting not spending more time with there family, or not taking opportunities to explore the world we live in. Instead, they will be looking back and thinking about the halarious video on youtube that got over one million hits. Also, as you @MONTH1 know child obesety is on the rise, they are more overweight kids then there are then and healthy. If a you look back to the times before computers, you will notice that you will rarely see an overweight child. The computer is to blame for this new pamedemic. Kids should be outdoors playing sports and getting fresh air. I bet that if computers were taken away for @NUM3 year, then the changes in health would be drastic. Kids would be alot healtheir and have lost the weight I hope that everyone can see the harms of the computer by reading this, and they will get rid of this poisiness object. 
1	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because he get tiring. The character, in the story is ridding his bike for a long period of time and he gets tired. He rides alone with nothing or none around his accept the tries and wild animals.
1	The features of the cyclist is rough because of the hills, snakes, heat, amount of water. The hills give you a breeze going down but going up give you a hard time. The snakes can hurt you by bitting. The heat could make you sick. The amount of water can really hurt you by being dehydrated.
1	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in several ways. The features of the setting affect the cyclist through the posted speed. Due to how the setting is the cyclist have a rough hill with wish.
1	The hills and bumpy road slow him down, and he is dehydrated. That is also slowing him down because he needs water. There are obsticles in the road too, such as, the big snake laying across the middle of the road. He is lost without water and could possibly die of an heatstroke.
1	Knew what he was getting himself into so if he needed water or nething like that, it was probly his own falt he should have brought some with him.
3	The cyclist and his journey in Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed limit were impacted by the setting. The “deserts of California in June” caused him to be weary very easily. The terrain change from the flat road to hills made him feel less confident because he felt the road sign was taunting him by saying DO NOT Exceed 55 mph. He could only go @NUM1. Finally, the large snake created an obstacle for him by blocking the majority of pavement in front of the cyclist. All of these features affected the cyclist in some way.
0	The story is basically talking about more people with cars should ride bicycles to work or to school’s so it want be alot of polution in the air.
2	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. The temperature in the area affect the way he drinks his water which leads him to thinking he is going to die because he is running out of water. The “towns” he comes to are so deserted he thinks he is going in the wrong direction. All the settings in the story also help him not to give up but keep on going. In conclusion even though he had to go through all that doubt he was going to be alive in the end he still went on and tried. In the end he did make it and all it was worth it.
2	There are many setting that affect the cyclist. One feature would be the terrain around him. Also, the obstacles faced by the cyclist. Another feature would be the types of wild animals &amp; scarceness of water around . Also, the old man who gave him unimportant &amp; non-updated information. All of these would affect the cyclist because it would  wear &amp; fear on his physical &amp; mental strengths.
3	I think that there were many things contributing to the cyclists state at the end of the story. First, there was the fact of time. He was cycling in June which is very hot due to it is summer. Second, he was cycling through California which is warm even in early @DATE1. And third he was traveling through the deserts. So if you put all of that together. He was cycling on a hot June day in the deserts of California. These @NUM1 things all contributed to the characters state. He went through dead towns in his search for water and found an old well pump with extremely hot water, that tasted like battery acid. He drank to much water at the begining which left him with just spit toward the end. He was lucky to find a fish camp in the middle of nowhere and to have found water. The three things made him drink too much water at first and barely left him with enough.
6	Dear Newspaper, @CAPS1 you @MONTH1 know a lot of people now a days are constintly on the computer, and many people think it’s a problem. Well you should know the computer is helpful in many ways, such @CAPS1 learning, entertainment, and even weight. That is just a few out of the hundreds of different things there is to do. The computer can help you get in contact with realitives you haven't seen in a long time. Or maybe if you have been having some health problems you can go online to see what is wrong, I remember my mom has been getting really dizzy and sick, and her doctor told her everything was fine, but in wasen't. So my mom checked up what was wrong on the computer and found out she had a disease, and when she went back to the doctors they figured out she really did and her on a medicine. In my opinion the computer was on of the best inventions made. It can be used for so many things, you can also purchase items over the computer. So now I hope you agree with my opinion and support the use of computer's.
1	The features affects the setting of the cyclist because in some ways they through you off a little with others lines and then will get confused of what their acually talking about. The littlest thing that could through you off is the line when it says before the last world war. That kind off through me off alittle.
1	The setting that were affecting the cyclist was the lack of water he had because it says “the water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips,&quot; and the text also says &quot; I’ld read once that sucking on stones helps take your mind off thirst by allowing the spit to circulate” he wouldn’t be trying to get his mind off of thirst if he wasn’t thirsty.
1	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because it was June and the cyclist had little water. The cyclist was dehydrated and couldn’t find any building or water for many miles. The cyclist took advice from oldtimers which didn’t know what they were talking about. In conclusion, the weather and the location affected the cyclist.
2	The cyclist pedaled through all types of different terrain. Through   hills, high desert, flat roads and the woods. This cyclist took the advice of bunch old men who thought they knew a short cut to the Yosemite national park. This short cut turned out to be a nightmare. The cyclist had only brought so many water bottles and was quickly drinking them all. The setting of this story changed a lot making the cyclist at   times have to pedal faster and slowes. The cyclist was quickly worn out and started to loose hope in himself. The  terrain kept changing making it  hard for him not to be thirsty. Eventually he drank all of his water and knew he would die of dehydration or a heat stroke. As he came up over a long hill he saw a bait store and stopped inside to have a drink vowed not to listen to a bunch of old guys again.
1	The features of the setting make him happy because he meets some people that tell him of a route that will take a lot of time off his trip. This is what the text says, “what I shouldn’t have done was let them have a peck at my map. Like a foolish youth, the next morning I followed their advice and launched out at first light along a “shortcut” that was to slice away hours from my ride.&quot; He also talks about not talking directions from old timers. This is when the text says,”
2	During the cyclist journey to Yosemite many things got in his way and slowed him down. For example, he listened to the old men who gave him wrong directions to where he wanted to go. Also, his water supply was getting low which drained his energy alot quicker than usual. The heat also played a part of his energy loss. The heat made him sweat perfusely which made the water that was in his body be of no use.    
2	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways.For example, he was in the california desert in June.The heat and lack of water can cause people to become dehydrated,passout or even die.There are not many sources of water in the deserts.The terrain didn’t help him much either, hills use a lot of energy and  made him perspore,causing him to lose flood from his body. The cyclist was greatly affected by the features of the setting.
2	The rider in the story “Rough Road Ahead” by Joe Kurmaskie has a very analyzing mind, which is affected by things around him. At first, the rider “rode into the morning...with a smile” because of the bright sun, and the “cool pines” and rushing rivers”...he is very confident with the old mens directions, this first sign of disapointment is when he comes to the “ramshackle shed...” And the “...sight of this was troubling...” to him, but he rode on. He thinks as he rides over the “crippling hills” that maybe this wasn’t such a great idea. Finally he comes to a old bait shop, and the “modern bathroom” that he enters to drink from, gives him relief from the desert he had just been riding through.
1	The features of the setting affected the cyclist a great deal. The landscape was hard to ride on, there was intense heat &amp; little water. As a result, it was a long trip and he had a difficult time reaching his destination.
1	At first the trip was easy going and flat. It was a nice day out and the water sapply was draining. Soon, the path became hills and soon got rough. Even though the pines gave shade it wasn’t enough to help the cyclist. Eventually he reached some what civilization after enduring a grueling climb and by cycle trip through the woods.
8	Dear Newspaper, @CAPS1 you see, owning a computer can effect you. Having a computer can make you have lazy behavier, can @CAPS2 you from being indoors, and can @CAPS2 you inside so you dont hang out with family and friends. Everyone loves having a computer, but have you ever thought what it can do to you? Spending all day or even half your day on the computer will make you lazy. When your lazy or becoming lazy you dont want to do anything, and without doing anything you can become overweight. So, you need exersize because it's good for you and exersizing can protect you from health problems such @CAPS1 diebities. Get off your computer, and go for a walk. Why would anyone want to be indoors on a computer when you can go enjoy what nature posses. Being so drawn to your computer can @CAPS2 you indoors instead of breathing fresh, clean air which is outside. Being outside can be lots of fun too. You can go swimming or even have a picnic in your local park. When your outside you can also see all the breathtaking scenery, wild animals, and exotic plants and flowers that live among us. If you just go outside for atleast an hour a day you'll see fore sure how much better it is than being on a computer. Staying on the computer for too long can @CAPS2 you from what realy matters, your friends and family. Why talk on the internet to a friend when you can meet up with them and do something fun? Friends and family are realy important and if you don't spend time with them they can become upset. Being with friends and family are supposed to be the best moments of your life, so dont spend them on the computer. Go call up a friend and do something fun, I hope by now you understand that being on the computer or having one is not the best idea. Having a computer can make you lazy, @CAPS2 you from enjoying nature, and can have you not spend time with family and friends. If everyone got off the computer for at least a hour a day they'll live a happier, healthier life. So, turn off your computer get off your couch, and enjoy your life.
1	The essay on &quot;Rough Road Ahead&quot; is about the dangers of speed and assault. It’s just letting you know to follow instructions and read signs. You should always keep close @NUM1/= out for signs and things.  
2	Setting that affected the cyclist was water tempeter, rolling hills and condition of the roads. Water was a factor because he need cool water to keep him hydrated he came to a shed with pumps after running out of water. He started pumping the water it was hot but he took it he tried to let it cool down but it didn’t. Rolling hills was another a tender to the cyclist hardships because the road started off flat then ended up in hills going up his can strain the leg and makes it harder to keep riding. Another hardship was road condition, it was smooth at frist then it became rough and rocky. Those was some affects the cyclist had to over come
2	Setting  depends on how you can go or move. The town hills helped the cyclist. The up hills didn’t. The cyclist  got a bad idea or aditude when he saw the towns he was upset and mad he didn’t want to die and yet he though. He was going two. He said he wouldn’t trust old men anymore. They didn’t know where were talking about .How and why did he trust even in the first place.
3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways.For example, &quot;I noticed the terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.&quot; This quote shows that his surroundings were giving him diffuculty and a challenge for his travel. By describing the hills as &quot;rolling&quot; it helps the reader imagine the obstacles he was going through. Also, the sign that read, &quot;Rough Road Ahead; Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit.&quot; gives the reader a feeling that the character is in danger. Lastly an example of the setting that helps shows the charcters hardships is, &quot;no one in sight, not a building, car or structure of any hand.&quot; If anything were to the happen to the character, as the author was foreshadowing, he'd be stranded and all alone to die. He'd be in trouble and there would be no one to help him. If the author did not use these examples, the reader would not easily get a picture of the troubles he had to overcome. In conclusion these examples added emphasise and meaning to the text.   
1	Well the features of the setting affects the cyclist is a lot of ways. Well when his water was is hot to drink He got some pebbles and stuck them, in his mouth. He had heard somewhere that if you do that it will dilute your spit. The terrain of the story was very rocky and hilly. Those are the features of the terrain.
2	The features of the setting affect the cyclist. The hills afected the cyclist because they would be harder for him to ride The abandoned town also affected him. When he got to the town he was hoping he could get more water and take a break but when he got there the town was abandoned. Also the highway was hard for him because it would be hard for him to ride on. Also there was nowhere that he could get water around him. Many features of the setting affected him.
3	The features of the setting gradually contribute to the cyclist’s anger. For example, at the beginning of the story, the cyclist comes across poisonous snakes, “one ramshacke shed, several rusty pumps, and a corral that couldn’t hold in the lamest mule.” All of sights trouble the narrator, and he starts to becom frightened and neurotic. As he cycles on, the narrator begins to deplete his water supply, and when he stops to restock, “the water wouldn’t cool down” and “it had the flavor of battery acid. The cyclist’s lack of water frustrates him, and the increasing steepness of the hills adds to his annoyance. The final straw came when the cyclist passed by what he thought “had been a Welch’s Grape Juice Factory.” The narrator goes on in an outrage to explain that hopes to die out on the road, in order to spare himself from the dreaded features of the setting.  
3	The features in the setting most definetly affect the cyclist while he travels. The cyclist is incredibly thirsty and tired and the setting he’s placed in just gives him no hope of survival really. He first comes to a “ghost town” where he finds no one is living. This first encounter with isolation in a desolute place doesn’t really affect him because it is the first place he finds but the rest of the storys setting comes to mimic this. As he travels he is met with barren land, no water and no people in sight. It’s June in California and the cyclist fears he @MONTH1 soon suffer from heat stroke if he doesn’t find water yet. It doesn’t help when he comes to an abandoned juice factory that taunts him with the one thing he needs to survive. All in all the features in the setting make the cyclist lose hope, make him feel like he will die if he dosen’t find water.
2	The setting in the story “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” was based in the hot, and dry terrain of California. This setting affected the character mood. It did this because some of its included feature can seem as actual metaphorically based moods. An example from the story is, “The cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite...” this quote from the story could suggest the tone and the mood of the scenery which would be calm, and relaxed. So from the scene that is being seen and the mood it has would also give the character its mood.
2	The features of the setting that affect cyclist depends where they are located. In this story the feeling on “nothing and the desert around him and the heat gave him no hope”. It all depends on where you are cycling. “It didn’t really matter I was going to die.” This quote states his feelings on what was going on through his head while he was dieing of thirst. He felt nothing he was sure he was going to die until he found a sign of civilization that was near and he became better and his hope was raised.
9	Technology has been growing and changing rapidly. Just look at apples new @CAPS1, a desent rized touch screen computer. Computers have been rapidly changing too. But I think that @CAPS2 need to cut down on the use of electronics. Being one the computer for a long time and large amount of time can damage your eyesight, give you arthrightus and takes time @CAPS5 of exersizing; one of the thing manhy @CAPS2 need to do. Many @CAPS2 have been spending has too long on the computer, although it can be very useful it can also be very damaging to your eyesight many people spent large amounts of time staring at the computer screen. If you stair at something for too long it can damage your eyesight and make it worse because your trying @CAPS5 your eye lens. Also the lighting from the computer is very hurtful to your eyes. The light coming on to your eyes is like staring at the sun but not quit as damaging. The sun will instatntly damage your eyes while overtime a computer slowly damges your eyesight. If your eyesight is already damaged a computer will worsen it. The more time spent on a computer the more you damage your vision. Since your eyes are already bad you might think &quot;well they can't get any worse.&quot; @CAPS5 the truth is they can not only is the light and the amount of time spent during a being onthe computer damaging to people with @NUM1 vision but even more damaging to people without. can be genetic or common to people who constently their knuckles. It can also be common to people who spend exeessive amount of time on the computer. AIM is very popular to people of all ages. Its a way to instantly gossip or chat with freinds. But it takes alot of typing. Typing to long or to much can cause your fingers to lock up and it harder for your bones to move over your joints without pain. if this constenity happens to you you could be a canidat for arthrightus. No letting your fingers take a break can also be one of the reasons your fingers hurt, if you never let them take a break they can also lock up and it can be very painful. You should spend less time on the computer if you don't want artrightus. Because of all this new technology less @CAPS2 go outside and play or hit the gym and exersize. That @MONTH1 be way many @CAPS2 are over weight. Being on the computer for to long takes away time you could use to exersize or get some fresh air.
1	I think the features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. It being a long, hot, lonely ride there, had an effect on him. It scared him which made him go longer. He had nothing to drink and thought he was going to die it made him weak. The snake in the way caused him longer and every stop that had once there effected him to.
1	I would think even riding a bike for so long can be bad for the behind. But also good exercising especially for the legs all the strength you get from the muscle. To know where you going could take forever. But I do know what they would have to face all types of weather, but as long as you have gear on no harm could come to you.
1	At first he was mad because he took advise from old men who never left their porch. He got scared he was going to die because had he drunk all his water and he didn’t know how long it would be till he got some more. He shouldn’t have drank his water so quickly knowing he had a while to go. Then he became happy when he saw the bait sign. He biked quickly down the hill.  
2	The features of the setting affect the cyclist, in the story Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit, in many ways. The cyclist is affected because the setting is depressing and frightening. When the cyclist first sees the speed limit sign of 55 mph, he says, “Sometimes life can be so cruel”. Because he can only go 12 mph considering he's on a bike. After seeing the sign, a snake crosses his path. He’s frightened by it because it looked like a diamond back and he was trying to keep his balance and ease past it. Since the main problem the cyclist is faced with is the lack of water, the dry, long hills seem to make him more weak and tired. Tumble weeds crossed past him and there was no water in sight That is how the features of the setting affect the cyclist.
1	The features of the setting affected the cyclist greatly. It made him become dehydrated. For example, in paragraph @NUM1 sentence @NUM2 he stated “I eased past, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state.” This shows how the heat and climate of the setting affected him by how he was getting thrown off balance and wears     to him getting dehydrated. The setting of the story “Do not exceed posted speed limit,” by Joe Kurmaskie, effects the cyclist in the story.
3	The setting in this story greatly affects the cyclist. It is an extremely hot now in California while the narrator in aiding his ride. This causes him to become delighted much faster while he is on a “Short hit” leading to no where. ”Wide signs of dried outcast winded my limb, and the growing realization that I could drop from ?? a gorgeous day in June” This gust shows how that calm day really was and the fact the cyclist is sweating so much shows how much the weather is affecting him. The rolling hills in the story also affect the cyclist. By cycling towards up and down no often, it secured his journey. It cowed him to the side even longer in getting to a town with water.The deserted knowns in the setting are negatively also affected the narrator. It gave him a hopeless narration because there was no place to stop and depleting his water supply.
3	Joe Kurmaskie had a rough time trying to get to Yosemite National park. First, he received directions from an old man, Joe followed these instructions; little did he know that he would be headed for many hardships. After he reached the first town he checked his supply. About @NUM1 more miles he reliced his bottle was getting low because he was travelling through the high deserts of California. It is hot cool out there,then the terrain changed. He no longer had that much water. He ran into a snake, which he swore was a alamond back. Finally, he came to another town, got some water and then left after going through ghost towns. Riding in conditions that are hot and unfamiliar are hard to do. Adding hills to heat is not a good combination, with nothing around val it can be very dangerais, even fatal. Before you bike thinkof what conditions are ahead of you
1	because he was telling to make it wirte he nite to go and he much it because he was drieing to soil and because he was drieing 55 mph pert hour and 12 mph and sometime life can feel so cruel in life ya dig and that ia all I can said right now.
2	Each time the author comes to a point where the setting isn’t very appealing or helpful, he loses hope for reaching his destination or finding a nice place to rest and get some fresh water. For example, the text states, “one ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a corral that couldn’t hold in the lamest mule greeted me. This sight was troubling” (Kurmaskie @NUM1). The author has a sort of negative, sarcastic tone at this point. This shows that he’s getting frustrated and losing some hope. He also mentions that the “sight was troubling” which shows how big of an affect the features around him or scenery can have.
1	Lots of features in the setting play an affect on cyclist. Some that @MONTH1 play an affect are the heat, flat road that’s had to ride on, or how there
7	I tink that a computer is a good idea because when people are online they like to talk to there family and see them by the video cam. When you dont want to go out or your just go online and pay us . Like would you like to be no because when you watching a movie that you like your be like oh &quot; go clean your room&quot; and you go like &quot;oh wait this movie is good.&quot; The computer are the best system for go online every body use computer. Witout computer how you going to cheak your yahoo @CAPS1. My moom love to be on @CAPS2. How you going to check your message if u dont know have a computer. If they lake computers out of sle every body is going to try to make one. and the people from walmart is going to be like they making more money than me llike the people from but buy they got good computers. no one is to make people to get people offline. Apple store have when people go over and buy some computers. When they be spending all the time on the is because they like to be online. If i like onlie you are not going to take the computers and say u searching mor in the computer. But is all bout computers when your mom is all ways at your house boring do go bu a computer whne you get money.
1	This essay is an american tale that express how hard it is to do someing. But do it thought determination. The cycle are faced with many change not onnly physically but also menataly. There was no one in sight not a building  or anything. As this rider come to think that the sabstatal beating he took from the ride he is tirde and no sight of baidi say he might not be able to do it.
3	The features of the setting greatly affect the cyclist. First of all he is travelling through a desert in California in June so the weather is extremely hot and the cyclist needs water, however as he is running out of the water he brought along with himself, he cannot find any other water himself so he is thirsty and almost dehydrated. Also, if frustrates him that when he finds water, not only is it hot it tastes like battery acid @CAPS1, when the cyclist decides to conserve some of his water and go to the next town to get more water, but there is another setback. The condition of the road is so poor, that the cyclist cannot go more that 12 mph. Thus, if he ever reaches the next town. he still will have to wait longer for the much needed water, travelling at 12 mph. The snake is also another setback that the cyclist was fortunately able to escape. Thus his major concern is the lack of water.
1	The features of the setting affected the cyclist in many different ways. At first it was a bright shiny day and the cyclist was happy. He reaches the first town which is a ghost town and it makes him sad. Riding on he begins to lose water. The once bright shiny day began to beat the heat down on the cyclist. He reached a ramshackle shed and began to lose hope. He loses water quickly and becomes more dehydrated. The terrain become slopes and hills and the ride become harder, when he reached the grape drink factory his hopes were almost gone. But just over the hill was a fishing shop. He used his reining energy to speed down the hill to get water and get his energy back. 
1	The features of the setting, affect the cyclist in many ways. For example, when it says, “The cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite had my name written all over them.” The features of this setting are making the cyclist determined. Another example, is when it says, &quot;At some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake – it really did look like a diamondback blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me.&quot; The features of the setting are making him brave and couragious. The last example is when it says, “I hung my head.” The features of this setting are making the cyclist have despair. That is how the features of the setting affect the cyclist.
1	In the essay “Rough road ahead do not exceed posted speed limit,” the cyclist is affect both positivly and negativly by the setting. Setting is the sounding in which the story tacks place. In the story a cyclist loses his way and band is put in to dangous because of it. The setting of the story can be dicrided as mountainous with many rolling hills. The author discride the setting by say “@CAPS1 two miles in to the next section of the ride, I noticed the terrain changing.” The change in terrain made it more difical for the cyclist. However he also used the land to give him hope that he was almost their. He told him self that he’d make it if he make it over the next hill. The setting of the story gave the cyclist hope and problems in his journy to sarive.
3	The cyclist was affected by the fact that he took advice from some old men who’s information was not accurate. Then he cycled along the desert which was very hot. He had a limited supply of water and that also affected him in a very bad way. He almost had a heat stroke a few times. He was probably angry that he took these men’s advice and got himself into this. Then when he found the fish camp, he was overjoyed with relief. But at the same time, if he had asked someone else for directions, he would not have been in this situation in the first place. So it’s really confusing because he probably felt relived and mad at the same time. And then the other old man asked him did he know the best way there. He was right to say yes because if he didn’t, the old man would have gave him some more messed up direction and he would have been out there again, about to have another heat stroke.
0	The features of the setting affects the cyclist by rush he /she got when speeding down the hill. The fresh morning air, no limits just you and your feet. Speeding, going as fast as you can with your heart pounding in your chest. No boundarys, when you can go where you like, when you like. No people to get in the way of you and your need for speed.
3	In the short story Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit it is shown that the features of the setting do affect the cyclist through the story. In the story the cyclist is faced with the mental and physical journey he takes while riding his bike. Being unware of where he is on his journey the setting begins to really affect him. For example as he keeps making his journey he is affected by the old towns and desert places he even says that &quot;The sight was troubling.&quot; As he continues to California in June the heat and the long journey really began to affect him both mentally and physically. For example he says, &quot;I got down my hands and knew working the hands of the rusted water pump with all my strength.&quot; The quote shows because he is biking so long is looking water and there is not a town is sight he becomes weak and although he is at terminated to make it through this journey he is becoming more hopeless and sorry for himself because of the setting he is placed in. 
2	“@CAPS1 directions, June, lack of water” all are elements that effect the rider on his ride. He took directions from older people who promised the rider a short cut. I turned out that their short cut was wrong. When the rider went on this trip, it was June in California. It would have been burning hot. Lastly he had drank most of his water during the trip. He could have died if he didn’t find the other water source. These were some elements that effected the rider on his trip.
2	The feature of the setting greatly affect the cyclist in “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit.” The features in the story changed the speaker’s mood throughout his journey. For example, in the beginning he came across a deserted town so he was cautious. Next, he came across a fork in the road which was troubling to him. Then he passed a snake and had the obstacles of the hills which made him become determined. Finally, his determination changed to relief where he reached Gary and Wilber’s fish camp. In conclusion, the setting in the story greatly affects the cyclist by changing his moods and attitude towards his journey.
8	Dear @CAPS1 @ORGANIZATION2, I believe that computers have a positive affect on people who use them. Because they teach hand eye coordination, give us the ability to learn about far away people and places and allow us to chat online with people. @CAPS3 first reason of why I think computers have a positive affect on people is that they teach hand eye coordination. For example, we need to use our hand-eye coordination skills when we type to @CAPS2 the letters. This helps us increase our Hand eye coordination because it helps us think about what letters we are typing, @CAPS2 the letters on the keyboard, and push them. Also when we type long passages it increase our hand eye coordination becaue we get used to wrighting the long paragraphs and we become more familiar with where the letters are on the keyboard and our speed increases,which means we can get more work done in a shorter time. Believe it or not @PERSON1 free of the @ORGANIZATION1 hospital took a survey that showed @NUM1 people who type essays instead of wrighting them by hand, have a greater hand eye coordination skill. Computers also allow us to learn about far away people and places. For example computers make it easier to reaserch far away people and places. Useing a computer can help us understand and learn about people and places withought a trip to the library. Also computers allow us to @CAPS2 us to @CAPS2 more info about recent events that have just around the world. Also computers make it faster to reserch topics because looking for a book in those big libraries can be stressfull, not to mention dificult. Also informat on a computer can never be checked out or not availible like library books. Lastly you have information right at our fingerries so you will never have to leave youre house, @CAPS3 last reason is that computers allwo us to chat online with other people. This can help us because it allows us to talk to friends and family from around the world. Also it helps us talk to our parents if theyre away or if you're on a camping trip. Chating on a computer is a great way to make friends with people you dont know and block people you dont want talking to you. So in a sence you can be in controll of your friendships and who youre friends with. Computers are the greatist advance in technology sence the wheel and they have helped so many people.
1	In the essay, “Rough Road Ahead: Do not exceed posted speed Limit,” is about a man that follows some bad directions and in the middle of a desert is stuck without water. He starts to lack confidence in the directions when the setting changes. He said, “After fourty miles into the pedal, I arrived at the first town it fit the traditional definition of ghost town.” He had been told this was a thriving town but was left with nothing. This was a big let down and the cyclist wasn’t so positive this had been the right choice. He keeps on riding and finds another dissetling sight.” One ramshacle shed, several rusty pumps, and a corral that wouldn’t  hold in the lamest of mule greeted me.“ @CAPS1 was another place said to be good but all he got was battery flavored water. On the last strech of his bike met with rough rolling hills, a diamondback looking snake, and an abandoned juice factory. All of this brang his spirits lower and lower until he thought he would die. The cyclist ended up finding a store but he was discauraged by the environment he was in a hot and could have died.
3	In the essay, the cyclist is greatly affected by the features of the setting. Under the conditions he could barely survive and make it to his destination. It is clear that the features of the setting are affecting him when he states,“The speed limit was 55 mph. I was doing a water-depleting 12 mph. Sometimes life can be so cruel.” In his efforts he is slowly getting weaker and the sign he sees only makes him feel worse because it seems to him that it mocking him. He also states, “I’d read once that sucking on stones helps take your mind off thirst by allowing what spit you had left to circulate. With any luck I’d hit a bump and ledge one in my throat.” This shows he is ready to give up completely and wouldn’t care if he died. From the author’s tone, it is clear that the features of the setting do affect the cyclist.
2	Features of the setting such as the hot sun, no water, and “Gary and Wilber’s Fish Camp,” greatly affected the cyclist. Since the cyclist was traveling through the high desserts of California in June, the temperature was really high and the hot sun left “wide rings of dried sweat” on his shirt and made the cyclist realize that he could drop from a heatstroke. Also, the fact that the only water around felt “somewhere in the neighborhood of two-hundred degrees” and “had the flavor of battery acid” prevented the cyclist from drinking it and put him in a “dehydrated state.” @CAPS1, “Gary and Wilber’s Fish Camp” affected the cyclist by solving his problem of dehydration, since there was cold water availible for him upon arrival.
2	The features of the setting affects the cyclist in many ways. First of all, if the cyclist didn’t listen to the old man, he would have never gone through this trouble. Also being that he didn’t have enough water when he went on riding, caused him to be real dehydrated. He should of turned back as soon as he ran out of water. Plus the heat made him real hot and thirsty. He should know how to never trust any strangers and try things on his own.
2	The features of the setting effect the cyclist .The setting makes him feel thirsty, dry, hot, and lost. In the story the setting plays a big party in the cyclist's will to ride to the next town. First the cyclist asks directions from a guy that never left his house in decades this creates, doubt. Also in the story it says “Tumbleweeds cross my path” this makes the cyclists feel lost. Finally it say the “water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips.” This makes the cyclist thirsty and tired. The features definatly have an effect on the cyclists.
2	In the story “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” the cyclist is affected by the setting in many different ways. He was biking in the middle of the summer in a very hot state of California. This affects him because he is sweating and he is running out of water and he could possibly become dehydrated. The roads are very hilly so, he has to use alot more energy to get up the hills. That’s why I think the cyclist is extremely affected by the setting in the story “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed.”   
2	The cyclist had to deal with some tough terrain throughout his ride. First, he was in the “high deserts of California in June.” @CAPS1 usually brings a picture to my mind of a very dry, hot place. The cyclist had trouble finding water he needed, and thought he might die of heatstroke in the conditions. Also, there were hills. The cyclist said he had to ride over “one long, crippling hill.” From my experiences as a cyclist, hills are the worst part, especially if you’re thirsty. The climate in this story was very hot and dry, and the terrain was full of hills, so altogether, that would make one bad bike ride.
1	Snake, heat, hills-all are what the biker had to deal with because of certain settings. He had to deal with a diamond back. He was going through the desert so it was like @NUM1 degrees. While he was biking he had to go up crippling hills. He had a redicuious setting to have to bike with. I would never be able to do what he did.
1	The cyclist had alot of problems with his setting. It was very hot and he started getting low on water. This caused him to become dehydrated. There was hardly any civilization so no one could come to his aid. Also, the path he decided to take was long and vigorous.
3	In the story “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit”, written by Joe Kurmaskie, the author describes the setting as hot, tiresome, and aqusting. You get this picture from the author when the bikerider is describing his surroundings. The bikerider describes his as the high desserts of California in June, being hot and musky, ruff terrain, etc. This gives you an image of what the bike rider feels physically and emotionally. This image shows how tired, thirsty, and determined the bikerider really is. Using words, metaphors, and imagery the author puts you in the shoes of the bikerider emotionally and physically.
9	Dear, @CAPS1 paper @CAPS2 The computers we have do benefits our society, because it makes people smarter, it's a way to talk to people who live far from where you live, and it's a great way to do homework if you still in school. Having a computer is a great way to get you smarter.You could go on diffrent websites to help you learn what your stuck on in school. I remember the time I was having trouble in math, so my teacher gave me this website called a @ORGANIZATION1. It goes over on waht you need help on, and you get a live tutor. The computer could teach babies how to talk. It taught my cousin how to talk and he's @NUM1 @NUM1/2 years old. Isn't that amazing on that computers can do. Next I will talk about how computers are a great resource to talk to far away people you @MONTH1 know. When you have computers you could talk to people that live across the @LOCATION1 woudn't you want to talk to somebody long distance without paying extra money on your cell-phone? I remember one time I was talking to my dad cause I had no minuts on my phone and it went great talking to him on the computer. Having a computer is kind of like a bigger cellphone. You could talk to a family or a friend if you or they don't have a phone. Lastly, I will talk about how you could do homework. Having a computer you could do a lot of homework. Last time I was on my computer I had to find out about @PERSON1 for math, so I typed his name and his biography came so I wrote about him. You could use it for all subjects especially language arts you could type up papers and look up diffrent things you had to do in class. Would you want to write a @NUM3 page essay and makin your fingers cramp up just writing no. so you just go on the computer and type it up without cramping your fingers @CAPS3 reconsider your opinion, cause computers can get you smarter, talk far away people and help you with homework.
1	The features of the setting affect the cyclist by the people around the area of @LOCATION1. Taking advice from older people in open landed place can affect the cyclist.
1	In the story “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” By Joe Kurmaskie the settings affected the cyclist by how hard his ride is. When the road was smooth He ride was fast when it was the hills it took him longer to get to the next town.
3	Varias faetures of the setting affect the journey and mooble if the cyclist in the text. The first feature of the setting that affect the cyclist is the desert. He is “traveling through the high deserts of California in June” , and this is making him really thirsty. “[He] had been hitting [his] water bottles pretty regularly “because of this. He later runs out of water, and becomes hopeless. He becomes hopelee because there is no building or establishments anywere in sight. Therefore no water and there isn’t a place to get any water. Another feature of the setting that affects him is the people that gave him directions. They told him abait a shoutcut, and he listened. This through everything off, and he was left with despair. Another feature is the Gary and Wilber’s fish camp.This lead him to sicocss of finding water. This affected his mood because he had hope again. In conlusio, many of the features of the setting affected his mood in many ways.
0	The features of the setting affect the cyclist for many reasons. If the setting is dark trainy, there aren’t going to be ??? running outside. If it is snowing, the ??? are not going to be swimming in the water.
0	That explains how the features of the setting affect the cyclsit. Is because some people don’t care about there features. Every body are working for a good feature but, others they @CAPS1 still from people who work. Everyday to have a new features.
2	In “Do not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” by Joe Kurmaskie, the setting affects the cyclist by making him doubtfull. The cyclist is doubtfull that he won’t make it to Yosemite National Park. &quot;It didn't really matter. I was going to die and the bivas would pick me clean, leaving only some expenses outdoor gear and a diary with the last entry in praise of old men, their wisdom and their keen senses of direction.” This shows how he is doubtful. Finally in the story the cyclist doesn’t think that they will make it.
2	In the passage, the features of the setting affect the cyclist because every time he comes along something different a new idea about his survival comes into his head. First, when the cyclist sees the mule he says, “This sight was troubling,” he is now troubled by the fact that he had not seen a town yet and starting to doubt the old mens advise. Also, when he sees the juice factory he puts some pebbles in his mouth and says, “It didn’t really matter, I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean.” This shows that seeing the broken down juice factory gave him no hope and he tells his self that he will die.
3	In the essay, “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” the setting had a major impact on the character. The cyclist was trying to get to Yosemite National Park, but on the way, he had some troubles, the fact that there was not much civilization affected the cyclist because he was not able to refill his water bottles, so he grew very thirsty. Also, the many hills and the fact that it is summer impacted him greatly because he became tired out more easily and could not pedal as fast. When it says, “A tar like substance oozed out Wouldn’t cool down,” it showed how he wasn’t able to drink. Also, when he passed the grape juice factory, it must have been torture to him since he was so thirsty. If he hadn’t taken the advice of the men in the first place he would have had a much shorter ride and would not have been so exhausted. The setting affected the cyclist a lot in this essay.
2	The cyclist is beginning at what seems a fine idea and place. Then the conditions become hot, dreadful, and maybe sticky. The constant heat without any breeze was getting to the character. Mirages appeared, or so he thought. He actually thought he might die. Not quite an optimistic one is he? “ It didn’t really matter. I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean…” The heat must have been bad, he wasn’t thinking straight and was slowly checking himself into a mental center! Although painful heat was a brilliant way to learn a lesson in cycling, and the old men “helping” with directions.
2	As he began his journey, he had full confidence in the directions given given to him by the old men. After he came to the first town and there was no water, he rode on. After he found an “ramshackle shed” he became troubled , as he “had been “hitting“ his “water bottles regularly“ and was traveling through the “desert of California in June” and was running low on water. Coming to a place where he saw a building over hills, he “manuevered” his way down, only to find it long  deserted and himself close to despair. He was desparate for water he needed it soon. Finally, he came upon “@CAPS1 and Wilber’s Fish Camp” and quenched his thirst, and was relieved. Then on  he wised up, and took no more directions from old men who knew little to nothing about cycling.
10	Dear @ORGANIZATION1, I understand the conterversies between having computers. Computers are the center of technology. I can't imagine a world without them. Though having a computer @MONTH1 cause children to play uneducational games, computers teach more and help children as well. I know for your company, having no computer would be a nightmare. It gives education to not only children, but adults as well. First of all, computers are proven to be the second best source of education, behind school, along with the best source of information. Millions of websites are specified to only education of all kinds. Not only are there websites. these are @CAPS1's with online tutors or just work. Computers provide practically anthing you need. For work, adult use. computers to sell something communicate with someone or just look up a new topic. The technology of a computer is farther than any other item. Without a computer life would be much more difficult. Instend of just sending an email, mail would have to be sent out. Most information would have to from brooks. In fact even the internet has books to buy and read. I am aware that people feel that children are spending too much time on the computer talking to friends, but children need to be social, @CAPS2 it weren't talking on the computer, there would just be more texting and calling. The computer makes life so much easier that to take it away would cause stress and less time for other important activities. Lastly. computers have documents and it is the best way to type. Your company can definetly agree that without typing documents life would be a mess. Everyone writes up documents and needs to send them, open them up again, and edit them. The only other access to typing is a type writer. Types writers can't save anything, delete and do half the work computers do. Your whole job depends on the computer and typing. How would you feel @CAPS2 you couldn't use a computer. In conclusion, computers are a necessity to our living. Without computers life would be difficult and stressful. Computers give education stand information to everyone. The technology is unbelievable and makes everyday life, easier. I couldn't even imagire no documents and typing. I'm sure you will agree with my decision. I hope you chose to inform others with this information. Thank you for your time
3	The features of the setting in the story “DO Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit”, affect the cyclist in the story, in many ways. The first of which would definetly be the lack of water the cyclist had, and the fact that there wasn’t anywhere around for miles. From the text it read “There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind.” This evidence from the text proves to the reader that the cyclist was getting worried. Another part of the setting would be the obvious element of temperature. The cyclist is our in the hot, relentless desert. “Wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June.” The author here, by using the elements of nature, is trying to make the reader concerned/scared for the main character. The final key had to travel and the road conditions. Although the desert is flat, he began to notice some hills in the road, and such a long distance, including the heat, could be deadly. The setting’s elements, greatly effect the cyclist in this story.
2	The cyclit of “Do not exceed posted speed limit”, was greatly affected by the setting of his bike ride, which caused him pain and displeasure. He travels in the high deserts of California in June, which he exaggerates that water there was “@NUM1 degers”. The great heat caused him to drink lots of water, depleting it much quicker than he would’ve wished. It also sopped the energy out of him, further complicating his ride. Along the way there is literally nothing there and he has nowhea  to replenish his water supply. The hilly, rough terrain also calls for hard, tough peddling, sopping even more energy. The heat, terrain, and lack of places to stop combined for an awful ride for the cyclist of this story.
3	The lone biker in “Rough Road Ahead: Do not exceed posted speed limit” by @PERSON1 is strongly affected by the features of the landscape. The sun is the most important factor; it drives him to first consume his water quickly, and then drives him search for a water source.”The sun was beginning to beat down, but I barely noticed it...I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly,” in this quote, it reveals that even though the biker had not acknowledged the sun, his body had required water, depleting his supply in his water bottles. A lack of water feeling two hundred degrees...it had the flavor of battery acid.&quot; The only water that the bike is able to find is not consumable. The most important of the factors, in the matter of survival, is the fish camp that the biker finally reaches. ”I stumbled into a rather modern bathroom and drank deeply from the sink.” The biker had been on the brink of dehydration and the fish camp is where he finally reganed the strength to continue on his journey.
1	Dry, thirsty, tedious-all are features of setting that affect the cyclist. First, everything is dry. The cyclist isnt any where near a town that could help him. He has been pedaling in the heat, outside for a long time. Secondly, He is very thirsty. The way he is travelling is a good sign he is in need of water. He went fourty miles before he reached the first town to stop at. He also is on a bike, So that doesn’t leave him much room to carry water along. Lastly, the trip is tedious. He has been going for forty miles, and the speed limit is 55. He hasn’t acceded 12 mph. All to gether, the cyclists trip seems to be adventure that takes a lot of heart.
1	the setting affects the cyclist very strongly in the story because mentally and physically he wasn’t ready for where he was going. For example the text states “No a better, piece of advice for the solo cyclist would be never. Accept traver advice from a collection of old timers who wasn’t left the cosines of theer poiches since calter was in office.” So a youg guy took maid advice from older guys about how to get to a pack backin thier day it probably was a shortcut.   
2	The setting affected the cyclist because it was very hot and he didn’t have any more water also, there aren’t any towns that had good water in them, until he eventually arrived at this fishing comp. Due to his lack of water, he became dehydrated and really weak. “With what I believed was my last burst of energy, I maneuvered down the hill,” this quote shows that he was beginning to become dehydrated and losing his energy.
3	Different settings can effect how well your bycycle ride goes. If it is hot and you have lots of hills it makes it hard. If you have no hills and it is a sunny breezy day it makes it nice to ride. In the essay the biker had no water left but was going down a hill. The going down the hill part was probably easy but the fact that he had no water left was not a good thing.
2	The setting from the story left the cyclist in a mental way because most of the time the sun was on his mind due to the fact that he was pedaling hard in a hot summer day in June. The cyclist had very little water and with him biking under a beating sun wasn’t exactly helping him. He  had to like disasterous events like, peddling slopes than the normal speed, a snake blocking the path, old men telling to take a different route then be infected, and the fact that his water supply was low made him think he was going to pass out under the burning sun. However his determination was strong as he continued on pedaling through and he eventually found himself in another town but this time with people, fish and water.
1	From the setting that affected the cyclist are possible conditions such as the weather and surrounding enviorment like hills and streams or even tyes of animals and if they are poisenous or not. The setting has and can change the desision a cyclist makes.
1	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. One way is that the hot sun makes the cyclist dehydrated and since there is no water sources around the cyclist is not getting any water. The rough terrain makes the cyclist tired.
8	@ORGANIZATION1, I am writing this letter to inform you about the Use of computers. Computers can be fun and interesting, But, people are spending to much time on the computer. @CAPS3 opinion is you should spend time interacting with people in your society, your family, and friends. I also think that @CAPS2 is easy to get addicted to the computer, I should @CAPS1 I was a person that spent @CAPS3 time @NUM1 on the computer and @CAPS2 wasn't good. You should be safe on the computer because now and days @CAPS2's dangerous @CAPS2 is appalling that people spend More time on the computer than with ther own Family. Don't you agree? Well you shoud, your society, family, and friend should be the most important thing to you. You shouldn't be spending your whole day on the computer, you should be interacting with the people around you. Now and days you will see plenty of people on the computer and not spending time with there family. That shouldn't be going on. Although the computer is fun and interesting you will have people around you the wisher to spend time with you. You should think about this because this is happening to much in the world. @PERCENT1 of the people in @CAPS3 school say their addicted to the computer, and @PERCENT2 of the people in @CAPS3 community say their addicted to the computer too. Those are very high numbers don't you think? This is terrible and should stop going on. The computer is like a drug, you can get on the computer one time, then your just going to want to stay on ti everyday all day. The first time you get on the computer you will be addicted to @CAPS2 right away. I'm not saying you should never get on the computer, but be sure you won't get too addicted to @CAPS2 because @CAPS2 can happen very easily. @CAPS3 mother always sayed be safe on the computer&quot;. At first I didn't really @CAPS1 what she meant, but now I @CAPS1. What ever you do on the computer will stay their and be saved no matter how you try to delete @CAPS2. So, you should be safe and don't put any thing on the computer if you would want anyone else to see @CAPS2. Anyone can see what you put so you should be safe. Kids are meeting people they don't @CAPS1 and try to meet them. So you should watch out because the computer is the only place @CAPS7 you can lie. Now you should understand @CAPS7 im coming from. You should now agree with me and under stand that people should spend more time you don't get addicted and be safe.&quot;
3	Many features of the carlifonian desert influenced the cyclist during his ride.Ghost towns, rolling hills, and dangerous snakes influenced the cyclists experience during the''shortcut'' to yosenite.The Ghost towns along the journey syndized the world desrting him during his ride by offering no help with water supply as a place to cool dowdn.The road sign warning of rough terrain was another barrier on his bike ride that he had to get through in dehydration to reach his goal,yosenite.The diamondback rattlesnate caused additional horror to the cyclist's'' ride from hell''.He had to manuever around the serpent while unstable from dehydration.All features of the cyclist's riding setting affected his ride to yosenite.
1	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because if it’s raining or snowing it affects the cyclist because pavement can be wet and icy. Which causes the cyclist to slip and @DATE1 and the cyclist can really get injured. Also the cyclist has to wear a helmet if it’s very hot outside you wouldn’t see the cyclist in winter clothes. This would make the cyclist unfocus and the cyclist wouldn’t be able to finish any race.
2	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because he can’t go any farther because of the hills, and the snake. When he finds the bait shop he’s relieved. He relieved because he can get something to drink. He can also buy the worms to eat. The cyclist didn’t really know where he was going because there wasn’t a car, building, or structure in sight. So the cyclist just keeps on riding until he comes across the bait shop or the first “town” as he calls it in the essay. When he comes across the road that has 55 mph per limit, and he’s only 12 he knows that he’s not going anywhere near Yosemite National Park.
2	The features of the setting in “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” affects the cyclist in many ways. First the setting does not look like what the cyclist has been told it lacks like. The cyclist had stopped to get directions from a group of older men who’s directions were out of date. Second the conditions of the road affects the cyclist. In the essay the cyclist explains that, ”Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.” A final feature of the setting that affected the cyclist was the temperature. The hot sun beamed down on the cyclist. As you can see, the features of the setting in &quot;Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit&quot; affects the cyclist in many ways. 
3	The different settings in the essay/ writing affect the cyclist because of how old and hopeless they look. I think this because when the cyclist stops at the first town, he’s looking around expecting to find a quaint, bustling little place, but instead he finds these abandoned, decimated old houses. And if you yourself can picture being in his situation, then you can imagine how discouraging and almost frightening that must be. As the cyclist continues for a few more miles, he’s becoming slowly dehydrated, and finally sees a building. At first, he thinks this building is a mirage; he was wrong, but for him in this situation it was worse- an old juice factory, right when point you kind of get the feeling that every things turning against you and that there’s no hope left. But when he finds the fishing camp, his entire perspective of things changes, and he just feels so thankful to have been saved.
1	The setting affected the cyclist by the people from Lodi get him into the wrong way and he had to survive from there so he that was very dry and No water or nothing to the next stop was at the bait store so he was determined to get to next stop destination by he did want to give up own but the guy ask him did he want direction he said he was not going to be fooled twice.
3	It can’t be known as, &quot;easy&quot; to ride through a desert on a bike. Adding rough pavement, rusty water pumps, and not so friendly animals adds to the discomfort as well. The cyclist in this story encountered all these things, making his supposedly pleasurable ride turn to a semi brutal experience “it got down on my hands and knee, working the handle of the rusted water pump with all my strength. Alike substance ooed out, followed by brackish water feeling somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees, “This quote shows how the conditions of his water supply where, which eventually lead him to dehydration. It lead: ROUGH ROAD AHEAD: DO NOT @CAPS1 SPEED LIMIT.”This quote also shows how the riding conditions were making the  cyclist have a harder time keeping speed. “at some point tumberweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake-it really did look like a diamond back-beaked the majority of the pavement in front of me.” @CAPS2, this quote show of some of the dangers the  cyclist encountered. If  these features did not appear, then maybe the story would be describing a nice bike ride, but once you read about them, it becomes more of a disaster.
2	The features of the setting affected the cyclist greatly. It was so hot where he was that he kept drinking his water without realizing it until he only had a couple of sips left. The terrain also made him thirsty because the more he had to go up and down hills, the more he would drink. The fact that he did not see any town except on ghost town for miles affected him because he did not think he was going to make it to the next town. The setting played a major role on the cyclist because it affected him that much.
2	Setting plays a big role in this story. Without being in the desert in the hot @DATE1 there would not be a confict. There would be no importance in saving the water so he would not dehiderate. And the long flat roads are a symbol that the journey has still got a far way to go but as straight roads turn into hills it shows that there is a change in the journey and something better is about to happen.
3	The setting affect is used to a great extent in the short story “Do Not @CAPS1 Posted Speed Limit” The cycleist had beed going for a very long time when he came to the first town and there was no water At this point you can tell that he has lost confidence the “old timers&quot; directions. From this quote; “a ton-like substance oozed out.” This quote shows how after @NUM1 miles of pedaling when he was supposed to have come to two towns by that point his one chance of water had been depleated. The next time the setting affect is used is when he comes for a building that was rusted out. He said, “I hung my head” this shows how he almost completely lost all hope and that he was sure that he is going to die.
8	Do you think computers effect people's society? Computers help people of age first, computers let you chat with friends and family. Also, computers let you learn a lot about history. Finally, computer is a great way to keep busy. First computer is a great way to chat with friend that you havent spoke to in a long time. Also, it helps you meet new friends and to keep in touch with them in the long run. Finally the computer technologies is outstanding cause it allows you to chat with family memebers across state through video chat or even websites such as myspace, facebook and twitter. Secondly, @ORGANIZATION1 is a great way to learn about history. You can find history on almost everything from the past to the present. You can learn history about famous people places and events. That why I think the computer technologie is so outstanding what you think will happen if we didnt have today? Finally, computer is a great way to keep busy because you take the time looking up information for school projects. Also, you can spent your spare time playing games that help you learn or even book flight ticket for vacation. Finally, the technologie is here for a reason so we should use it for anything like getting up with friends or jus going on to look up information on anything you need to find out. In conclusion, I just told you why computer technologie is good to have. First, it lets you friends and family. Also, computers let you learn a lot about history. Finally, computer is a great way to keep busy. Now I just told you why @ORGANIZATION1 technologie is a good thing to have. I hope agree with my point of view.
8	Some people believe that computers are a positive effect to people, but its positive because it rots you brain. I think that computer is a waste of time and is an excuse for you to not spend time with you family as to go outside and enjoy nature. This is why computer time should be reduced and family time increased. Absolutley, computers is the type of things that can kill brain cells if you spend to much time on it. Teenagers are the main cause of this and when they get on the computer and get on myspace and facebook they wont be learning anything and just kill major brain cells. When they go to school to take the cmts they are going to fail because they wont know anything because of the computer. Also, This is a big problem for familys because they dont hang out with each other because their always on the computer. The excuse for parents is &quot;@CAPS1 im on the computer&quot; then they never go and the children get very upset. This leads to anger problems then they stop listening to you. All it is, is cause and effect. My friends on @NUM1 has anger problems and doesn't listen to anyone all because her family never hung. Consequently, peope spend most of their time inside on the computer, you guessed right! my sister is on the computer @NUM2 and she never goes outside to enjoy the nature. People can get that @LOCATION1 were they haute to go outside and we dont want that do eve. Doctor @CAPS2 brown says everyone should go outside to just relax mostly everyday because staying in the house is not good. The computer is defeating that purpose. On the other hand, the computer is a nifty device and can be very handy at times like if your need perfect directions or need a question answered. Sometimes you just want to talk to old time friends you haven't seen in a while. Computers are good for alot of things but to much of it is not good for us lastly, i'd like to say the computer has great purpose but i think it just makes excuses for us so we dont spend time with our family, dont go outside enough to enjoy the nature.
2	The cyclist is affected by @NUM1 couple different things. First, he is given directions that are out of date and then he has to deal with the heat of the weather in the early summer of California. If that wasn’t enough, he then runs out of water, which he needs very badly. He runs into a couple more problems, like seeing a big snake and coming to a factory that used to make juice and it was now run down and empty. After all of these obsticles, the cyclist pulls through and makes it to @NUM1 fishing store, where he gets water.
3	During the cyclist’s biking adventure he encounters several interesting situations. Each experience is in response to the setting in which it takes place. For example, this young man starts out confident with a bright hope of eventually reaching Yosemite National Park. The first spot he comes to is a ghost town This sight doesn’t immediately affect him, however it greatly adds on to the long term effects. He decides to continue on his treck reaching the next ghost from at this time he is becoming dehedrated due to his lack of water supply He decides to keep persueing his good and figures there must be water up ahead in the next town. In order to get the next town he must encounter some precarious situations including some changes in terrain. Eventually after reaching a source of running water he is overjoyed with happiness and relief. As evident in the provided text this man was effected by each feature of the setting. The different settings greatly affected his nature of confidence.
1	The setting effects the rider because if it’s hot you get thirsty and you have no water.This kind of question is hard to answer
1	The features of the setting affected the cyclist by making the journey more dangerous and difficult. For example, in the reading it states that rediculously large, poisonous diamond back snakes. Blocked majority of the pavement. So, the cyclist had to keep his/her balance to ease past them. The terrian also changed into short, rolling hills, making it even more difficult. 
2	The features in the setting of the essay affect the author in one major way, dehydration. There are several features that causes the author to dehydrate. First off, he is riding throught a desert located in california. This means that there is bent from the sun constintly beating down on him. Also the change from “Flat read”, (Kurmaskie) to “short, rolling hills” (@CAPS1) also affected him, getting dehydrated. This change cased him to use more energy to climb up the hills which means he used more water because he got thrister faster. This is how the features in the setting affected the author of the essay “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit.”
3	The features of the setting in “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” affect the cyclist. For example, the tough terrain made it very difficult for the cyclist to reach his destination, Yosemite. He was already very fatigued but had to overcome hills. In the essay, he states, “I noticed the terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills. The setting features also affected the cyclist when he encountered the snake. He was dehydrated and could barely navigate around the dangerous snake. The cyclist explains, “At some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path and a riduculously large snake, it really did look like a diamondback-blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me. I eased fast, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state. The setting also affected the cyclist because there was no one around him to help. The cyclist describes, “There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind.” The cyclist was all alone and had to rely on himself to make it to Yosemite. In conclusion, the features of the setting in “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” affect the cyclist. He had to overcome ruggid terrain without energy, avoid a diamondback snake, and make it all the way to Yosemite because there was no one around. As you can see, the features of the setting affect the cyclist.
2	The features of the land around the cyclist caused him to confront  nature. when he began his trip with advice from “old coggers” he “ rode out with strong legs and a smile.” As he came to the first town, he describes it as a “ghost town” having no water and no human contact for some time. This should have been his cue to stop and turn around in hopes of another route to Yosemite. But with strong determination, he rods on. Through the miles he incountered a ramshackie shed, rusty pumps, snakes,and the wicked terrain. The short rolling hills tested his “inner spirit” and caused his dehydration to further. The land around the cyclist not only victimized his heath but also caused a poor way to spend a vacation.
3	The harsh features at the setting affect the cyclist by hindering his journey to Yosemite National Park. As the cyclist is traveling along “The high deserts of California in June”, some problems arise. The heat from the pounding sun in the desert takes a toll on the cyclist causing him to drink more water and rapidly deplet his supply. The cyclist is also traveling through small “gost towns” rather than stoping at appropriate rest stops in order to refill with water and relax etc. Also while refilling he encounters hazards such as “Short rolling hills” through ghost the terrain and ever a snake. All of these features in the setting impare the cyclists ability to maintain confidence in wether he will make it to his destination and his positive attitude toward the journey etc.
1	Cycling is a very good sport people who do cycling are in shape. Also they have strong calve muscles. I think its also dangerous as well.
2	In the story the author says, “The sun was beginning to beat down trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state,” This gives you the idea that the heat is getting to him and is steadily depleting his water supply. At ore point he almost gives him self up to despair and dies of dehydration. It seems that he will never reach his good and he will continue to suffer in the grueling heat. I could almost feel the sweat and heat that the cyclist was feeling. Also, I could almost feel the lump in my throat when he says, “with any luck I’d hit a bump and lodge a pebble in my throat.” The heat definitely effects this mans cycling in a bad way. He was exhausted and could not go on without water.
8	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 I felt shoeked to see that there are people that beileve that computers don't benefit society and after hearing that I felt compelled to share my opinions. They help socitey. They help us communicate, do important thing have fun. Computers help us communicate in many ways. We all want to talk to our freinds, but we can not be with our freidns all the time, so there is she internet to help us. We also all have freinds we don't see very often, but we still want to talk to them so with is intenet we can talk to them as long as we went. Computers also help us make new freinds. They can also ehlpo us have fun. Computers are fun for many different reasons. Social networking sites, like facebook or myspace, are fun to be on. There are many fun things to do or the internet including video games, many video games consoles are attatched to the intenet so you can play with your freinds. But computers arent just all fun and games. Computers can transfer very important information including homework after schol activities. Computers also hold all of our governments information, from thingsas insignificant as plans for renovation on a town owned building to the department homeland security to the united states of without computers none of that would be possible. This should have conclude you that computers nessesary in our every day from communication, to very things computers have helped us and will to help us in the future.
2	The cyclist thought it was hard. Also he was upset that the old timers gave bad directions.
2	The setting affects the cyclist in many ways. First, he couldn’t get water from anywhere because he was in a dessert with nothing but ramshackle sheds and rusty camps. Second, there were short rolling hills, and rough roads which made it hard to ride on. There were tumbleweeds in his way and large poisons snakes. The heat made it hard to keep riding. And there were no buildings structures of people around to give him a lift or water. That is how the setting affects the cyclist.
3	In this essay by Joe Kurmaskie, a young man is baited into accepting outdated information by a group of old men. He pays for it later when on his bicycle, he is almost killed by heatstroke or dehydration. The setting is an excellent way to portray his feelings of hopelessness, despair, and fatigue. While he is just starting out, the road is flat and easy. It is cool and breezy. When he begins to run out of water, the terrain becomes bumpier and harder. He sees empty plains, cracked, dry ground, and the hot sun. He begins to despair even more. After a while when he thinks he can go no more he sees a store that once held gallons of grape juice. He laughs at the irony. The setting does do a wonderful job of describing his sense of helplessness.
2	In this pasage the cyclist was affected by the setting because if it had been any were else he would not have suffered or learned at all. Because the seting had botha lack of civillesation and water that he needed that caused him to almost faint of thirst. This is an example of the setting affecting the cyclist, “With what I believed was my last burst of energy, I maneuvered down the hill.” This showes that had all the setting been paridice he would never learned anything.
2	The features of the setting in the essay caused the cyclist to suffer and continue being determined. The author of the essay used phrases such as ‘the sun was beating down” and “high deserts of California in June” to emphasize the extreme heat that caused the cyclist extreme thirst and heat exhaustion. The essay also says “short rolling hills”, “tumbleweeds” and “long, crippling hill” to describe the difficult terrain the cyclist faced that caused him to be tired and slower.  Finally, the cyclist is faced with a “rediculously large snake” and plants and weeds which get in his way and force him to slow down.
2	The setting effects the cyclist very much. By the very dry climates
3	The setting in the story &quot;Rough road ahead” plays a great role on the characters journey. Some features that are mentioned in the story are heat, rough road, long crippling hills and a abandoned Grape Juice Factory. The heat in the story drives the cyclist into a dying thirst. @CAPS1 does her best to conserve her water through out the trip but the dry dessert heat doesn’t allow it. Then comes the rough road ahead. The cyclist trys to keep a steady and secure pass as @CAPS1 peddels along the bumps and breaks in the road. The long crippling hills are next in line the cyclist has to use all her energy to work up the hill. @CAPS1 wipes the sweat from her eyes to make sure its not a mirage and then @CAPS1 see’s it the abandoned factory. This is where the cyclist loses all hope for if @CAPS1 doesn’t receive water soon @CAPS1 is sure to be eaten by the birds. “Then, and easily as rounding a band, my troubles, thirst, and fear were all behind me. Gary and Wilber Fish Camp.” @CAPS1 rushed to the bathroom to drink the refreshing water to the sink pride and accomplishment overwhelm her.
2	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because it gives him the feeling of hopelessness. When the cyclist got directions to Yosemite from these two ??? old people, he thought he was getting a good shortcut. In reality, he was just led on a road that seemed to head nowhere where he saw many things that added to his feeling of hopelessness, for example, the author writes, “ I toiled on. At some points, tumbleweeds crossed my path and an adversely large snake. It really did move like a diamondback blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me.&quot; This shows that the cyclist is getting tired and seeing tumbleweeds, which usually represents a phase being completely deserted and deadly snakes that get in his way. This answers the question because it shows how the setting leads to his feeling of hopelessness.
1	The story “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” was a rough undergoing story about a cyclist going though rough climate and terrain. In this story the description was like a scorching path of nothingness for about as far for human eyes could see. In paragraph @NUM1 the text says “Wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that I could die from heatstroke.” is empressed how the climate felt. This explains the heat and how he felt during this experience. This whole trip sounds suffering.
1	The features of a setting can affect the cyclist in many ways. For example, while he was riding in the hot sun he became very thirsty because whe only had a few drops of water left. That is how the setting can affect the cyclist.
9	Dear whomever it @MONTH1 concern, @CAPS1 name is @CAPS2 @CAPS3 and I think that the effects that computers have on people is not good. I think this for a few different reasons. Those reasons are that because of them noboby goes out, people; especially students loose penmanship skills, and people loose their desire to do normal everyday things. They make us lazy!! Because of computers people don't go out. They don't go for walks because their doing something on the computer. There is now no reason for anybody to ever visit a store of any kind because you can order everything online and have it delivered right to your front door. Also, for a lot of people, they don't even have to go to work. They can work for whatever company right from their home computer. People can even finish highschool and college on their computers, by taking online courses! That brings me to @CAPS1 next reason for computers haveing a bad effect on people. Students, can now type out all assignments, some schools even give laptops to students to use throughout the year. Being able to type out everything would mean that students would barely ever have to pick up a pen or pencil, makeing their handwriting worse from lack of practice. Another way computers have a bad effect on students is because of the internet. You can find any and everything on the internet, from math books to dictionarys and other resource books. Because of this some students don't even know how to look up a word in the dictionary, let alone find needed information in a book. I think this gives students a wrong idea and sence of reality. When they go to work, not everything will be done on a computer, but this is all they are being taught to use. Lastly, people are losing their desire to do everyday things. Why go out with friends when you can talk to them online? Why go out to dinner when you can order it online? People are starting to see no point in going out and doing things because there are &quot;more important things&quot; to do on the computer. I personally think they are brain-washing us and pretty soon the world is going to be one giant computer. Based on everything I just said I don't think computers have a very good effect on effect on people. They are makeing the world a very uptight and controlled place to be and based on that selected information, I'm sure you can see why.
1	The features of the setting affect the cyclist greatly. They make it hard to concentrate, because its heat, they make it unbearable. The setting has the affect of drowsiness and thirst, “Dry bitter lnad, longing, longing.
2	In many ways, the setting affected his journey to Yosemite. If the setting wouldn't have been so bad, the long ride wouldnt have been as hard on his body. Since the setting was a very hot day in June, in a California desert, when he did find a well he said, “ followed by brackish water feeling somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees. ” @CAPS1 thing about the setting is, if it wouldnt have been so hot, he wouldnt have needed as much water. And, if he would have gotten the water he needed because it was so hot, it wouldn't have been so physically draining on his body. I know it was physically draining because he said “  I  could drop from a heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June. ” In conclusion, the setting played a major role in the story.
1	In the story “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” The man was riding a bike through rough lands. His adventure wouldn’t of been an adventure if he was just riding his bike an flat smooth element. The fact that the hills were steep, rocky and many hills is what made his bike ride what it was.
1	The features of the setting affect the cyclist is the old timers advice of how to get some were. Than the town they told go to was a ghost town. After he keep going the place that they told him to get water was very old and rusty and he pumped it he gaid tar came out. Than as he made his way in the dessert there way a snake came in the road he go around it. So never take advice from old timers.   
1	In the story, “Do not exceed posted speed limit,” the features of the setting affect the cyclist by showing the rough conditions he went through, and somehow perservered through. The author states numerous times the lack of water, and the rolling hills. Followed by brackish water feeling somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees.” This shows the struggle he went through and supports the setting story and how it affected his trip. This also shows how he perserverd through his struggles and made an effort to finish.
1	The riders condition was rough, from flat land to rolling hills. This would be hard for some one who is dehydrating. There was a snake in his path so he went around it. This would be dangerous he could blackout from lack of water and then get bit by the snake.
3	The cyclist depicted in the essay is greatly effected by his surroundings. First, he described a beating sun and pines and rushing rivers. All these items are very animated things. The river is even described as rushing instead of, maybe violent. The setting is active just like the cyclist. Next, a ramshackle shed is acknowledged, as well as rusty pumps and a bad souding corral. When these old, forsaken things one mentioned, it can be noticed that the cyclist starts being a little in despair. And to tap that off, he drinks water that tastes like “battery acid.” Battery eats at skin just like the setting is eating at the cyclist.
3	In the essay “Rough Road Ahead” the setting is able to affect the cyclists emotions and moods in both positive and negative ways. As the author travels through the desert he is already upset because it is so hot and water is scarce showing how the terrain is a negative influence. Another example would be when the author first sees the old water pump and he is relieved showing positive influence but the pump oozes a shine like substance he referrs to as tasting like “battery acid” changing his mood for the worst. Finally, the pebbles he puts in his math show is desperation and willingness to try anything to survive show a new posotive outlook on the desert until a pump “lodges are in his thro at” making yet another negative influence. All of these feature lead him on his way to “Gary and will fish camp” and grounded an extra boost on his journey through the desert.
2	The features of the setting affect him because it is hot and their is no where to go. An example from the test is when they said &quot;There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind.&quot; There was also a part where he got to a sign that said ROUGH ROAD AHEAD: DO NOT EXCEED POSTED SPEED LIMIT.The speed limit was 55 mph. He was doing a water a water - depleting 12 mph. Sometimes life can feel so cruel. Thats what affected the cyclist the heart the hilly roads, no water, snakes, rough roads, and most all no directions.
1	The features of the setting affected the cyclist because where they were.It was like in te middle of nowhere and every person they asked are having all times.They go the wrong directions to the nearest town.The old guy told him it was @NUM1 miles down the road when he went @NUM2 miles to the next town and said to him self he will never take directions from a gut that has all timers and hasn’t left the confines of their porches since carter was in office.
6	Dear local newspaper, @CAPS1 my opinion on this is that people do use computer's a lot! Some people don’t care about exercising, or enjoying nature, maybe people dont even have friends so they spent a lot of there time on the computer because they have no life or maybe they just go on websites that are addictive. For example @CAPS2.com, people/kids have one of those? They chat with friends or maybe even boyfriends. Enyways thats my opinion. Another opinion is that I think people should not spend most of there time on the computer. I think that because people should be having fun, socializing with people, and living there life! So this is what I I think, my opinion about &quot;Computers&quot;.
2	When the cyclist is in the “serenity of an early sunset evening”, the man enjoyed his cycling just hoping he could cut his time in half. Then, once he got the advice and headed down the road he saw a ghost town which is never good. Next he came to the fork and the town he came to had no water. On the way to the new town he came to the bumpy road and going @NUM1 he was out of water but finally after his determination he made it to a place that was very nice. So as you can tell the features of the scenery road affected him greatly.
1	I think that the setting made him find more courage inside him self to save his water and go to the next town with out any water.
2	The environment affected the cyclist violently in the story “do not exceed posted speed limit” It seems that all of the harsh conditions of cycling in California all worn down this kid who took some faulty directions from older people at one stop. The heat and lack of water supply made the boy dehydrated. It says in the essay “The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips. Wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that I could drop from heat stroke on a georgus day in June simply because I listend to some gentlemen.” this explains on how simply exhausted he had become due to the miles of cycling, and the beating down sun and total lack of water due to absence of all towns. He came to the point of almost dying from heat exhausgen because of the faulty directions of the old people. Next time, he better make sure to keep extra water and stick to the map for directions.
3	As the cyclist makes his journey towards Yosemite, the setting causes him much worry and concern. In the beginning, the narrator is content and excited. He is doing something that be lovers, is heading for a beautiful destination, and has found a short cut to save him hours of time. He is confidentin the directions given to him by the old men. However, as he continues down the winding road, his environment makes him doubt theirjudgement. The first town he comes to is entirely deserted.Though at first he laughs it off, he laster realizes just how much trouble he in if he didn't come to a civilization soon. The cyclist runs across &quot;ramshackle shed[s]&quot; and shut down factories, and as his water supply sinks lower, the road seems to tantalize him. He passes a water pump (just what he needs), yet the water is something close to toxic. A road sign reminds him not go too fast, though he @MONTH1 die if he doesn't pick up the pace. He is forced to look at a picture ofa happy boy guzzling grape juice as he dehydrates. All there features of the setting, in addition to the overpowering heat and sun, drive the narrator to the breaking point.      
0	The feature of setting affects the cyclist because every thing that was happing years ago are happen now in todays world meaning wars. Rights &amp; etc todays feature is the same. Every thing is repeating it’s self.
3	When riding a bike it @MONTH1 not seem to hard. For a cyclist every thing becomes more serious. The determination to win and be the best even if it kills you. In this essay he under estimates the dder cyclist. When really they are the people with more knowledge. Some of the things that @MONTH1 be hard for cyclist are the rough roads. Not only having a chance to be killed of dehydration or being ran over. Riding bike is really hard work when having to ride in hundred degree weather. Drinking drink after drink never having any water. No water and it being so hot could cause a heat stroke. As road get worse chances get higher tumble weeds and snakes in the way, he was determined to win. After all was said and he faced the horror that nature brought him he knew he was wrong wrong for them and the intelligants.
2	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many different ways. The fact that he was in the California desert and the heat affected him because he had limited water and was using his energy riding the bike. The “towns” he came across also made an impact on him because of the fact that he couldn’t get more water or a place to rest. “I was doing a water depleating @NUM1 sometimes life can feel so cruel”. This shows how the hilly terrain and dehydration and heat are affecting the cyclist.
1	Two of the biggest setting in this story is the desert and rolling hills. This would effect the rider becaus of the dehydration that he would experience. Being in the desert would make it obviously hot so you sweat alot and the hills would make it tough on your body because you put extrat strain to get up them. So all together this would be a hard bike ride.
1	In the story, “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” by Joe Kurmaskie, the cyclist experiences dehydration on his journey. The cyclist takes directions from older guys who look like they haven’t left their porches in ages. He takes their advice and he then sukkers in the long run because he cannot find water and it is a hot @DATE1. He hikes uphills in the heating sun and fears a heat stroke. There was no sight, not a building, car.
1	The setting will either effect the cyclist in a good way or a bad way. In the story “Rough Road Ahead” by Joe Kurmaskie it affects the cyclist in a bad way and a good way. In the story, it continues to talk about lack of water. “When I tried a drop or two it had the flavor of battery @NUM1). This shows that the heat made the water warm, so it did not cool him down. But a good way it affect them is pebbles. &quot;I read once that sucking on stones helps take your mind off thirst by allowing what spit you have left to @NUM2). This shows that even though he has no water the pebbles can make him less thirsty. This is how the setting affects the cyclist. In good way and a bad way.
8	Dear @CAPS1 of @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS2 you think our excersizing and being in nature is becoming less and less? I don't think so in my opinion. I think computers is a positive effect because it can help you connect with other people from different parts of the world. Learn different stuff or how to's to make life easier. Be in-touch with far-away relatives. First of all, I believe computers is a positive effect because you can connect with people from different parts of the world. You can talk about thier culture. About how the, whats thier tradition of marriage or etc. The schools, and ask them questions. Secondly, I believe computers is a positive effect because you can learn stuff from it and how to's to make life easier. Because you can learn it easier with different under standing it better so you. Study from the to's to get school. Thirdly, I believe computer is a positive effects far away relative. If you talk to them in a long time wondering how there doing what they life. When we meet up catch. In conclusion, technology will basically help you in the future well. The marvolous computer will help you be in-touch with really good familys and friends. Now its time to @CAPS3! because the fancy technology will be here till years too come!
3	In this story it is clear how difficult the cyclists journey is. He has to conquer wrong directions, lack of water, rattle snakes and fear of dieng. However he shows great determination and control. An example of his determination is “The old guys had sworn the next town was only eighteen miles down the road. I could make that. “This shows his determination that he feels he can go on such a long journey. An example of his self-control is shown in paragraphs @NUM1 and @NUM2. When finding this building to be abandoned, and all things, juice, anyone use would have become frustrated and wanted to give up. But not this cyclist he controlled his anger and again showed determination. And it paid off in the end he found his water and survived. This story is a great story that shows determination and self control.
3	Early in the morning, the cyclist is eager and ready to face the adventurous path that had been mapped out by the older travelers. He hardly noticed the “sun was beginning to beat down.” He was calm and was looking forward to the “cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite.” Never once did he imagine what he had gotten himself into. As he began to approach the desert, he noticed he was running low on water. The strenuous activity of biking combine d with the scorching heat of the desert began to take effect. The cyclist was so desperate for water that he had to put pebbles into his mouth. He had once read, “that sucking on stones helps take your mind off thirst by allowing what spit you have left to circulate.” The cyclist was hoping for a way out of the misery he had come across. Dehydration took it’s toll, and he felt hallucinations. He was beginning to lose hope. The heat and the hills and the lack of water had the greatest affect on the cyclist. Had he not been riding through a hilly desert one afternoon in June, he would have been fine.
2	In  the   cyclist   story  the  setting   took  a  huge  roll on  how  the  story    thined   out.The  water  had  a lot  of  effects  on  the  cyclist.The  setting  of the story  took  place  in  the  high  deserts of  california   in  june.As  soon  as  you  read   that  you  now  something  is  wrong.In   the  story  he say  ,the  sun  was  beginning    to  beat  down .This  is going  to  affect  him because  hes  riding  through the desert on  a  bike,which  causes  him  to  become  dehydrated .I  eased  past,trying  to  keep my  balance  in  my dehydrated  state.Thes begining   to  lose  his  mind  because  he  has  no water  because   of  the  setting.Everything  about  the setting  causes  the  cyclist  some  problems.The  heat ,the   setting ,the  lack  of  water  almost  causes him his  life.    
1	The setting affects the cyclist in alot of ways. The first way is that he was riding in the middle of a desert in June. If he was riding  in @LOCATION1, it woudn't be painfully hot. Also, the rolling hills probablly didnt help If it was mostly down hill, he would have been fine. Riding a bike up a hill when your tired is near impossible.
2	In the story “Do not exceed posted speed limit” by Joe Kurmaskie the features of the path to @ORGANIZATION2 greatlly affected the cyclist. One the way to the park the cyclist came across a big snake that covered the road which greatly frightened the biker. Also the roads were long and very bumpy and windy. The road weren’t the most comfortable to be riding on. In the story “Do not exceed posted speed limit” by Joe Kurmaskie the features of the path to Yosemite National Park greatlly affected the cyclist. One the way to the park the cyclist came across a big snake that covered the road which greatly frightened the biker. Also the roads were long and very bumpy and windy. The road weren’t the most comfortable to be riding on. There was nothing insight for the cyclist to see. The cyclist did not have much energy because he had no hope for him. The author states, “…  gaining elevation while loosing hope.” Last the weather was hot and dry which tired the cyclist out. He had no water with him and with the weather he had no energy or hope to help him through the journey to Yosemite National Park.
2	In the story “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed limit the cyclist expirenced a few life threating times during his adventure. The first feature was when was in a deseret with temptures of @NUM1 degrees and his lit bit of water tasted like battery acid. As he tried to keep going he lost hope and thought he was going to die. This affected him because as he lost hope he thought more negative about things and didn’t think he would make it but the he got the agility to move on. In this story the setting affects the characters dramatically.
1	The feature of the setting is making the cyclist frustrated, thirsty, and confused. The features are making him frustrated by he thought he was going the right way where he really was going out.
2	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because the features are what cause the climax of the story. An example of this would be the line, “I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly, and I was traveling through the high deserts of California.” This line shows that the author was in a very hot place, being in a desert, but also that he has a low water supply. These two conditions are what cause the climax, which is the possibility that he could collapse at minute from heat exaustion. This is why the features of the setting affect the cyclist.  
3	Certin features of the setting affected the cyclist. In the essay by Joe Kurmaskie, he desribes he’s experiences when he cycled through the desert. ''...arrived at the first town''...it fit the traditional difinition of a ghost town. ''at first the cyclist was amused at this town and maybe a little scketle at it because the old “codgers”  told it to be thriving. Halfway through his journey the stated ''sometimes life can be so cruel.” Water was running low and he still had a ways to go untill he made it to the park and he felt as If it would never end. All that he sees aroun him as hills of nothingness under the sorching son with his limited amount of water. No buildings are around the cyclist. The ghost town and the lack of shade or soluation are very features of the setting that make that cyclist feel like a fool for taking advice from older men.        
2	I am going to explain how the setting of the cyclist affected him. The setting of the cyclist affected him by making him very hot &amp; drinking his water &amp; he would soon run out of water &amp; dehydrate. For example in the story the cyclist would always bring up the little bit of water he had left &amp; around the essay he talked about the dehydration he was seeing &amp; even death. Another example is the relif he had when he drink the water from the sink. In conclusion, this is how the setting affected the cyclist.
8	Would you ever think that a computer can take to much time or keep you from doing lots of things. Does using a computer mess up your life in some ways I would say no. The computer is common life everybody needs it or uses it in some way of form. People need it because they look a news when they could not catch it on @CAPS1 so they go to the amazing technoliga. We have witch is the @CAPS2.C of laptops or phone with internet. This just is a natural thing in are lifestyle now the computer does not stop you from going outside and playing other things its you say no I love this tecnoligy do much that I want to stay on it. So does the computer mess up someones life in anyway or is it just you. The beautiful things a @CAPS2.C can do for you. A computer can do lots of things for you wont want to leave it and go do other things, like you have lots of home work and a project that you need I @CAPS4 for so you go do your work and you can also listen to music and type your project and doing things even though your not outside playing and being active doesn't mean that your not doing somethings better for your life like typing faster for a job when you get older and nowing how to use a @CAPS2.C good and not being out of touch with family there is cameal. @CAPS2.C's have been around for a long time and eversince this world has had them we have been smarter more talented in most ways and kids and adults are in touch with wats going around us and how the world is acting technology has helped many people when they needed something done in a rush or for mostly everything they have been around for things the @NUM1 year old people can still go. Research things that they have never known. And find out billions of aplications for it. Although most people stay on for long periods of time but they cant stay on all day without say hi to family and talking to them. So has been around for a long time and still is being used everyday and always will be. So would you think that a computer is tacking to much time in a persons day and they are not spending enogh time with family or is it just that compturs are a all natural thing that everybody needs.
1	This paragraph tells about how careful you should be on the roads.This also talks about what you have to be aware of.There so many things that could happen.You have to take control when your on the road.
3	The features of the setting in “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” by Joe Kurmaskie affects the cyclist in many ways. For example it states “This place might have been a thriving little spot before the last world war it fit the tradition definition of a ghost town.” This statement is talking about town he arrived at when he was trying to get to Yosemite. This would affect the cyclist because he was riding in confidence in the beginning but then the first town he arrives in looks like a ghost town, which would bring his confidence a little bit lower than before. Just like when people travel when they know where they are going they feel good, but once they come to a place they know then they wont feel so confident. Another example is when he has to ride on rolling hills, and then comes across a “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” sign. This would affect the cyclist because then he would be frustrated and stressed out because he rode all that way and not he cant go any further, and that is not the place he wanted to be at. Therefore the features of the setting in “Do not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” by Joe Kurmaskie affects the cyclist.
2	The conditions that the bicyclist faced that affected his trip were various amount of things that could really screw your ride up. Some of the conditions were hot It was very hot and that makes it hard to think fast, move fast and make good decisions another would be there was lose gravel and that makes it tough to maneuver and you have to watch your speed. So he’s not going anywhere in a hurry. also there were lets of hills and that makes for an uncomfortable ride and a tiring one atthat. Adding to that he was fresh out of water and that can mean dehydration again bud judjment and even heat stroke or exoustion another bad thing is he was in the middle of nowhere so its not like he could stop. Some where we asks for a drink to, there was nothing around for miles. These things show how rough the rode was made because these conditions exsisted.
1	The setting was very hot dry and was a desert. This setting effected him be it was making him very dehidarted and hot. It was very hard for him to go any fourther but he knew he had to keep going. Also the land was very barin and ething around. Clearlier the setting effected the biker.
1	The setting affected the cyclist because they were in California in June traveling back rodes, with no place to stop for water, if the cyclist would have followed the path they intended on following the ride probably have been more enjoyable and he/she wouldn’t of had to worry about a heatstroke or running out of water, they would have been fine.
3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist greatly. There were hills and rocks, snakes and no buildings or people. The hills and rocks would make it much harder to to stay strong and be able to keep riding. The abandoned building and there being no people, could affect him emotionally. It would make him loose hope and the determination to keep going to find destination. He did not think he would get that after seeing a deserted town. After all, he did say, “It didn’t really matter. I was going to die … “(Kurmaskie).
1	The main features of the setting that affected the cyclist are the fact that it was June and the dessert heat. “… I could drop from heat stroke on a gorgeous day in June….” (kurmaskie @NUM1). This helps us realize how bad the heat is in June in the middle of California dessert. This affected the cyclist by his dehydration and the fact that he was inthe middle of no where with no one to help him. This is how the month of June and the dessert heat affected the cyclist.
2	The features of the setting greatly affected the cyclist in this story. First, when he got to the road sign that said “Rough Road Ahead” he was already low on water, but that made things much worse. The rough road made it harder for him to pedal; therefore, he was working harder and getting thirsty. Also, when he stopped at the old Welch’s Grape Juice Factory, he noticed some pebbles on the ground and shoved them in his mouth. “I’d read once that sucking on stones helps take your mind off thirst by allowing spit you have left to circulate”. Lastly, “GARY AND WILBER’S FISH CAMP”, could possibly have saved the cyclist’s life. He stopped there and finally got a well deserved drink of water to settle his dehydration and fear. The setting and features severly affected the cyclist throughout his journey.  
3	In “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit”, the features of he setting affect how the author feels. In the beginning of the essay, the author is confident and happy, and the setting is, “a reservoir camp ground outside at Lodi, California” (Kurmaskie @NUM1). This sounds like a good place to be refreshed and to feel confident. Later into the bike ride, the author is affected negatively by the barren area he comes to when he says, “This sight was troubling&quot; (Kurmaskie @NUM1). Finally when he reaches a modern store, he is relieved due to the modern facility when he states, “Then, as easily as rounding a bend, my troubles, thirst, and fear were all behind me” (Kurmaskie @NUM3). The area the author goes through has an effect
1	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because they don’t ride as much anymore and don’t know the best routes to take. So they just take their old routes, thinking they are still the better way, but when they use them they realize how tiring and bad they are.
8	Dear @CAPS1, I feel like computers are good for you in a lot of ways. Like computers sometimes keep kids out of the street so they wont get in trouble. The computer has a lot of games you ran play on so it would keep you doing something. Computers also have something called microsoft and microsoft is something that help you do writing projects and things like that. Computers help a lot of people cause like I said earlier it has games and some of those games have to do with school such as science, math, reading, and social studies so it is very helpful. Computers are also bad for people like you because when you go on it most teens liketo go on something called myspace. Myspace is a thin that you can have freinds all around the world and can talk to them and put pics of yourself on it. If you go on myspace and have friends from different state or the same state you that they world want to find you and rape you. They would start a conversation with you like they would ask you for your name and where you live. Another reason its bad is because when @NUM1 graders go to the middle school @NUM2 grader will tell the inaproperate websites and the little kids would go on it and will get in trouble. Well you heard my opoin I hope you understand thank.
3	“At some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path..” being out in the desert with limited or no water can make one feel like life is very cruel. The sun was beating down and no water or shade is seen when he reaches a point. The sign that said “Rough @CAPS1 ahead; Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit.” had to be intimidating. Considering he was on a bike he could only move so fast. Those old men probably were never off their front porch since carter was in office. yes like the writer said “the world is a fluid place.  Things  change.” The old men probably had close to no due what they were talking about considering things have changed since @NUM1 (when carter was in office). The snake that he came upon, must have been rather intimidating. Knowing there is a creature like that, there is bound to be more. In eseance I think the setting was a major part why the cyclist felt that way
1	From what there is in this  picture the cyclist is riding a dry and area which could mean that it is very hab and the cyclsit looks to be going down hill there looks to be a lot of turns. From the body position of the cyclist he seems to be trying at his best and hardest to make it to his destination. All of this could be a bag stress on the cyclist, he maybe sweating really hard and maybe tired the wind @MONTH1 not be helping him at all.
3	In the short story “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Speed Limit” by @PERSON1, a cyclist travels through an extreme climate and tough terrain that nearly end his life to get to his destination. After getting outdated directions from some elderly locals, the protagonist sets off on his journey to Yosemite National Park. Soon thereafter, the cyclist notices something is amiss. The first “town” the locals said he’d find is deserted. And now, twenty miles into his journey, the cyclist needs to refill some of his water supply. The water pump there has “the flavor of battery acid.” With the next town @NUM1 miles away, the cyclist struggles to conserve his water to make it there. Even then, things get worse. As he is, “traveling through the high deserts of California in June”, “flat road was replaced by short rolling hills.” @CAPS1 tell him not to exceed the speed limit of @NUM2 as he does a “water-depleting @NUM3.” eventually, even on his few sips of water, the cyclist finds a spot to fill up on water, knowing now to strike out on better days and better directions.
2	The features of the setting affected the cyclist. When she was riding it was very hot this caused the cyclist to lose energy and dehydrate. Also when the cyclist went through a terrain change. The road changed into rolling hills. This caused the cyclist to become tired because after riding up and down your body gets tired. Also being as the weather was so hot this caused the cyclist to drink a lot of water. Eventually she ran out and then got dehydrated. This whole situation implied to stick to your original plan. If the cyclist would have done that she wouldn’t have had to go through the hardships.
3	Each new feature of the setting in the essay entilled, “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” by Joe Kurmaskie, affects the cyclist in some way. For example, in the text , when the narrator stated that he had to avoid a “ ridiculously large snake “crossing the road, he became more aware of his surroundings and almost seemed to forget how thirsty he was until he finally abided the large reptile. Also in the text, when, “over one long, crippling hill, a building came into view,” hope was replenished into the cyclist. This hope allowed the narrator to because more tenacious about his journey in order to arrive at the old building. Eighther for better or worse, a few feature of the setting arrives and affects the cyclist every step of his journey.  
3	Many features of the setting of the cyclist’s excruciating trip affect him mentally and physically. When he first sets out, the pine trees and rivers kept him cheerfully riding through the landscape. When he sees the corral and the rusty pumps, he becomes discouraged and begins to notice his tiredness and thirst. When the cyclist encounters a rough terrain with tumble weeds and snakes, he is both mentally and physically exhausted. He begins to doubt his consciousness and worries that he @MONTH1 not complete the journey. The abandoned grape juice factory is also a let  down for the cyclist’s mental state. When all hope is seemingly lost, he finally comes across water, and his unique (but very important) lesson is learned.
1	The features of the setting had an affect on the cyclist. I know this because in the story the cyclist said that he was “going to drop from heat exsostion”, he is riding through the desert in @DATE1, and he took directions from three old “gentlemen” sitting on a porch.
2	The features of the setting affected the cyclist. First since he was in a desert, the heat of the desert greatly dehydrated him on his journey to the parts. Also, the bumpy roads and rolling hills slowed the bike down to 12 mph since it was to extreme for him to handle at high speeds. When he sees the fist building because he fist is relived but soon after he loses all his hope because it is desserted. Even the old men that living in the area have an affect on the cyclist because they give him out-dated directions that almost @CAPS1 him. Because of this, he will probably rest first an old man’s short tentS again. This is how the features of the setting affected the cyclist.
1	Well first off its very hot and dry witch can dry a person out easily. And the hills are hard to get up so it would be a challange to get to the top. All I know is the lack of water can kill you if you get heatstroaks easily.
1	In the essay “Rough Road Ahead: Do not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” by Joe Kurmaskie, the features of the setting affect the cyclist. At first the cyclist thought that the journey he was about to go on was going to be a good one, but that soon changes. For example, “Never accept travel advice from a collection of old-timers who haven’t left the confines of their porched since Carter was in office.” This quote tells how at first the cyclist thought his journey was going to be a good one, but getting information from two old men soon changed that. The features of the setting affect the cyclist in the essay “Rough Road ahead: Do not Exceed Posted Speed Limit.”  
8	Dear @LOCATION1 press, I believe that computers have a terrible impact on society, the reason I believe this is true is that kids can go &quot;braindead&quot; as some people call it. Also kids can get obese witch is already a greatly growing process. The last reason is that kids get bad eye sight from it. The first reason I believe that computers have a bad impact on our society is that all kids do is sit there and eat while they are on the computer and they get an addiction to it so they just keep getting fatter because they arn't getting any exercise. This problem with children getting fat is already a very brought up topic and with something like this out it's not going to get any better any time soon. Studies show that @PERCENT1 of kids who are on the computer more than a hour and a half a day are actually going braindead. This means that if this becomes the new trend for all kids that our next generation will not be smart and won't be able to keep up with other countries and fall behind, so we have to do something about this trend setting issue if you want our country to stay in one piece. The last but not least reason is kids are forming a bad eye sight. This can also bad for future generations. If you let this catch on the generation will all need glasses its almost like a domino effect. These are all the reasons that computers have a bad impact on the society. kids get obese, they go braindead, and they develop bad eye sight from it.
2	The features of setting affect the cyclist in that a desert-like temperature and the terrain on which he must bike make him more prone to thirst and exhausting. The heat @MONTH1 cause the cyclist to dehydrate faster than normal. This is especially true in this case because of his lack of water. The cyclist might pass out or suffer a heat stroke. The terrain of rolling hills will tire out the cyclist quicker than if he were still on the flat road. His muscle will start to ocha and his body will need water and rest. The story would totaly change if the setting were different. If the cyclist were biking in the @DATE1 on a cold day in the mid @NUM1 he would not have a chance of suffering a heatstroke. There would be a significantly less chance of him becoming dehydrated. The setting is very important in every story and can change everything.
2	In Joe Kurmaskie’s essay “Rough Road Ahead,” the speaker is biking through some rough terrain in blistering heat, not to mention long distances. He has to ride up and down small and large hills through what he believes is a shortcut to his destination. He has a limited water supply, and he keeps coming cross ghost towns, where the only water is boiling brackish water that is unfit for human consumption. Probably the worst setting feature for this guy as the Welch’s Grape Juice Factory (abandoned of course). Adding salt to the wound was “A sandblasted picture of a young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice into his mouth could still be seen” (kurmaskie @NUM1). To the narrator with his dwindling water supply, this billboard was especially daunting to him on his journey.
1	Desert, Hills and road condition and lack of water –all are how the setting affected the cyclist. First, the cyclist reveals he is in the desert when he exclaims, “I was trave ling throug the high deserts of california in June.” This means it was hot. Second the hills and road condition’s were horrible. The cyclist reveals this when he describes, “flat road was replaced by short rolling hills,” aid againg  It read: Rough road ahead: Do not exceed posted speed limit. Lastly, He had thought that he would have stops on the way to get water from. So he drank all the rate he wanted. He then figured out the needed to conserve it but by then it was too late. The examples shows that the cyclists condition was harder than he expected them to be.
1	The features of the setting affect the cyclist. The winding road could affect his turns because he could turn to far one way and fall off his bike and get hurt real bad. Another feature that could affect the cyclist is grass on both sides of the road. If he tireds to take a short-cut and goes into the grass he could he could hit a rock and flip off his bike and get hurt. That is what the feature of the setting could affect the cyclist.
1	The setting of where the cyclist was, was a californa desert in the middle of June. He thinks hes going to die towards the end because of the directions he got. “Never accept travel advice from a collection of old timers who haven’t left the confines of their porches sinse carter was in office.” This means to never take directions from people who haven’t been to the place for  a while.
2	The setting was a hot desert in California that a biker got stuck in going to Yosemite National Park. These settings were hard on the cyclist. For example, he listened to some old people who led him the wrong way and could have had him killed. He was running out of water and his legs felt like they were going to break off. All of these troubles did affect his trust in old locals though. He learn that just because they are old and looks wise they have information probably older than the artifacts at a museum. Besides he has a trust map: He got a lot from this trip.
1	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. For example, in “ghost towns”, there is no-one to ask directions from or to just talk to. Also, some pumped water from water pumps tastes like “battery acid” and could most likely make some one sick. Also, there are poisonous snakes and other dangerous animals.
1	There are many features in the story, &quot;that affect the roles, like out of waters, bad directions. The narrator is ??? and says, &quot;the water bottles container a few tantalizing sips..” it is say that there is hardly any water left , and he still have to keep going on, until he can find some In the story water is something he has to over come because he is out of it by the time he gets to the fish store.
1	In this @ORGANIZATION1 I will explain how the features of the setting affected the cyclist. In the short story “Rough Road A Head Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” The whole ordeal occurs in the “high deserts of california.” @CAPS1 to the text the cyclist had taken “out of date” direction from elderly people who thought they new the way. The cyclist encountered a snake, ghost town ad shutdown factory. Most of the time the cyclist was going over.
3	The setting in  “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” adds drama into the story by how it affects the cyclist. He was tacking through the “high desert of California in June”. June is a hot part of the year and since he was in the hottest desert part the hot was multiplied. The terrain changing into “short rolling hills” didn’t help the cyclist. The hills would make any riding more difficult. Anyone who ride a bicycle knows it takes more effort to go up a hill than on a flat pavement. With the person lack of water anyone would be struggling to keep riding on. Most people didn’t have that hints to keep moving. He didn’t set a very goal he just went to the “next Horizon”. Shouldn’t he just wanted to keep going. Another problem with the physical environment was the road conditions. When the “Rough Road Affect” sign appeared the travel then become more difficult. A bike tire take more effort to go over uneven pavement is why the cyclist had so much trouble.
8	Dear local newspaper, I think people are spending to much time on the compture an these are my reasons, Less time exercising, an enjoying nature and interacting with friends an family. My reason is less time exercising people are to busy on the computer playing games an talking to other ones. Dont you think you should be outside doing some exercising like running around or playing sports instead of being in your house on the comptuer doing nothing. People should at lest get @NUM1 of exercising. You could be on the comptuer for a little while but not on it @NUM2. Take a break from the comptuer an go outside for a little bit injoy the weather an being outside. People just cant take @NUM1 away from there comptuer time I find that really hard to belive that people cant. Its like the comptuer took over there brains an all they want to do is be on it an never get off. My second reason is enjoying the nature go outside for a little bit an see whats going on there go take a walk outside in the woods an look for the animals or look for animal tracks. There are a lot of fun things you can do outside like climb a tree or going fruit picking. You dont have to be inside all day an stare at the computer playing games an talking to friends. You could be outside injoying the nice weather you are getting. Peopl need to learn that there is better things to do with there time. My third reason is that interacting with friends an family. It inportant you spend time with them an see how they been an what they been up to. But instead people are always to busy to talk to there family members becuse they are always on the comptuer doing stuff they dont need to being doing. There are a lot more inportant things in life an people need to understand that. Family is way more inportant then being on the computer but people these days they put family second because they never want to talk to them or see them because they are always so busy waisting there time on the comptuer. Like checking there email is fine but waisting your time on these chat things like @CAPS1 or @CAPS2 or @CAPS3 its just a waist of your time people can hang out an do things they dont have to be on the computer asking there friends that they should just call them an ask. Dont get me wrong I have a @CAPS2 to an it takes away from your hanging with family an things but I make time for I can hang out with friends an family an enjoy the natuer an I do exercis. So I dont see why its so hard for people to do that. So in conclusion I think that people do waist there time on the comptuer to much like I said there are more inportants things in life an things you can be doing like exercising, Enjoying natuer an hanging with friends an family. So I hope you take my ideas an consider them an thank you for listening to what I think. I hope people can get it through there head that they dont have to be on the comptuer @NUM4.
3	In the story “Do not exceed posted speed limit” by Joe Kurmaskie the setting affected the cyclist in a hard way. With only a few sips of water left he said'' … abandoned years earlieR, by the looks of it it had been a @CAPS1 Grape Juice factory and bottling plant. A sand blasted picture of a young boy pouring a refreshing glass of Juice into his mouth could still be seen. I hung my head.'' When only having a few drops of water and seeing that would have increased my thirst more. Another way the setting affected the cyclist in a hard way was &quot; The speed limit was 55 mph. I was doing a water-depleting 12 mph. sometime ife can feel so cruel.'' This remind him that hes not in a car, and that hes not even going half the speed limit. The setting affects the cyclist by reminding him how long his journey is, and now at this point he is suffering.
2	In the essay, “Rough Road Ahead:Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” the setting the cyclsit is in effects him greatly. One evening when he was resting he got into a deep conversation with a couple of elders. Eventually they got to talking about his journey, and the two men gave him direction for a shortcut. “But on that morning it fit the traditional definition of a ghost town.” When he arrives at the first town, he finds it deserted, this effects the cyclist because has eventually going to need more water. As he continues, he comes to a slep in the road. “After I had arrested the first few of these a large highway sign jumped out at most read:ROUGH ROAD AHEAD:DO NOT EXCEED POSTED SPEED LIMIT” This sign was indicating that the road was going to be bumpy, which makes it even more challamging for the cyclsit. So, the setting is very important in this essay because it has a lot to do with how the cyclist feels. When the abandoned towns come into pray, no enging to feel hopeless. When the road get bumpy, he gets tired. When he gets to an actual running store, he’s relieved.
0	The feature of the setting affects the cyclist because the features is just a brief preview of what the text is going to be about or who is involved in it. The cyclist gives you what you want and need to know so the affect would be about time the feature is finish play in noone would want to see the cyclist.
2	In the story, &quot;Rough Road Ahead: Do not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,&quot; by Joe kurmaskie, the features of the setting affect the cyclist. The setting of a story is the background, place, and time the story took place. In the story, a cyclist needs to get to @CAPS1 Park. He stops and gets direction from a group of old men, who aren’t up with the times, and the cyclist gets lost. He faces drought, a snake, and being lost in the desert, the cyclist says, &quot;At some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake – it really did look like a diamond back – blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me. I eased past, to
1	The cyclist choose the worst time to ride his it was an “early summer evening” in California. At this time the sun is hot and with little water and also lost, it was hot the best choice that he made. A cyclist before do a trip he or she should be prepared for whether conditions and also check a map of the place before going anywhere. 
1	The cyclist run into a diamond headed snake, is out of water and is in the middle of nowhere the thing I would do is find some rope or cord time old building or tree and hang myself for taking directions from old people  that havent left their porches since carter was in office.
1	The features of this particular setting affected the cyclist in many different ways. Upon arriving at the “ghost town” early in his journey, he felt slight amusement at the situation. But he soon became very troubled when he became aware of the several rusty pumps and a weak corral, next to a ramshackle shed. The cyclist additionally experienced a bit of irony as he approached the 55 mph speed limit sign complete with a warning to strictly obey it. On his bicycle, at a pace of 12 mph, he could not even reach the 55 mph speed if he had wanted to. Before he reached what appeared to be an abandoned welch’s Grape Juice factory, the cyclist felt this twisted amusement yet again, as he laughed. The text states, “It was a sad hopeless laugh, mind you, but at least I still had the energy to feel sorry for myself.” @CAPS1, his suffering was through when he discovered a “fish camp,” with a modern bathroom and working sinks. The cyclist’s relief was so immense that he,” had an overwhelming urge to seek out Gary and Wilber (the owners), (and) kiss them.
2	The setting of this story takes place with a man biking and then taking advice from old timers to a faster route. The biker knew from the start that he should have not given his map. But thinking the old folks knew the route he took theyre advice. What the biker should have done was look for someone to ask and make sure the route would work. But jumping to where he wanted to go led him to dehydration and much more struggle than needed. You should always think things out before you take action, just to be safe.
1	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because he first didn’t know where he was going and took directions from people that he wasn’t really sure about. It was hot he was running out of water he had no idea where he was there were snakes. His water was running out. there were no sings he kept thinking that he would never take directions from an old guys and that he would stick to the future.
3	At first when he gets the directions from the old men, he thinks he will be fine. When he gets to the first town he’s tired and almost out of water, but still thinks he will be in Yosemite soon. When he gets to the water pump in the middle of the desert, he’s tired and thirsty and he realizes that the directions the old men gave him were out of date. He’s really not happy about listening to them and not following his map. When he gets to the fishing place he is greatful for the water in the sink and for the rest and when the old man offers to give directions to Yosemite he thinks he will just use his map. Throughout the story the cyclists needs change from feeling confident to feeling depressed to feeling relived.
8	Could you live a day without a computer? I talk to my friends everyday on the @CAPS1. I learn about current events that I wouldn't know without a computer. A computer also helps me through my daily life. I acknowledge that I should get outside and meet up with my friends, but sometimes when its raining or snowing I just want to talk to them online. Another great thing about talking online is that I can talk to all my friends, not just the one I am playing with. I noticed that even when my friends go away, they can still stay in touch because of their computers. Not only can you stay in touch with your friends, but you can learn about the current events. Whenever I go into @CAPS1 @CAPS2, my @ORGANIZATION1 page comes up and shows me the current events. Without a computer I woudn't be able to see who woll last nights ball game or whats happening with the health care bill. These are important things that help me keep up with things away from my town. A computer also lets me learn mopre about what the healthcare bill actually is and how it affects me. Not only does a computer teach me about current events, it also helps me in my daily life. When I'm eating breakfast, I check my email and look at the weather. During school I type up my essay. When I get home I check the homework and talk to my friends online. All of that is done on a computer. That just goes to show how much I use computers each day. i rely on my computer so much that I would be lost without it and I would get half as much done. I strongly beleive that computers are a necessity. They allow me to talk to my friends when we can't meet up. It keeps me up to date with currents. I think computers have become part of our daily life.
2	In the story ‘Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit, the setting seemed to affect the main character (the cyclist) very much during his pedal, for example, whole the dry desert setting made him think that he could survive with out water, he became dehydrated. The first town, with @NUM1 degree watter could not satisfy his standards. The old velches June factory, was all run down, and is no longer in business, much like the desert, just old barren unuseland. While yes the cycalist survived the pedal, the desert setting opposed a great challenge for him. 
2	There are many features of the setting that effect the cyclist. One feature is that it is getting hotter and it will eventually effect him. The line “I wiped the sweat from my eyes to make sure it wasn’t a mirge.” shows that the heat  might be starting to effect him. Another feature is that he is in the desert and running low on water. The line “I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly” shows that he is drinking a lot of water and is running low. Another feature is that he is riding in the high deserts of California in June. The story says “and I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June.” Not only is it in June, but it adds heat because he is also in a desert. There is no doubt he will get dehydrated. Those are some of the many features that effect the cyclist.
2	The setting affect the cyclist because it creates that deserted atmosphere and helps set the mood of the essay. The mood of the essay I think is a sort of dry summer day, the sort of “oh my gosh, its really hot,” type thing. The setting is a dry summer day in June, with a deserted town, tumble weeds and more to contribut to the hopeless feeling. Although he was secured, and didn’t die, it seemed like he would surely not make it judging by the lack of water, scorching hot sun, and distance, with enduring these conditions. So the setting affects the cyclist in a way that could have killed him.
1	The features of the setting affects the cyclist because the old guys had worn the next town was only eighteen miles down the road. So the features affect reading the story “Do not exceed Posted Speed Limit” was very dangerous and unsafe for people to ride on.
3	The setting effected the cyclist because it was bumpy and had a lot of hills which means he has to work harder. Also because of the heat he was getting dehydrated in the story after the cyclist had Been rideing a long time it says “I eased past trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state “(kurmaskie @NUM1). The cyclist had very little water for his long trip
1	The way the features of the setting affect the cyclist I think is disgardment. First of all, a reason would be because at the beginning of the story when the warning sign is passed, the cyclist disgards it by going down the hill anyways. Also, it states that it “rode into the morning with strong legs and a smile on my face.”
1	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because he went through many ups and downs. At one point flowed by blackish watter feeling somewhere in the neighbor of two hundred degrees.. weather wouldn’t cool down.
2	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because they caused him to need water. He was worn out because the setting was so intense. “Not two miles into this next section of the ride, I noticed the terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills” This quote from the text shows that the cyclists terrain was changing and they affected him.
3	The features of the surrounding landscape affect the cyclist both physically and mentally. First, the sun constantly beating down on the cyclist causes his or her body to sweat more, which makes one’s body use more energy. The sun rays also add to the heat the cyclist feels. Also, the rough road forces the cyclist to pedal very hard, which drains him or her of even more energy. For example, when the cyclist in “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” reached the rough roads, he had to pedal harder, which made him sweat more, and caused his amount of energy to decrease. Finally, the lack of civilization can make a cyclist feel hopeless, which is how the cyclist in the essay felt when he had no water or could see no nearby town. This can affect the cyclist’s will to keep pedaling, and if they have no determination, the cyclist will not go anywhere. The features of the setting can physically exhaust and mentally strain the cyclist, which makes it harder for him or her to keep going
3	Snake, heat, hills-all are what the biker had to deal with because of certain settings. He had to deal with a diamond back. He was going through the desert so it was like @NUM1 degrees. While he was biking he had to go up crippling hills. He had a redicuiou
9	Dear Local Newspaper @CAPS1, I am writing to you about my opinion on the effects computers have on people. I believe that there can be both good and bad effects. Computers make things easier for people, but they are also too dependent on. Man-kind should use books for research also not just computers. Computers are very helpful for people. For example, if you really wanted to see a certain movie but you don't want to stand in line, people can go to movie tickets.com and purchase their tickets. Then, once you get to the movie theater, all that's left to do is walk over to the kiosk and redeem your tickets. Another example is that computers allow people to pay their taxes. There is special software that is able to be downloaded onto your computer. Once the software has been installed, it will usually lead you, step by step, through the process of paying your bills. It's much faster and much easier than paying &quot;manually&quot;. These are some really good effects that computers have on people. Computers also have their flaws. Over time, computers have caused most people to be lazy. Some people have become too dependant on their computers. Business owners, or businessmen and women in general, are @CAPS2 on their laplops or blackberries. Everywhere you look there is another adult on the internet or e-mail. Not only adult's do this though. Students are becoming more dependant on the internet. For every assignment practically, students use google or bing. Sometimes they use or wikipedia. Students should just take the time to use their extbooks. The student body would rather watch @CAPS3, play video games, or text than do homework. This is understandds because homework can be boring but it all pays off in the end. Taking the extra @NUM1 minutes to use a textbook won't kill anyone. No one has died yet from using a book instead of google. Also, in using a textbook, you will understand how to do whatever you're doing. That isn't so bad, is it? Computers, as you can see, have both good and bad effects. It's easy to use the internet for homework but that doesn't really help you. Making purchases is fun though. It saves gas money and time. I hope you and the readers of this paper see my point of view.
9	Dear @CAPS1 man, @CAPS2 would you want people to be on a computer all day doing nothing? How would you feel if no one was out getting excrise, and no one was using the playgrounds, parks and beachs. Everyone will be sitting at home on there nice new fanny computers. When you really do think about how much time people spend doing nothing, just sitting around, @CAPS2 would a computer solve that problem? It really @CAPS4't. This is what I would say to having computers, People spend to much time on computers, excrise is needed, everyday, and it makes your body wear and your eyes strained. When it comes to computers everyone wants to get one, but when we say excrise it seems like peoples mind click off. This happens because people are really starting to spend lots of time on computers. If they work on computers during a long period of the day, @CAPS5 head home to spend more time on the computer, @CAPS5 whats that doing to your body? not helping it. I like computers to and I like spending time on them, when i need to get something done sometime that doesn't happen, because I get and I forget what time it is and that's not fun. Sometime this happens to people they are engaged in there computer, when someone is talking to them and your telling them something you need them to do, and there noding there head like they know what you sayed, but the next time you asked if it got done and it didn't, you know they were listening. Excrise is really important for your body and doens't even have to be to got anything, but don't spend your time wasted on computers. This happens to @NUM1 to @NUM2 or families when they come home from work or school, and jump right on the computers, families are not getting enough excrise or spending time with family because computers get in the way of that. Excrise would help to keep you instead of electronics. Computers are like little robots that control your mind and body, it sucks the life cut of you. It strains your eyes it makes you wrat and you really dont want to do a lot, maybe if people spend less time on computers and more time being more focused on families and nature, they @CAPS4't be weak and tired. I know a lot of people who @CAPS4't want computers to be banned, but I think it would help for a lot of reasons and make families closer and bodys more focused, from my experience computers do help in some ways, but when it comes to real life it helps for really no one. i hope you understand @CAPS2 I say these sort of things, but if you do care about health and activities @CAPS5 you would say that computers are not a lot of help also.
3	The setting acts as a catylist in this story. It is the aspect of the story that is always challenging the character untill the very end. In the story it says “Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.&quot; This is showing that the terrain is opposing him. Also in the story it says “The speed limit was 55. I was doing a water depleted 12 mph. Sometimes life can be so cool.” This is not only showing how much the elements are owning him it also shows how is risle he is, and how satiricle life can be. The ultimate @CAPS1 in this story is when he stumbels across the welches grape juice factory and there was a piture of a boy &quot;pouring a refreshing glass of juice in his mouth.” No matter where the cycalist goes he is alway trying to overcome the elements.
1	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. For example the lack of water begins to take a toll of how fast he can get to the next town. Another example would be the terrain only slows him down more.
2	The features of the setting affect the cyclist by making him use up the last of his water because it’s hot, and than theres no one around because he's out in the deserts of California. “I wiped the sweat from my eyes to make sure it wasn’t a mirage…” (@NUM1.). This exert from the test supports my previous statement about how it’s hot because the speaker tells us how he’s sweating and that he might be seeing a mirage. “There was no one insight not a building, car, or any structure of any kind” (@NUM2.). This shows that there is no one around to help him if he falls down from a heat stroke or anything like that. So the setting is affecting the cyclists endurance.
2	The features of the setting affect the cyclist by making it more difficult to ride. “Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.” “I could drop from heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June.” “a large highway sign jumped out atm.” “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed limit.” “sometimes life can feel so cruel.” The fact the it was such a hot day made the ride seem longer. When out of water you feel exostied. You will do just about anything to try to with stand the heat.
3	Author Joe Kurmaskie learns the dangers of a lifeless wilderness during his experience described in “do not exceed posted speed limit.” As a cyclist riding in one of the most undeveloped areas in California, the lack of water found in this setting proves crippling to his survival. The trails he was directed to had no towns or sources of fresh, drinkable water for days. The combination of constant exercise riding through the terrain, lack of water and recources, California summer weather and lack of civilization trained the author’s energy and caused him to suffer from dehydration. Too much exposer to these conditions could have killed him. The modern time period and year also caused the directions the author were given to be in accurate, and, thus, causing the cyclist to find him self in such a dangerous area of the country. The setting of “do not exceed posted speed limit” places the cyclist in a life threatening situation.
3	The features of a setting could be a number of different things. It could be snowing and cold, raining and of course wet, hot and dry, breezy and humid. The features could be a busy tough or a solitere country road, there could be rough terrain or straight aways. The setting of a place puts pressure of the reality of what will happen on a cyclist. In the essay a young cyclist takes advice from some elderly man and ends up riding through hot sun and ghost towns not knowing if he would survive. The heat had him feeling as though death were coming on him and the thirst had him becoming more determined to get to the next town so he could survive. If the features of the setting had been different, say he was riding on a flat road in a busy town with a breeze and places to stop for water everywhere he would not have feared for his life. The features of the setting affect how the cyclist feels and thinks. He can feel angry, happy, sad or scared and he can start to think about his own death. These have been what I believe some of the effects settings have on cyclist.
2	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. For example when the author says “flat roads were replace by short rolling hills”, that made the author have to ride safer. Also, when he says,” the ridiculously large snake blocked the majority of the pavement.” The author had to slow down on his bike and find a safe way around it so he could get past. Finally when the author says “no one in sight”, no building, car, or structure”, he is affected because he can’t ask questions since hes lost and hes thirsty. The setting makes it hard for the author to maneuver and get to where he wants to go.
1	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because the person who rode the  bike was very tired his legs and body needed a rest after riding on his bike for @NUM1 miles into the pedal. Also it effected the cyclist because of all the riding he had to do struggleing to get where he was trying to get but he was a strong man and he was willing to finish his forty miles of pedaling. He was also restless but he did it.
1	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in, “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” because it goes to many different terrains. The cyclist starts at a town and his working his way to Yosemite when he decides to listen to a group of old men. He started out strong until he got to the first town, which was totally abandoned. He kept going to another abandoned town. He decided to keep going until he saw a sign. The terrain was a lot diffrent with rolling hills and tumbleweed rolling by and a snake. Through listening to the old men the cyclist almost died from the threatening heat and lack of water. The setting affected the cyclist even more seriously than he could have imagined.
3	In the story, the setting greatly effects the attitude of the cyclist. When he starts out, it is an early summer evening, he is serene while he is talking to the old men. He starts cycling the next morning and he is thinking of Yosemite, he is relaxed and confident however, his attitude about the day changes greatly when he comes across the rumshackle old shed, rusty pumps, and a corral at the park in the road. He becomes a little worried but he is not discouraged. When the terrain changes, he is a little discouraged. Then, when he comes across the abandoned factory, he is most definately a lot discouraged. A little later he comes across @PERSON1’s Fish camp, he is very relieved and thankful to the owners. The cyclist’s attitude changed depending upon whether the setting was very beneficial to him or not.
8	Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 I am going to inform you that more and more people are using computers then spending time with their family. I agree with the effects computer haves on people, because one it allows us to access information, two it allows us to interact with people. And three because it helps us updated on what is happening in sports or everything. My first reason why we should use computers is because it gives us information, like the weather reports, school openings, delays, and closings. It also tell's us how @LOCATION1 has been after the earthquake. It tells us alot of stuff. It allow's to go to other websites to find information to. And it allow's us to have fun and play games on the internet. It can help us on our homework. And it can help us find things like job and other stuff. My second reason why we should use computers is because we can ineract with people. We can talk to people weve never ever met before. We can find information about them and tell us how is their life litte. it can help police find info about their criminals and track them down so they can them. It is better and faster than using the phone to talk to them. And it can make people have fun which will make them stay on the computer for a long period of time. My third reason why we should use computers is because it would keep us updated on and for these who love to watch it would tell us the most recent on teams and players. And if you a sports fanatic you can be able to watch live games on the computer. And we can be able to post games and have a chance to see the players talk to their fans. In conclusion this why we should use computers because it can give us information all over the world, two it can allow us to interact with people weve never met before. And three it will keep us updated on sports we like to catch especially if your a sports fanatic.
3	The features of the setting have a great affect on the desperate travels of the weary cyclist. The sometimes disappoint, sometimes uplifting, scenery he passes affect him physically and emotionally when he passes a portrin the road with nothing but a “ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a corral…” he becomes disturbed.  The cyclist is running low on water when he becomes even more distraught at a road with a speed limit posted as 55 mph, when he was, “doing a water-deleting @NUM1.” The setting of the hot, June sun affects the cyclist and puts him in a state of dehydration. In an, “ironic twist” the cyclist is affected emotionally when he passes a @ORGANIZATION1 factory that has been abandoned. The factory features a picture of a boy pouring a glass of juice into his mouth which upsets the thirsty cyclist.
3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist more than anything in the reading of “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted speeding Limit.” In the beginining when the cyclists had just begun his cycling cause he uses a positive tone to describe the setting. For example, in paragraph four he says “the cool pines and running rivers of Yosemite had my name written all over them. “ When he says this the reader imagines someone in an ??? more excited as ??? ??? ??? ??? his destination on a dry day.  As the cyclists attitude becomes lower the reader makes the connection what ?? ?? then because of the setting. In paragraph thirteen when the cyclist says, “I wiped the swear from my eyes to make sure it wasn’t a mirage and that not to get too excited” the reader can make the connection that it is getting pretty serious for the cyclist to continue as is. Overall as the setting changes to “burning sun” and extremely hot, with a shortage of water the cyclist becomes more sarcastic and less upheat. For example when taking about the rocks in his mouth he states “with only luck I’d hit a bump and lodge one in my throat.” This shows a bad mood affected by the features of the setting.
1	The raugher the road gets for him the more determination he has at the beginning towards the end he had the mind set that, “it didn’t matter it was going to die, “this took a toll on him and it was hard to go on. He realyed he didn’t want to die that way and so he kept on, eventually leading to civilisation.   
1	The feature of the setting affect the biker a lot because the rough terrain is described which implies that the biker probably had a hard time half way through the story he said, “Flat road was replaced by shor, rolling hills.” He said this to describe the difficulty in this race. It also makes it seem exciting because it changes things around. It wouldn’t be exciting if they said that flat roads turned into even flatter roads, or if they didn’t show the terrain change at all.
2	Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit.” an essay written by Joe Kurmaskie, is about a solo cyclist going on a journey to Yosemite National Park. So he listens to a group of old guys and ends up lost on rough road with no water, or relylittic supply of flat road was replaced by short rolling hills large highways lon jumped out at me. It read: ROUGH ROAD AHEAD: DO NOT EXCEED POSTED SPEED LIMIT.” The rough road made have to work harder want more water and just made things tougher more than what they already were.
2	The settings of your environment always seem to affect your mood. Take for instance the cycler. In the beginning he had a positive attitude but once he arrived at the first town his attitude started to go down from there. He explains describes the town as maybe at one point being a thriving spot, “but on that morning it fit the traditional definition of a ghost town.” Ghost towns come across very old, run down and dull. That affected the cyclist because by it not being like the old men said he was becoming doubtful, which in turn doesn’t give you the same motivation as when he started. Then when he get to what is suppose to be water and a, “tar like substance oozed out.” That makes him nevers and mad because he isn’t sure he will make it. But his attitude changes as soon as he sees the store. The setting becomes positive and so does he. So, the setting does effect the cyclists mood and attitude.
3	Many of the settings features affect the cyclist. One of the features of the dessert like, which is the setting, is the dry air and hot temperatures. This heat made it had for the cyclist to keep going, with despair the author says, ”I was going to die and the birds world pick me clean.” @CAPS1 feature of the setting was the desolet towns that didn’t contain any water. This lack of the water made it horrible for him to continue on. The thirst was so bad that he had to put pebbles in his mouth to sucking on stones helps take your and off thirst by allowing what spit you have left to circulates. @CAPS1 features of the setting that affected the cyclist was the abandoned Welch’s Grape factory. This  factory gave the cyclist false hope because it would have been so great to have some grape juice during his thirst stricken state. The narrator called the factory.”Ironic  twist.”
1	The effects from the setting that has an effected on me is that while riding on the bike in hot weather with only a little bit of water to drink because I would have giving up have nothing to drink. The water had to be hot.In the text it sayed “I eased past, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state”, I don’t think I could have lasted long, if I was dehydrated. From the look of it I would have drop dead of heatstroke.
3	Many features of the setting affect the cyclist. For instance, in the story, “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” the lack of water in the dry desert gave a long lasting affect on the cyclist. “Wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June simply because I listened to some gentlemen who hadn’t been off their porch in decades, caused me to laugh.” This shows the reader how all the heat and shortage of water has made the cyclist feel very hot dehydraded and that she could pass out any second. She is also thinking beyond that by just laughing at herself and trying to conserve every bit of energy she possibly can. As a result, the affect from the setting on the cyclist is that lack of water has given her humor and courage to keep going, to get to her final destination point.
1	The features of the setting affects the cyclist in many ways. The bumpy roads. Sand in the eyes, thirst hit him too hot and humid tempures. Maybe he got tired of pedaling had to walk. A wild dog chased him went he got in town. Had no money to buy a drink
11	With more and more people using computers. I think that this does not benifit society. I think this because mere cases of suicide are from online bullying, people get @CAPS2 addicted that they don’t exercize and become obeast, and because it is bad for the environment. Now more than ever before people are bulling. But not just showing kids around like they use to. Now the bullies found a new way, by starting web pages, emailing the person, or making threats online. With the internent people say things that they would'nt be able to say in person because you dont have to see face to face all the time. Did you know that @PERCENT1 of all teenage suicides are from being bullied online. The bullies get into that person head and cause them to hurt themselves because they let people get to them. If we didnt have as many people going online then the youth would be more protected from online predilors. As you sit on the computer and play games or to friends, you are most likely caling. Well when you eat and stay on the computer you arnt exercising. Well, more than @PERCENT2 of obeast people say they don't exercise because they are either to tired or dont have enough time. Of course you are going to be tired if you sit for a couple hours staring at a computer screen. When they say they don't have time but yet they spend an hour a day on the computer. That dosnt make much to me. Obeasity has becomea big concern it is the main cause of head problems. @CAPS2 get active The enviorment is a big concern these days. With toxic, the @CAPS1 layer and skin cancer on the rise. But how does the computer? Well computers use energy and let toxix for environment. Killing the @CAPS1 layer @CAPS2 the are much more powerful, hurting people. Yes and plant do help the @CAPS1 layer but when you print you @CAPS2 you @CAPS2 very hard to keep up with the demand of and the demand of the @CAPS3 have to eat, but with out trees, plants they eat? By the time our children's childrens are here, there @MONTH1 be @CAPS3 to no wildlife left, barely any wilderness and without the @CAPS1 layer many people will die of skin cancer. All because we are @CAPS2 addicted to using the computers. People lives, health, and the environment are all big issues that computers help to distore. How would you feel walking into your childs bedroom seeing them on the floor dead from being bullied on the computer. Or see a loved one suffer from heart problems due to obeasity becasue they couldn't get off the computer. Or in about @NUM1 years the @CAPS1 layeris completly distroyed due to the computers, with @CAPS3 to no wildlife left. Using computers does not benifit society. Sure its a quick look up. But @CAPS2 are books. The computer has every thing a local libeary has. @CAPS2 stop being lazy and get out. Put a stop to suicides, obeasity, and hurting the environment.
1	The cyclist of this story is greatly affected by the heat of his souroundings. While he riding to @CAPS1, the heat of the day began to increase. The text reads “ I had been hitting my water bootle regulary. “@CAPS2 to the heat of the day, the cyclist was down to his water consuming large patterns of it at a time. He 
1	When the cycleist mentions how hot and dry and open the terrain is, it makes me feel like he is in the desert. I also know that it’s hot because he is swreating and dehydrated.
3	At first the cyclist feels fine, he gets a little bit discouraged, but basically he’s fine. “The cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite had my name written all over them” (@CAPS1). He feels relaxed, because he is at home with the water and the pine trees. They give him a sense of comfort. He thinks that after the first &quot;tree&quot; not being that much of anything, the others will be better. He knows that he has it in him to make it, but he doesn’t know yet that he will have to travel a long way to get water. When he sees the sign, “It read: ROUGH ROAD AHEAD: DO NOT EXCEED POSTED SPEED LIMIT.” he knows that things are going to get rough, because “the speed limit was 55 mph. I was doing a water-depleting 12 mph”. At that point he starts to get worried, because he is out there more alone, and he realizes that he doesn’t have water. As he runs out of water, the landscape, and his surroundings, start to get drier and drier. He states, “tumble weeds crossed my path.” The landscape seems to get more threatening too, “a ridiculously large shake.” The landscape changes with the state of water.
1	The setting affects the cyclist because the heat and no humanity makes him so crazy. If he was in a place like @LOCATION2. It would be just the heat because there are people every were in @LOCATION2 @LOCATION2. If he was in @LOCATION1 it would be the severe temperature drop and no humanity and he would probably die.
1	the features of setting that the cyclist run into does affect him. For example when the setting changes from abandoned town to an empty deserted rond that no been on in thirty years; gives a cyclist less motivation him self to go on and even less strength.
3	Joe Kurmaskie’s “Rough Road ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” tells how a cyclist takes directions from older men who don’t tell him correctly the way to get to Yosemite, so the cyclist ends up lost with hardly any water. Features of the setting such as the terrain and the sun affect the cyclist in the story. The sun was very hot on a summers day and without water makes it even difficult to keep moving because he was so hot and thirsty. @PERSON2, “The sun was beginning to beat down… I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June” (Kurmaskie @NUM1). The terrain was also bumpy and rough to travel on. The sun and the terrain can affect the cyclist very much when out on a hot day in the summer.
2	The features of the setting taunt the cyclist with cruel irony. As the cyclist continues down his path he pasts through a ghost town, then twenty mile up the road he sees a ramshackle shed &amp; some rusty water pumps. He attempts to get water out because he was runing out but all he could get was muck, then what he described as “water feeling two-hundred degrees, it had the flavor of battery acid. Further down the road was a sign that said rough road ahead, adhere to the posted speed limit of 55, he was going 12 mph. Even worse he found an abandoned juice factory on the way, at that point he was out of water.
2	Do not Exceed posted speed limit, never accept travel advice from a collection of old timers who haven’t left the confinses of their porches sin Carter was in the office twenty miles up the road, I came to a fork as sorrs. I got down on my hands and kness, working the handle of the rasted water pump with all my strength. The water bottles contained only a few totalt and sips. He could or been sad person. And he could just be a bum.
1	The features of the setting could affect this cyclist. In this case it do effect the cyclist. According to the text “Sometimes life can feel so cruel.” This is a good example because he knew that this road was going to be rough and he was only going 12 mph. So the features of the setting did effect the cyclist. 
1	The features of the setting affected the cyclist very much in this. The hot weather made him have a dry mouth leading to the lack of water. He used stones in his mouth and he said, “I’d read once that sucking of stones helps take your mind off thirst by allowing what spit you have left to circulate.&quot; He used that to help him survive the ordeal.
10	Do you ever have time to read? Do you ever spend time with your family? Or do you ever have time to go outside? Well, if you don't, it's because you spend to much time on the computer. Computers are bad for society. And I will show you why. There are many great activities you can do such as reading a book. Instead of reading on the computer, read a novel, you can ask your parents to drive you to the library. I understant that if you need to do research you can do it on the computer but in the library there are all sorts of books such as fiction, nonfiction, science books and many more. Every intelligent citizen would @CAPS1 that computer @MONTH1 have wrong information. I remember when I was doing a project on @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS2 of @CAPS3 music. I used the computer to research who killed her and it said that a man killed her. I went to the library and checked out a book on her and it said that a woman killed her actually. In addition books help you get more accurate facts. Every caring, loving human cares about spending time with their family. How can you spend more time with your family? Well, you can visit some cousins on the weekends. Your family can make parties. I recall having a party for my baby brother's baptism, everyone came. I got to see my aunts, and cousins that I didn't see in years. I understand that if you have a far away relative you would use the computer to chat with them or see them on webcam, but why not take a vacation were they live and go by car, that would bring the family even closer. I @CAPS1 what that is like. My family lives in @LOCATION2 and I visit them every year. We have family reunions, maybe your family can do that too. As a result, family is important, so don't let the computer ruin yours. Do you ever go outside anymore? Is the computer getting in your way? You have to check your e-mail, reply, go on your @CAPS4, its hungry, you have to do your daily activities. What about your health? Getting fresh air can be good. These are many great things you can do outside. For example, you can jump rope, go to the park, go swimming, play in the snow and many more. I remember the time my cousin came over and we went to the park. We stayed these until the park closed. It was very entertaining. Every citizen in @LOCATION1 wants to be healthy. Going outside can help you, run through the woods, or even jump roping is outside and excersizing. In addition just going outside can do more. Now is the time. Why wait another minute? You can either be all alone on the computer or be outside, or be with your family, even the library isn't lonely. Computers are a bad habit, even though we might need them, its better safe, then sorry to do it the old fashion way.
2	The features affected the cyclist in many ways, one being the highway sign, &quot;ROUGH ROAD AHEAD: DO NOT EXCEED POSTED SPEED LIMIT.&quot; The terrain was now short, rolling hills, which would make it harder on the cyclist to pedal up the hills, for it would take a lot more effort and energy. Also, there were roadblocks, “at some point, tumbleweeds blocked my path and a ridiculously large snake “These roadblock would danger the biker, for he’d have to manever around them, losing time and energy, resulting in drinking more water. No water is a great danger for it was June, a hot day and he is risking getting dehydrated. There was also nobody around, so if he desperatly needed water he couldn’t
3	After reading “Do not Exceed Posted Limit” I have seen how the scene of an area can effect your mood and attitude around things. In this story, the main character is a cyclist who takes the advice of a few old men sitting in a poseh who tell him a bad shortcut. As he is riding, he comes across some hills. Those hills really affected him physically he gets tired from peddling up and down continually. “that mood” was replaced by short, moving hills.” The cyclist could not er nuertecy tried everything, not showing how long he have to continue going up and down. There at one point he says, “@CAPS1 can feel so cruel.” There, he is upset because a road sign come up through acid tough roads, and told him not to exceed 55 miles per hour when he was fully going 12 miles per hour. This can be viewed as metaphorical also. When you take a short cut in life, there are always consciences as you decide to drop out of high school is go on how with your journal, where is always the posibility of is not working, and where you cry with no diploma ?? and he gets a job
2	In the short story, Do Not exceed Posted Speed Limit” the setting effects the cyclist in the story. For example, the dry hot air begins to  slowly dehidrate him, causing the cyclist to lose all sense of reason, the heat also played tricks on his mind. Also, the rolling hills exhausted him from working to cycle up them. This, also with the heat factor, caused him to use up his much needed water supply. The setting in this story deeply effects the cyclist. 
1	Features from the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. The area in he was in had a major affect. He was in cali. which is a big dessert. In the middle of some it is very hot. Bike riding on roads in the dessert with no trees or shade of any sort is quet harsh. And to be riding around where there is not much civilazation as to where you can’t get water is a major issue.
1	The features of the setting affect the cyclist, because there is poisonous snake out thre. Your the only person ridin dow those hills all by your self. The guy had said that the next town was @NUM1 miles from where he was at. The lack of water that there were not any streams or rivers around there just in a desert with nothing.
1	The setting is mid summer in California in the desert. It is hot, humid and very dry. There is a lack of water in his bag. He is on a trip, going down the lost, rough and rigorous roads.
2	The features of the setting affected the cyclist because it was a hot June day in a desert in California. For example, your in the desert cycling for many hours very hot and only have limited water. This affects the author because you have to conserve the water that you have to be able to make it to the park. Anothe example, is that you are going up and down rolling hills and you legs get very tired so they don’t want to move any more. And the best example is the sun is beating down on you and your sweating so much and @MONTH1 be seeing thing but all you want to do is see something that has water. These are all things that affected the cyclist very much.
1	The cyclist in the story is running into a lot of problems in this story. For example, the cyclist is out in the summer heat in California riding a bike. After several minutes of this, you will become thirsty. The cyclist brought water but after constant sweating the water supply has nearly ran out. Not having enough water can cause a person to become deyhdrated which then can cause them to pass-out and possibly die. So as you can see, the cyclist is affected by the setting in the story. He has been affected negatively by the heat and by the lack of water.
2	There are many ways that the features of the setting affect the cyclist. For example the cyclist was in a very hot and dry place. Meaning there was no water any where to be seen in miles. Also towns were nowhere to be seen for it would be hard to substain life out there. This quote supports there weren’t many towns, ''About forty miles into the pedal I arrived at the first town.''This shows there aren't many towns in these parts, @CAPS1 so hot and thirsty as the text claims, ''I read once that sucking on stones helps take your mind off thirst ''this clearly shows the  man wa very thirsty. Also shows the man was very thirsty. Also @CAPS1 so hot out there the man could see visions as the text states, ''As the looks ofter had been a grape juice factory and bottling plant.'' why would there be a grape juice factory in the middle of no where. Therefore these statements above show how settings can affect ones mind and physical conditions to the cyclist.
1	The setting that affect the cyclist is the condition of the road because the road turns all different ways and the road goes up hill so it makes it harder to go up the road the cyclist has @NUM1 miles befor he gets to a town he could run out of water. If he run out of water befor he gets there, he might have to make stops so he doesn’t make hisself sick. When he gets to the town he can get more water.
8	Dear Newspaper, @CAPS1 has come to my attention that there is an ongoing debate about the issue stating that not everyone agrees that computers benefit society. I can't understand why. Computers present many oppurtunities for people. They allow for people to communicate with each other, they allow people to research topics in a simpler way, and they teach hand-eye coordination. This is why I agree that computers do benefit society. In the modern world, nearly all businesses rely on communication. Many people in those businesses use not only phones to communicate, but computers as well. Online communication is a fast, simple, and effective way for people to communicate whether @CAPS1 is at home or at work. This is one way computers benefit all of society. Nobody knows everything, we are always trying to find out about new things that we neven knew. Sometimes we @MONTH1 use books, but the way most people use is online researching. This is because not only is @CAPS1 quicker, but simpler as well. When you research online, the information literally comes to you. All you do is type a subject to @CAPS1. @CAPS1 is another reason why computers do benefit society. The final reason is that computers teach hand-eye coordination. This shows because as time progresses while you are on the computer you realize that typing becomes easier. @CAPS1 might take a while, but over time people get the hang. @CAPS1's as @CAPS1 the computer is letting you teach yourself. Some people would say that people spend too much time on computers. This isn't a problem though because people have to spend long periods of time on computers in order to do the beneficial things that computers have to offer. In conclusion, you can see that I have clearly stated the benefits of computers. They allow us to communicate, research, and improve our hand-eye coordination. This is why computers do benefit society.
2	The features of the setting affected the cyclist by making him hot and thristy most of his way. As he rode he started to get tired slowly and he got work and more thirsty. He drank his water at first with out thinking to much or it, but as he went on he slowly found himselfs trying to conseve it. By the time he got to the second wild town the will he was so thirsty and tired thathe thought it might of been a &quot;death&quot; So he wiped the sweat from his eyes.&quot; to make sure it wasn't a mirage. The only time people see mirages is when the are hot,tired, and about to kill for some water. This is what the cyclist was like after his long jouney to Yosemite National Park with the directions given by old men.
1	The features of the setting include “There are no one in sights, not a building, car, or structure of any kind which describes the trail the cyclist was taking. These features of the setting describe how the cyclist is affected because it elaborates on his doubting whetther he will survive or not.
1	Many features of the setting affect the cyclist. The speed limit sign makes him feel like life is cruel. His first glimpse of the welch's Juice factory makes him feel excited. Meeting the deserted fork in the road makes him feel troubled. When he finally gets there, he feels relieved. These are all examples showing that features of the setting affected the cyclist.
1	The many features of the setting greatly affect the cyclist &amp; his performance. For example, the cyclist is riding through a very hot area of California. This is said at the end of paragraph @NUM1: ,“and I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June.” The high deserts of California are windy, sandy, dry, and hot. Not something that someone should be cycling on, had the setting, told of the mountianous regions of California, the wither would hot be hot, or tired because the mountians are a cool, although dry place. Had I had been cycling, I would rather have cycled in a different setting, such as mountians, than an arid desert. that way I would not have to endure the discomfort a cyclist expearenced.
1	The features setting in the story “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” are very important to the cyclist. In this story, the setting really affected the cyclist because it was in California which is a really hot place during the summer. The cyclist had problems because of the weather and on the shortness of water. Since there was a shortness of water he had to conserve it which slowed him down because he couldn’t ride as much. Although there was a cool wind and a river from Yosemite he had to pass quickly down the hill so he had even more problems. This is why the settings of the story really affected the cyclist and how much he could ride.
3	In the story “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” by Joe Kurmaskie the feature of the setting, affect the cyclist in many ways. In the story, it taliks about how the man is pedling twenty miles here and fourty miles there and it's very hot outside and he only has so much water abd he doesn't think he'll make it to where he was to go because its do not that he need more water. As the narrator sas&quot; I was travelling throuhg the high deserts of california in June&quot; which is extremely not in california in June. The deserts hot weather made him eimited on water supply, and the fact that he was in the middle of nowhere, no buildings around makes him lose all hope for making it through. There were snakes in the desert which endagered him, and the bumpy road made it harder for him to hold on and get to somewhere. &quot; I began breaking the ride into distance i could see on te horizon, telling mself if i could make it treat i'd be fine.&quot; This quote shows his struggle because of the area he was in but also his persitance. The features of the setting affect the cyclist in this essay.
1	Many features of the cyclist’s surroundings effect his speed and confidence. He was the only one on the road. There were no other cars, bikes, motor cycles, or even buildings. It’s like he’s on the countryside. So that makes him want to go faster, because he won’t hit any thing. The fact that he’s alone in the wide, open spaces boosts up his energy level and makes him feel more confident.
1	To be able to have a good bike ride, you must have a good setting. To me, a good setting would about @NUM1° outside and sunny. You can’t go bike riding in snow because there is no way that the tires will move in the snow. You can’t go in rain or hail because the roads get slippery and you could getin a accident that could injure or kill you. If it is sunny outside you be able to ride freely on dry roads with a little breeze to go through your hair and you could be refreshed. That is why I believe it is important for the setting to be just right for a bike ride.
2	this story is set in the hot in the hot desert in June and the character is a cyclist trying to get to a National Park. the setting affects the cyclist because the hotter it is the more water you need to keep you hydrated, but the man is alone in the desert. This quote “about forty miles in the pedal I arrived as my first “town”. The place might have been a thriving little syos as one time”. This quote shows how deserted the desert is and how as he rides there is nobody around no where to re-hydrate no where to get drecionsn he was alone.
3	In the essay, “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” by Joe Kurmaskie, the setting greatly affected the cyclist. In this story, the cyclist is heading for Yosemite National Park, thinking it wise, he accepts directions from a group of eccentric old men. He begins his journey confidently on flat terrain and with a large supply of water. The first of three promised towns had been resigned to that of a ghost town. The second offered only water that slightly resembled battery acid. The cyclist soon becomes exhausted from lack of water and having to cross the now hilly terrain. He barely makes it to the third town to realize that the juice factory was out of business. The cyclist becomes sure that he is going to die of lack of water when he stumbles across a bait store. If it hadn’t been so hot, if the “towns” along the way had offered better resources and if the terrain hadn’t been so hilly, the cyclist would have had a very enjoyable ride. All of the affore mentioned factors of the setting greatly affected the cyclist.
8	In this modernized world computers are key. They offer many benefits that enclude communication, enterntainment, and an education. These benefits have positive effects on people throughout the world and are why I support the advances in technology. Communication is a large benifit with computers. Whether you are keeping in touch with friends or organizing business meetings computer offer a large amount of aid. With the modern technology that is provided with the computer, people can instantly send messages to co-workers or friends in a matter of seconds. In some cases businesses completly relie on the computer to function; for example, to have conversation with people accross the globe to discuss they are going to expand internationaly. Computers are greatly necessary for people to communicate and enable people to make plans with simply and effectively. The computer also supplies an endless source of entertainment. With the internet the computer provides the users with websites that enable them to talk to friends, watch videos, play games, and more. The computer provides a relaxing way to enjoy yourself when it is late at night or a rainy-day. The computer enables people to stay entertained, and relaxed when needed. The most important function of the computer is education. The computer supplies the user or student with a wide variety of information. The computer aids the user with vast information on every subject or topic that @MONTH1 be brought up in a class room. It comes to be very useful for research projects or even learning another language. The computer is a very beneficail when ti comes to education. The computer is a technology that has come to make daily life simple. It has come to be incorperated with almost any daily task that @MONTH1 occur during the day. It would be unjust to stop advancing in this technological wonder. The computer is a technology that greatly benifits our communication, our entertainment, and even our education.
2	Hot, terrain, middle of nowhere- all are features of the setting that affected the cyclist. First, the hot weather in California made the cyclist thirsty and almost dehydrated. There was no place to stop for water and if there was, the water was bad and warm. Second, the different types of terrain made the cyclist really thirsty also and tired. Lastly, the cyclist was in the middle of nowhere. He couldn’t get water to hydrate himself or to sit down and rest.
2	The setting for the cyclist is a hard and dangerous one. He had little water, and his area had tough terrains. “I was travelling through the high deserts of California in June” (@NUM1). He is dehydrated and he still has a long way to go. I went on a bike ride that was many miles long  in @LOCATION2, and we did not have water because we could not take a break. The terrain was tough, just like the author’s terrain. The camel he was in was affecting his brain, and he just wanted to get it over with. I am just glad I don’t have to bike in that terrain.  
3	The cyclist in “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed @CAPS1” was riding through the California dessert in June. This dry, bare setting made it impossible to find any source of water. The only time that this cyclist found water was when it @NUM1 and tasting of battery acid. There was nowhere for him to find water for miles. This lack of water and scorching heat made him travel slow and wearily. He even says that he could only go 12 mph in a 55 mph zone. By taking the advise of the old men and taking a “short cut”, the cyclist past through ghost towns with no water. This “short cut” prolonged his trip, most likely by hours If he had gone through populated area despite the fact that it is a longer path, there would have been more water to drink, which would allow him to go faster. The dry, hot setting of the old men’s “short cut” made this cyclist’s trip last much longer than nessiarry.
3	When the man began cycling he thought that this was going to be an easy for ride. For example in paragraph @NUM1 he says “Things began well enough. I rode into the morning with strong legs and a smile on my face.” As he got further he realized that he was in the middle of nowhere. The scenery was getting more and more empty. There was eventually nothing. The scenery was putting down his hope of ever getting out of the desert. For example: In paragraph @NUM2 it states, “a large highway sign jumped out of me. It read: Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit.” He realized this was going to be hard. He had to travel in bumpy roads and pass snakes without getting bit. The scenery created a sense of hopeless because it was abandoned. When he saw the bait shop, his spirits lifted and he was now hopeful and relieved.
2	When the cyclist began his journey he was confident in succeeding. Throughout the story however, the cyclist endures many conflicts to his successs in his journey. The cyclist faced his first difificulty once he reached a small, abandoned town. “I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly, and I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June” (kurmaskie @NUM1). The cyclist realized he had not conserved his water and his “water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips” (kurmaskie @NUM1). On top of his water problem the heat was unbelievable. He was losing hydration from all the sweat, and he was losing it quickly. The cyclist was also dealing with the difficult roads. There were many things this cyclist endured through-out his journey, but he was determined to finish his trip and was filled with satisfaction once he overcame these hardships.
2	The features of the setting put an affect on the cyclist. The first thing would be listening to old men who seemed like they had no idea how far, long, or the condition of the roads where they were sending him. Another thing that affected him would be the road condition, where there were tumbleweeds, and a ridiculously large snake. The second thing that came into play would be the hot weather which made dehydration come into play.
1	One main feature of the setting that affects the cyclist is the heat of the day. If you ride a bike in the heat of the day, you are going to use up a lot of water. Another factor is the limited supply of water. The final factor is the wrong directions from the aged men. Aged people aren’t always wrong but their info. Can be out of date.
2	The features of the setting in the essay affect the cyclist because as he was riding his bike throughout California, he entered hot deserts and was almost out of water. The cyclist was in a very bad dehydrated state as he was riding his bike, looking for water or anything drinkable that would successfully get rid of his dehydration. After a little while, the cyclist found himself alone in the desert with no one in sight. An example of this would be “There was no one in sight,not a building, car, or structure of any kind. Another example to show how the cyclist was struggling and fighting against dehydration is “wise rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that i could drop from heatstroke on a gorgeous day in june simply because i listened to some gentlemen who haden’t been off their porch in decades shown how the settings of this essay affected the cyclist greatly.
3	During the authors ride to Yosemite, he doesn’t have the proper tools to go along the long stretch of desert he was to face, and by tools I mean water. The California desert is extremely hot and can be potentially dangerous depending on your situation the author was describing how the lack of water was affecting him. He described this with sentences like “Rattled around the dry honey combs of my deteriorating brain.” The author clearly cannot face the rugged heat with his immense lack of water. The author was getting neat stroke being passed by @LOCATION2  desert snakes and tumbleweeds. The author was clearly in a struggle against the @LOCATION2 desert heat.
2	The settings and features are very important to cyclists one because water and food try might carry a waterbottle and a snack but they need to know  where they are going and if they will need to bring extra or not. In the story I just read he didn’t bring enough to last him so he got some directions but they were bad so he was in trouble. Its important that a cyclist knows where their going and whats around them so they don't get lost and have no acsess to food or water.
9	Dear local newspaper, I would like to speak upon the topic of the effects that computers have on people. My opion on this topic is that computers do have an effect on people. Most people while surfing the internet don't keep track of time. What I mean when I say most people lose track of time is that, they try to keep track of the time but while on the web something @MONTH1 pop that catches their intrest and at that same time there focus is on something else. Some of the other effects computers can have on people is keeping them in the house. When many people are on the web they tend not to excersise as much. When in the house on the web most people that excersise stop excersising. The reason why this occurs is because while people are on the computer chair you feel so relaxed and calm that you don't want to get up. This leads into eating unhealthy foods. Some such as chips, donuts, twinkies and etc. Some @CAPS1 do not believe that is an opinion. The reason I say this is because while watching television the other day I saw a commercial that said quote &quot;@CAPS2 that are more active are healthier than @CAPS2 that stay on the computer all day. Most @CAPS1 do gain weight on the computer because they are not physically active. Not being physically active can lead to A) obesity @CAPS4) cloged arteries or @CAPS5) lazyness. It can lead to all three because those are the effects of being on a computer every of the day. Most @CAPS1 should be enjoying nature instead of staying on the computer. There is a lot more to life than being on the web. Some such as playing sports. Not only is playing sports fun but at the same tim it is also healthy. Would you rather live to @NUM1 or live to @NUM2. And so local newspaper that is why I am writing you this letter today. I mean would you rather have friends @CAPS2 or be lonely. There are weight surgerys but those can rack up to thousands of dollars. And yes weight loss surgery does have effects such as death. So come on @LOCATION1 its your decison and remember the most important part of this letter which is between liveing healthy and young or dieing unhealthy and suffer. Its your choice @LOCATION1 decide.
2	The features of setting effected the cyclist because he was in a desert in the month of June which was really hot and dry, there were also no trees around so there was no shade for him to relax in so the sun was also beating on his back. There was also lots of hills that took his strength to jump for example it says &quot;over one long, crippling hill.&quot; There was also a big crazy twist in his way. He even saw a snake. All of these things made him really tired for example he didn't have much water and the sun was making him hot and dehydrated. There was no shade so he had to just take the sun beating down on his back. He had to jump over hills so that took alot of energy. He had to ride up one long hill so that also made him tired. All of these things happened back to back without giving him a break, so it really tired him out.
1	In the story it explained the beauty of the night, also about the outdoors and how it is effecting his trip. The features of the setting effects the cyclist, because the setting was mild, sounded warm and calm. Also it showed how it contains to us. The setting was similar to the cyclist. That’s how the features of the setting effects the cyclist.
2	The cyclist was in California in June, the sun was beating down on him this made the ride difficult with short water supply The man came upon several towns that were abandond which made his water supply less. The terrain was long and straight then turned into tall hills which had to be difficult to ride.
3	How the features of the setting affects the cyclist is the condition of the roads, rolling hill, and the?? heat. The conditions of the road in the settings affect the cyclist because the roads are rough. An example firm the texted is “ I noticed that terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short ralling hills. These condition make is hard for the cycled it gives him a challenge.  The rolling hills challange him a regret to stay on the road it is easly tricky and challenges so was The heat &amp; sun was also played an affection on the cyclist. An Examples from the @CAPS1 is.” I chuckled, checked my water supply and moved on. The sun was beginning to heat doing but I barely not ???. the sun was not starting to get him  ?? sharply ??  It will start to get ????? when is ?? is high deserts. I conclude that these features in the setting affected the cyclist in many ways but he keep pushing himself to more on.  
0	In the setting of Do Not Exceed Posted Speed  Limit, is riding a bike really fast on a rough road.
2	The cyclist had a couple of affects in his journy. One of them was he hills the it was a problem because it used most of his energy and slowed him down. The other one was water, the lack of water. If the had enerf water he would have gotten a boost that would have kept him going.
2	In the essay, “Rough Road Ahead: Do not exceed Posted Speed Limit”, the features of the setting affect the cyclist. Firstly, the cyclist had been pedaling through the “high deserts of California”, making a hint that the temperature was hot and dry, and therefore he must’ve been getting thirsty regularly and exhausted from the sun beating down on him. Second, he began to ride through hills, and as common sense would be used, hills are much harder to ride on a bicycle especially up hill, and it wears you down. These hills, along with a lack of water must’ve tired him out and given him extreme difficulty to make it without much water. As you can tell, the difference in setting plays it’s crucial part on the cyclist and his precious water supply.
2	The setting affects the cyclists because he can not take the heat. His water supply is running how and he is dehydrated. It says this when the characters says. “The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips. Wide wings of sweat circled my shirt and the growing realization that I could drop from head strok” This is saying he is afraid he might pass out and die before he finds more water.
2	The setting affected the cyclist in several ways. The first place he arrived at was a “ghost town” Then he reach a water pump about twenty miles up the road. The water was very hot and tasted very nasty. The text states, “…water feeting somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees…when I tried a drop or two, it had the flavor of battery acid. Then he had to travel without water and became dehydrated. Travelling up and down hills he thought he began to imaginate a building that could possibly provide he with water. The building was there but it was abandoned. He decide he was going to such on a couple of pebbles. The text says, “I’d read once that sucking on stones helps take your mind off thrist…”
1	It is my hot so the cyclist is very dehydrated, tired and lack of water. “I checked my water supply and heated on” is a good example oF this. There is also a lot of sad and deserted places with no cars around this bars the cyclists hope of finding civilization. Also not seeing any building and when he sees are it being deserted makes this very hard on the rider. Another event that takes a toll on him is when he @CAPS1 the pump that has tar, dirt, then hot water in it. Also the road plays a toll on him. I know this house he says “If I could just make it to that next horizon/hill I’ll be alright&quot;.This is how I know the setting and features in the setting is affecting the cyclists mentally and physically.
8	Computers are a good benefit to society they you to talk to people give different for you the the latest updates. First they allow you to chat with friends they allow you to message anytime you want. You can talk to people the faraway you lose. For example your friend live the other side of the globe you an your computer and message so you can still talk to them all the time. Also when your bored it will give you something to do. You could see if anyone wants to make plans to hangout. And if you just want to stay home all day you can still interact with people. Secondly it gives you new ideas on things. It shares oppions. Maybe someone bought same they and it did not work you could see the comments and review. Would you want to spend you money on some thing that did network? I woudn't. You can also see majority of people like what they got. Also they make you think of something you would not think about before say you had are mark about how this horrible maybe if you read the page it online it shows what you did wrong what you did not do. It gives you the to try something you @MONTH1 enjoy what you get. Lastly it gives you the latest updates it can share if the sched is closed, delayed, or open. You wouldn't have to wait for the news to show it. It can tell you about crimes that are happening. Also it tells you about your town. Who dont want to know whats going on your own? It tells you new things that are in your town or what their going to make or it tells you what it is getting rid of. Computers are they lot us chat with friends and family. It gives us thoughts we @MONTH1 have never thought about before and they tell us the newest updates.
2	Hot, alone, no water – all are reasons why the features of the setting affect the cyclist. It is very hot as the cyclist is riding. This makes the cyclist feel worried about getting dehydrated. The cyclist is alone and there is nothing in sight. If anything happened to him there is no one to help. The cyclist had very little water and had to conserve it in order too stay active and have energy. With very little water it is hard to stay hydrated. Hot, alone, no water- all are reasons why the features of the setting affect the cyclist.
2	The terrain that a cyclist is riding on has a big affect on them. The first example of this is in they are riding on hills, it makes it much harder for them. For example when the rider in the story saw that he was going to have to ride on hills he was, olcasly disappointed. Another thing that affects cyclist is the smothness of the road they are riding on. In the story “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” the main character came to rough spot in the road and was disappointed and didn’t want to ride it. Another aspect that can affect cyclists is the heat. Several times in the story, the cyclists says that he is tired and dehydrated, at one point he thinks he is going to die of heatstroke. Those are the effects of the rider’s setting have on him/her.
3	The setting in the essay &quot;Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit&quot; has a major effect on the cyclist. The setting is the high deserts of California&quot; where it is June and very hot. The path of the cyclist suggested by some old men makes the heat even worse because there are no people or water in sight. In the essay, the cyclist starts out the day confident and excited for his ride to Yosemite National Park. His mood changes throughout the day as after @NUM1 miles he arrives in a &quot;ghost town&quot; the old men led him to believe would be a settled town where he could get more supplies and cool off. Soon as the temperature rises to what feels like &quot;two hundred degrees&quot; the cyclist begins to run low on water and feels &quot;sometimes life can feel so cruel.&quot; The heat and lack of people and water lead the cyclist to desperation and make him feel like as he says &quot;i was going todie.&quot; The setting of the cyclists journey provides the mood of hopelessness and amplifies the feeling of determination felt by the cyclist to keep going at all costs because he was going to die if he stopped. The author, @PERSON1 uses the setting of the essay to help bring across his mesage that by blindly trustting people instead of trusting yourself things could end up being hard for you to overcome..       
2	In the story “Do not Exceed Posted Speed limit” the cyclist sees many different settings when he left it was early summer and it was pretty hot outside. He rode into the morning when would make him tired. The first town he reaches upon was a ghost town so that means he could rest get his supplies. Then he arrive by cool pines and rushing river which probably makes him feel releaxed. Then he showed up at a ramshack shed with several rusty pumps and a carrol that couldn’t hold in the lamest made. Gated men which people made him feel uncocleible, and the pumps did not give him water so that was nobody also pointing. Then he was rideing through the California deserts in June witch probably made him more dehirrated.
2	The cyclist should have never taken the advice from the older men. The map would have been a lot safer and easier. People seem to always look for a shortcut, including myself. He could have died from heat stroke and lack of water. He did have perseverance though he never gave up and that is what saved him. Being in that situation and setting I would have given up.
1	When cycling it’s important to make yourself aware of the type of terrain it is, make sure of the weather, make sure of the environment, and most importantly make sure of your resources. These things are key before taking any cycling trip. They are very important in determining the type of trip you will have and enjoyable and relaxing trip, or a long and miserable trip.  
2	The features of the setting affect the cyclist by travelling very far where he is going. For example, &quot;About forty miles into the pedal I arrived at the first town.&quot; good thing that he is taking water or who knows if he would of survived or not. I think the biggest mistake was that he asked probaly someone that had not ever been on the road for directions. When he asked the person he ended up at a sign that said Rough road Ahead: Do not exceed, that was the moment I felt sorry for him, and that was probaly the effective feature that has happen to him.
2	In the story “Rough Road Ahead Do Not Exceed Posted Speed” by @PERSON1 the settings of the story effects the rider in manyways. The first and most obvious is the temperature, it is hot, therefore the rider is hot and becoming dehydrated making him thirsty. A second way the setting affects the rider is the fact that nothing is around him. Since nothing is around him there is no where for him to get water adding to the affect of dehydration making him more thiristy. The rider says “One ran shacle shed, sevral rusty pumps, and the corral that couldn’t hold the lamestmal egreeted me. ''This statement from the author support the factt that nothing is around. Onemore feature of the setting that affected the rider was the hills. The hills made the rider tired requiring more pedalind and wearing him out, the setting features had agreat afect on the rider from heat and dehydration to hills and energy. onething that the setting didnt have was a positive affected on the rider.
2	In the story “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” by Joe Kurmaskie the setting affected the cyclist. It was a hot June day and the water supplies he had was running out. He got the wrong directions homThese old men so he would had to ride  his bike longer than he had to and he would need water from pedaling all that way for nothing. Since he was going in the wrong direction there were no buildings for him to get water, there were no people so he couldn’t communicate and there would be no one to call for help incase he was over heated from the heat.
3	In the story, the rider faced several meloncholy sites. For examples the “ghost town” that he ran into at first really put a load on him because he had no one to ask for futher directions or somewhere to freshen up. Futher on down the road the hill he came up on was a physical obsticle that he had to go over. With the sun beating on his back and the emptiness of the road he might have begin to want to turn back. He kept on persaveering which was how he made it down. The lack of water also mad it difficult for him. Traveling with his water running out and beginning to feel sick did not go well with him.
9	Dear newspaper editor, With all due respect to anyone that thinks the computer doesn't benefit society, I strongly disagree. Yes, there are many people that neglect other activities to be on the comuter, and yes, the computer is an invention that a lot of people depend on, but the computer is also an invention that we can benefit from in many positive ways. For example, @CAPS1' @PERSON1, a hip-hop artist with millions of fans, wasn't able to finish high school or go to colledge because of his career. He decided to get a colledge degree, so he started to attend a colledge. He had difficulty being in colledge, however, because he was constantly being harrassed by his fans, so he started going to colledge online. That way, he was able to focus on his studies and get his degree without the harrassment. The computer also has websites on the internet that are used in schools. They help teach students in a way that they will have fun and enjoy what they're doing, giving them a better learning experience. Aside from the positive uses of the internet, the computer also contains progams that can benefit us just as well. Microsoft @CAPS2, for example is a program on the computer that is used to create @CAPS2 documents such as peoms, essays, song lyric, and even letters. You can print out these @CAPS2 documents to have a copy of your ownn to keep and show people wherever you go, but if your not finished, it can be saved on your computer. People use the computer for many things, books, movies and so one. Over the years that its been existance, its benefited us al lot. What do you think?
2	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in a negative way. For example, A tarlike substance oozed followed by brackish water feeling somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees.&quot; This affects him because cant get water from the well. So this means he needs water, but cannot get water. Also in the essay it says the terrain is bad so that means that the cyclist has to pedal harder to keep moving and he has to work harder to hot reek. So all this puts affect on him from just whats around him. The old abbandon factory with the boy drinking juice was had the  most effect on the cyclist because he was so thirsty and that was when he was about to give up. In this essay the setting had alot of affect on the cyclist to were he thought he might die.
2	In the story “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” the setting affects the cyclist in many ways. The speaker tells us that he’s riding his bike in the middle of the desert in June. This shows the author is probably very hot. The author tells us that the road turned into hills and bumps. This would make it more difficult for the author because he would have to use more energy to move up the hill. And lastly, the cyclist tells us that the “towns” he came to were abandoned and uncared for. This would not be good for the cyclist because he would be able to get water for his trip.
2	The @CAPS1 is affected in many ways. The major thing that effects him is the lack of water. Throughout the story he mentions the lack of water. He also continues to say to himself he should not have took that route. For example, “I could drop from a heatstroke on a gorgeous day in june because I listened to some gentlemen who hadn’t been off thire porch in decades, caused me to laugh.” The @CAPS1 says things about the older gentle man throughout the story.
1	Setting very much affects the cyclist and now he feels. If he was in a bad setting then he would most likely be in a bad mood. Mood is highly affected by the general setting. In the essay “rough road ahead: do not exceed posted speed limit” the cyclist feels very confiedent of himself and the setting helps to boost that confiedence and andorence.
2	The features in the setting of the essay affected the author greatly. The Hills, on a hot day, with no water, or nearby town is really rough, expecially if you’ve been riding for more than @NUM1 miles. The environment of the hot June weather near a dessert area can cause serious problems, for example heat stroke and since he had no water to drink dehydration caused a lot of fear in the author. The setting of the essay and the conditions the author were under were extreamly dangerous and hes lucky he made it out alive.
1	That the cyclist is steyetling down up totally end steep within when to get to his destination of the town settle out are taken mean yesterday. The condition in hand and hurry some when and have one his body.  
2	In the short story, “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” the setting greatly affects the cyclist. For example. In the beginning of the story, the cyclist is eager to get to Yosemite National Park. He listens to the advice of, old-timers who haven’t left the confines of their parches since carter was in office, “and quickly realized that he shouldn’t have. The author describes the setting of the first “town” as, “the traditional definition of a ghost town.” This didn’t bother the cyclist as much as his next sight. “One ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and corral that couldn’t hold in the largest mule.” Was what met him there. The cyclist said that “this sight was troubling.” It is obvious that the cyclist has given up hope when he says, “It didn’t really matter. I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean.” This short story shows how anything can get even the best of travellers worried about their survival.
1	 I think the features of the settings affect the cyclist because the knowledge of the cyclist is limited example, “old-timers who haven’t left the confines of their porches since carter was in office”, meaning now its time for the older people to relax and watch of younger people.
2	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because where he is riding it is very dry and hot. He can deal with the heat with his good water supply, but when it runs out he begins to get disoriented. For example in the text he writes “over one long, crippling hill, a building came into view. I wiped the sweat from my eyes to make sure it wasn't a mirrage,” That statement shows that the cyclist was hot, and the images around him making him feel more hot than what he is, and his lack of water made him almost belive that he was imagining seeing a building. Another example is “A sand blasted picture of a young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice into his mouth could still be seen. I hang my head.” This quote shows that the cyclist is in complete despair as he looks at the photo and hangs his head. This shows that the cyclist was constantly being reminded how hot and thirsty he was everywhere he would  go and he couldn't get a drink. This is how the features of the setting affected the cyclist.
2	The setting in “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” greatly affected the cyclist in the story. “Not two miles into this next reaction of ride, I noticed the terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills” (kurmaskie). the cyclist is travelling through hot, dry California in the middle of June without much water left. The fact that he now has to travel up and down short hills is going to make him even more tired, because going over hills requires more energy, than flat riding. This energy, loss coupled with the cyclist lack of water causes him to become even more miserable. The setting of this story greatly affected the cyclist.
8	Suppose you have a family member that you have not seen in a long time and you dont have enough money to visit them because they live to far? Or you are injured or sick and you have nothing to do, so you decide to just browse the internet and you actually learn some interesting things like what new organism has scientist found out or something in history you've never known before? Amazingly, the computer is filled with knowledge like this. You could talk to family members you haven't seen before or just havent got the chance to see them in a long time. You could even know a lot of new interesting stuff about nature and history you would have never known about by just stepping outside. And just so you know more, I'll even tell you about these things. I have a half sister who I only get see like once a year or once two years. But the only way I get to interact with her is on facebook. There is also websites people use to talk to loved ones like twitter, myspace, yearbook, aim, skype ect. Not only do you just talk to them you could do a webcam chat, so you could also see them. Alot of people use webchat to talk with old friends. While on the computer you could also learn new things. Yesterday, when I was on the computer I got bored and did some random searching, and in that @NUM1 min. I learned things I never heard about, like the &quot;@CAPS1 massacre&quot; and that time when a teacher went into a spaceship for the first time and it blew up with the teacher in it. Man was that a tragedy! If you were interested in nature you could learn about all kinds of nature around the world. Also, if you are interested in ancient time with a few typing you got all kinds of fascinating things of ancient time like @PERSON1, the city that was forgetten, then found. I'm pretty sure you couldn't learn that kind of stuff stepping outside. The amazing things a computer could do! Talking with family and friends you haven't seen in which to be decades and learning fascinating things. Usually it's cool because you could learn things your teacher never new.

2	The features of the setting affect the cyclist mood and behavior. First the cyclist sees from believing the shortcut will help him arrive to Yosemite faster then he relies it wont. Next, the harsh sun and rafh terrain and lack of water causes the cyclist to give up hope that he will make it to yosemite and causes him to rethink his judgement and taking advice from others.
1	The setting affected the cyclist in a harsh way. At first, the cyclist was fine and going strong, but soon after the first &quot;ghost town” he was getting weak. Then the cyclist had to face a few problems. For example he was running low on water. Also, he faced rough roads last, he faced snakes and abandonment. The cyclist had to face many obstacles, but in the end, he pulled through strong.
1	The features of the setting affected the cyclist for these reasons. It says “one ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a coral that couldnt hold in the lamest mule greeted me. The sight was troubling.” That showshow how the features affected the cyclist because he says the sight was troubling. It  troubled him because he wanted water and he seen the rusty pumps that reminded him of water but he new their was no water or it was nasty
2	The conditions of the enviroment as well as the road can majory effect the cyclist. For example If some one was riding a bike in warm wheather on flat land it would not take major determination to pedal. On the other hand if it is hot and rough paths and hilly roads the biker colud dehidrate and it takes much more effort to get up and over the hill. Those five the conditions of the enviroment effect a cyclist greatly.
2	In the essay “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” the cyclist, on his way to Yosemite National Park, is forced to face the rough deserts of California. As is normal throughout all deserts, the sun is blazing hot, as is the sand. There is no water anywhere and dangerous, highly venomous creatures are abundant. The lack of water almost puts him into a heat stroke as he is determined to leave the desert, riding his bike all alone. A grope juice factory taunts him, mocks him, but he continues on, with a steady pace. The desert roads are rocky and bumpy and his lousy 12 mph speed is getting him practically nowhere. Until, finally, he reaches a modern area and drinks from the sink in the bathroom.
2	In the story the setting plays a big role in effecting the cyclist. The terrain was very hard at times such a big hills and windy torns. Also, there was no one around. no houses, buildings or people which made him fell alone and life he was going to die. The author describes the terrain in one part of the story “Over onelong, crippling hill a building came into view! This quote shows how the hills in the seting were very big and hard to get over. It also shows the significance of a single building and how excited he was to see it. In the story the author described many features from the setting which all greatly effected the cyclist.
3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist, by putting him in unwanted places starting off with this man took advice from many older men, which don’t even know the area anymore. So riding through this man seems lost, he is trying to follow their advice, but comes across many unknown, unwanted areas. He starts out good, then comes to a “Rough Road” and he even says “sometimes life can feel so cruel”. Then he come to this large snake in the middle of the road scary enogth he has to slow ride past this thing taking up most of the road. Coming over these thing was very strong and hard of this young man.
2	The dessert environment had huge effects on the cyclist. He had been drinking his water regularly and would be running out. Not realizing, their would be no refills because the pump was only giving “ tarlike substance” said the text. With the lack of water dehydration was beginning to hit the poor man. An effect of dehydration is poor balance that would have been useful to pass the “ ridiculously large snake” he had seen. A finale effect would be mirages that could loose your judgement. This man double checked his eyes, when coming in view of a building, by “[wipping] the sweat from (his) eyes to make sure it wasn’t a mirage,” Through all the toughest desser obsticles the character was able to take the short cut and survive heat, dehydration, and animals of the dessert.
3	I think the features in the setting of the story &quot;Do not exceed the speed limit, by Joe Kurmaskie, highly affect the cyclist. Some implied a information would be that it is very hot out, and the people in towns didn't help him. I know that it is not because the text says,&quot;somewhere in the neighbourhood of @NUM1 degrees.&quot; This implies that it is very hot outside. I can tell the people in towns didn't help him because the text says, &quot;Never accept travel advice from collection of old-timers who havent left the confines of their porches since carter was in office. &quot;This shows that the people in towns didnn't help him. Some expressed information in this text would be that there is a rough road, and a shake was in his way. I know this is expressed because it tells you right in the text. &quot;Rough road ahead: Do not exceed posted speed limit. &quot;This comes right out and tells you there is a rough road. You know there is a shake because the text says, &quot;and rediculously large snake blocked the majority of the road. I think there are many implied t expressed information in the story&quot;do not exceed the speed limit. 
3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist in a larger way, almost resulting in a very sevior situation. The cyclist was in a desert. Like terria, which was not dinsely populated on his trail, there was a lack of fresh water supplys, and the tempatures is more extreme. The cyclist could easily have faintid from heatstroke, due to the lack of water and excessive heat and work that his was doing peatling. Had the area been more populated, he would have had more chances to stock up on water greatly indecriasing his risk of heat stroke. There was also the snakes which presentid danger for him, has he been bitting then he would be at least @NUM1 miles from the closet help which could proven fetal. Had the setting been, say a city park, on a populated country side, them thi setting would had provided exponeutaly loss prodioms and dangers for the cyclist.
7	Some people think it is a good idea and same do not. My opinion is that, I think that people spend a lot of time for good reasons. Here are three reasons why, @NUM1. grownups working, @NUM2. students learning how to type, and @NUM3. communicating with others. My first reason is that parents do a lot of work on computer. For example, they do taxes, paperwork, airline tickets, and the bank. And those are usually all done on the computer so it would be easier if people don't drive. My second reason is students need to learn how to type so they can email or even write on paper. It helps them build learning ability and also, so they can know how to sing the @ORGANIZATION1's. Computers are suppose to be fun for people of any age. My last reason is, communicating with others is a great skill to have so you can talk in person. Computers help because if you mess up of what your trying to say then you could just erase what your trying to say. And in person, you can't. Also you can make plans with one of your friend on something if they live really far or something like that. In my opinion. I think people should be able to go on the computers to do work, playgames, no sites, and many more other things to go on, only if you have a computer at home.
9	Dear @LOCATION1 @CAPS1, I believe that computers do benefit society. People are able to read, shop, and play online. This makes life easier for many people. Buying books that you would like to read can get expensive. With the internet, people are able to read almost any book right on their computer. In a recent survey, it was found that people who read books online save an additional @MONEY1 a year more than people who buy books. People can also read things like newspaper online. If there is snow on the ground, and people are unable to get their newspaper, they can read it online. This way they will know if a newspaper is still good, and continue buying it, including the @LOCATION1 @CAPS1. Additionally, people are able to shop online. Sometime, someone @MONTH1 have been an accident injuring them, and they are stuck at home. If it is a child, their parents will be unable to go to the store because they will be caring for the child. They can simply go on the computer and have food and other necessities delivered to them. People can also do this if they have a busy lifestyle with work or school. @PERSON1, a physician, told me that people who shop online have @PERCENT1 less stress than people who go to the store for the same items. He said that is is because they do not need to worry about taking much time out of their schedule to shop. Moreover, the computer is a good way to quictly play games. Young children can be very loud and energetic. Parents can just let them play games and read on the computer. Little kids love just the fact of being on the computer, and letting them go on can keep quiet and occupied for a while. Even just typing is interesting for younger kids. For older kids, there are many games that can play. Action, strategy, puzzles, and many more. They can also play against people around the world. The computer is fun for everyone. So in conclusion the computer is a very good place to go shopping, read books, and play games. Computers greatly help families of today.
2	The conditions and features of the setting caused the cyclist to be tired and dehydrated and think that he was going to die from it. For example, it says “and ther growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke on a georgus day in June”. Also , he thinks he is getting dehydrated when he says “I  was doing a water depleting 12 mph. sometimes life could be so creul”. in conclusion, this cyclist started this without enough water causing him to think that he was going to die from either heatstroke or dehydration.
2	The setting affects the cyclist because he’s in the middle of nowhere with no water. The cyclist had to ride his bike for over @NUM1 miles trying to get to Yosemite. “I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly.” This quote shows that he just beginning to run of of water. “The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips.” This quote shows how he really had nothing to drink at all. Having no water in the high deserts of California while riding your bike for over @NUM1 miles is not a good @CAPS1 unless you have a car. 
1	In the essay the setting had every thing to do with  the cyclist cause he is ridding through the desert with batey tay water. He is pedaling through the dry heat thats tough even you had water pluse there were hills deadly snakes.Its dangerous enough with out that stuff being there. So I would listen to the cyclist &amp; never ever listen to old men.
2	On the cyclists rideto Yosemite National Park he encouters a lot of hardships due to the setting hes around and the advice given by oldmen. The cyclist riding his bike in the middle of June in the deserts of california isnt good to begin with adding to cyclist dehydration state. He first come to encouters ''one ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a corral that couldn`t hold in the lament mule'' By that description oF his lecatracy it seems as if he might be in ghost town by himself almost could strand him. He described the terrain with “short, rolling hils.'' and ''over one long, crippling hill.'' This shows some of the obstacle that he had to go through in a bike, just to get to Yosemite National Park. He @CAPS1 realized once he encounterd these Features oF the terrain that he was oFF track and needed to find help. After his survival of his surroundings For as long as he could go, @CAPS1 gets help at a real camp. That is how the settings of the story play role in the cyclist epidemic.
3	“Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” is an inspiring and almost humorous essay it take the reader inside a journey in a cyxlist daily routine. In this story the author fights dehydration as he tries to make to a national park with shortcut directions from “old timers” the setting of this storygreatly affects the cyclist and the pitty the reader feels for him. Half way through the essay, the biker had already traveled roughly @NUM1 miles; that’s extremely crazy. The fact that he is travelling through California deserts in June is even harder to believe. The first time he mentions the setting, he states he is in a ghost town, two sentences after he states that the sun was beating down. At that point he wasn’t really bothered. Another description of his setting that probably affected his ability to peddle was when he states “flat road was replaced by short rolling hills.” He was already dehydrated and had already traveled so far, the rocky roads probably didn’t help his journey much. The setting basically made the story. If he wouldn’t have been peddling in the desert, it would have just been another trip in his life. The setting makes the reader see what cyclist really go through. 
1	The features of the setting affect the cyclist a lot. It does because the road is not in good condition and he has to travel a long distance with the bad weather. This affects him because he might get dehydrated. In conclusion there are many things in the setting that affected the cyclist.
1	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because if they weren’t hills and rough roads, he would of been able to get to yosemite park faster and he wouldn’t of ran out of water.
2	The setting was the main affect on the cyclist. He said it was hot and that he was lost. The cyclist had no clue were he was going and it was hot out side. He seemed very strest and that only made it worse for him. He was thirsty from all riding and the heat so he trys to get water from a water pump. The water that was in it was horable. He called it a “substance” it had a flavor of battery acid. “If he were not lost and if it were cool outside he would have water and he would not be so upset. The setting of a hot and lost place had a huge impact on the cyclist.     
1	In my opinion the features of the selling affect the cyclist in many ways. For example, when he was talking abut the terair changing from long strat roads to shard winday one and the speed limit changing he said.he was doing a waterdepleting @NUM1 fuier sands like he is having a hard time, or doesn'twnt to go on.
6	My opinion on the effects computer have on people. A good effect that computer have on people that it teaches them how to have good hand-eye coordination @CAPS1 if they work as a doctor on anything that needs it that would help them do better in their jobs. Another reason why computers have good effects on people it let them chat with their famile memebers case if your family went to a whole new countries for a trip then you beable to see how there doing and it's like there. Another one would be that you could learn about another states and countries around the world.  It tell you how many people like there and what type of culture they have when it found probably now when I want to learn about texas I look up information on it and tell me when it was found the capital and how many people live there. Another good thing that you could play games with your friends like all types shooting games racing sport arcade all type.
2	Due to the features in the setting, including the hot summer weather, the cyclist not knowing the area, and the California desert the cyclist is affected. In the short story “Do not exceed posted speed limit” by Joe Kurmaskie the cyclist is travelling through the hot desert in June when he realizes hes running out of water, “I had been hitting my water bottles pretty reguarly and I was travelling through the high deserts of California in June”(Kurmaskie). This is affecting the cyclist because hes becoming hot and has a low supply of water. Also the cyclist realizes he should have never taken the direction from the old men and thinks to himself, “…The growing realization that I could drop from heat stroke on a gorgeous day in June”(Kurmaskie). This quote proves that the heat of the desert is taking a toll on him.
1	The setting of this story affects the cyclist alot. I think the setting was supposed to be most like a run-down out of dated town which didnt help him when he was lost. The town is out of date and hot. Which bring another problem, the cyclist was dehydrating because he didnt have enough water. He would hilusinate and see things that werent there. He become very tired in the hot sun. So the setttling in this short stories effected the cyclist in many ways.
2	The feature's of the setting affect the cyclist because the condition's he is in without any water. the cyclist would be fine if he would have had more water for his trip. He ran out of water not to for into  his journey thanks to the heat of the setting he was in. the cyclist makes this statement. I was hitting my water bottle pretty regularly and I was traveling through the high desert of California in June”. The cyclist is saying that since it is so  hot where he is he has to take regular drinks of water so he stays highdrated throughout is trip. It is also saying that in the mountians with less air and how hot it is he is not doing as well as he thought he would on the trip.
2	The cyclist had a hard trail to bike in order to get to @LOCATION1. It is easy to bike if you are on flat smoot terrain, when you get to rolling hills, it makes it a lot tougher. The biker said “I noticed the terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills. It was also very hot. he was sweating and getting dehydrated, “I’d read once that sucking on stones helps take your mind of thirst.” he had eighteen miles to next town without much water. The first deserted town didn’t have any drinkable water. It was very hard to bike in these conditions, and is important to always be prepared and know were you are going.
1	The cyclist has to endure ruff treain and bad road condisions and a lack of water is the ??? near did not help the prodlem. Ther was a good prasority he could have heat strock then his hope was stll up by a abonded welches take factry.
3	In Joe Kurmaskie’s “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed @CAPS1” the imagery is what sets the cyclist back. The scorching dessert and plant life gives him a sense of seclusion and scares him. Because the cyclist is in the  dessert he keeps on worrying about his water and heatstroke where as if he where in a rain forest he wouldn’t worry about water or heat. I think he siked himself out just by taking in his sorroundings. If the cyclist would have pictured water all around him and arctic like temperatures I think he wouldn’t have been so worried. What’s interesting about this story is that if he would have gotten himself prepared mentally for the conditions he wouldn’t have struggled so much at the end. “At some point tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake- it really did look like a diamond back blocking the majority the pavement in front of me.”(Kurmaskie @NUM1). If the cyclist word of concentrated more on the task at hand and less on what was going on around him I think he would of succeeded without as much stress.  
1	The features  of the setting affect the cyclist in that it made him use up his water supply and tested his determination. “ Sometimes life can be so cruel” implies that he was having a horrible time coping with the setting he was in. To himself he thought be was gonna die at any moment.
3	In the essay “Rough road ahead: do not exeed posted speed limit,” the author is continually depressed, by the features of the landscape he passes. At first he passes a ghost town, but because he has enough water, this sight doesn’t bothe him. But the next thing he sees is a rundown old shed and a “rusted water pump,” and this troubles him because he is running out of water. Then he sees a huge snake which does not help his mood, because the snake is blocking his path then he passes an abandoned Welch’s Grape Juice factory and despairs that he will never find water. The setting its features serve to dissappoint depress the cyclist in his quest to find water.
1	In the story “Rough Road ahead; Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” a cyclist is faced with many problems. It’s really hot out, practically a desert and its in June. Just knowing that makes me want some water. Also this cyclist is running short of water and still hasn’t got to the place he needs to be. The roads are hills and bumpy which make it harder for him. Those are the problems this cyclist is faced with.
3	At First the narrator in Do not Exceed  Posted Speed limit was energetic enthusiastic  about their journey to Yosemite national Park .After getting some helpful advice about a few short cuts the cyclist sets out for adventure .First thing they encounter is ghost town .The gentlemen they a taken advice from had assured them it was booming prosperous town .This set the first wave of doubt through the cyclist mind .Then lack of water began .They were travelling through the high desserts of California in June and slowly running out of water .Flat road was soon replaced by short , rolling hills which only increased the cyclist state deliriousness .After a few more dissapointments the cyclist decides there is no hope and they are going to die .The reader is partly drawn in believing that this is the end for the cyclist .All of the disappointments set the stage for the end of the cyclist and you can’t stop reading because you have to find out what happens.If it weren’t for the hopelessness of the setting you wouldn’t care.
6	I don't think that computers is the most positive effect. Because most computer's are not like that the computers are not the smartest but it does help you when you need to do something like a project when you have to look for pictures and when you need help with math you can use the calculator on the computer but the computer does not help you on all your subject's the computer only help's you on a couple of your subject's that is the main reason I use the computer. Sometimes when I'm doing homework I let the computer do it for me so it is eaiser for me to do and I look for website's on it they give you really good website's that is why mostly everyone use's the computer they mostly use the comptuer to look for job's, car's, or a house that is what they mainly use the computer for most people do not like useing the internet because they think it's cheating to use the computer.
2	When the cyclist is going on his trip, he is riding through as desert. All he sees the entire journey is a flat rode and dirt. He is riding on the road; hopelssly hoping for some form of lif. “There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind. “The author is trying to be positive but it’s hard, because all this scenery is doing is bringing his hopes down. How would you like it if you were riding a bike and had no water in the middle of a desert. Now, if the setting had been a nice, green forest, he wouldn’t be that worried, there’s water and shade. He has none of that in the desert. This whole journey was all mental. He always kept in his mind that everything would be ok. That is what helped him survive. This is an ispiring story, to anyone who needs a push to stey optionistic.
3	Poor directions heat, and lack of water affect the cyclist in the story. At the beginning of the story, the cyclist is confident in the directions which would, “slice away hours from my ride to Yosemite National Park.”  As the story progresses, the cyclist is no longer so confident. The “heat of the California, June day causes him to be fluent in drinking water.” I had been hitting my water bottle pretty regularly, and I was travelling through the high deserts of California in June.” This lack of water is a big problem for the cyclist, so big that he was near heat stroke. “I eased past, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state. The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips.” He braved the elements and forced himself on, with hopes that any source of water would reveal itself to him. His perseverance paid off. “Then , as easily as rounding a bend, my troubles, thirst, and fear were all behind me. The cyclist had found a barst shop and recteved water.
1	The features of the setting affect the cyclist. I say this because the setting is in the hot deserts of @LOCATION1. The cyclist is sweaty and tired and has almost no water left. This lack of water makes the cyclist desperate for food and water. The setting has a lot to do with how the cyclist reacts to what happens.  
3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist in many ways. First, because there was no one in sight he couldn’t ask for any help or direction. Also, because of all the road conditions it was hard to ride a bike through all the rocky roads and he was very tired and dehydrated so that didn’t help him it just tired him more. Another reason is because of the poisonous snakes if he disturbed them they could harm him. Also, if he would had fallen off his bike a snake could have biten him and then he wouldn’t be able to make it anywhere because of the bite. Those are the features of the setting that affected the cyclist.
2	The features of the setting in the story affect the cyclist both physically and mentally. It affects him physically because of the rolling hills he has to trudge over and the lack of water he has. The rolling hills make him tired and weak along with the rough terrain. The lack of water doesn’t help any when he’s thirsty because of the hills. The features affect him mentally because the farther he goes the more dalerious he gets. Each more mile he keeps telling himself, if I can just get there I’ll be fine. He also blames himself for listening to the old men. And with this also came doubt. He was doubting that he could make it alive. In the story it says, “it didn’t really matter: I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean&quot;. mentally he couldn’t make it.
1	When the rider was riding his bike in such day settings has started to need water he was running out, So his whole adventure was to find water. Being thirsty was very hard because it made him not want to keep going because he was so tired. It made him harder on him. But it also got him more strength and because in himself, and keep on pushing. 
3	”Do not Exceed the posted speed limit” tells a story of learning and determination, as one cyclist bikes through the deserts of California,  encountering obstacles such as snakes and a lack of water along the way.  The descriptive features of the setting greatly affect the protagonist along his journey. The essay takes place in the early summer. As the cyclist prepares to retire for the day, he takes particular note of “the serenity of an early summer evening,” and ends the day feeling calm. The next morning he is excited and rejuvenated, ready to bike again. The heat rises as the day goes on, and by mid-day the cyclist begins to worry about his water supply. He boldly continues forth reaching new terrain, rolling hills. Here he begins to lose hope, and is disappointed when he seem the “town” he hoped to find is an abandoned juice factory. The cyclist thinks he is going to die due to the heat and lack of hydration, but gathers his strength to turn the final bend, and reaches a bait shop where he can stop and get water, he is finally relieved. In conclusion, as the cyclist continues his journey through the California desert, the change in both weather one terrain coincide and affect the cyclist’s change in physical and mental strength to continue traveling.
1	The features of the setting affects the cyclist in many ways. For example, the story said,&quot;I gathered up a few pebbles and stock them in my mouth&quot; This quote explains that the setting was very and had pebbles. The setting benefiting him by taking the thrist off his mind. If their wasn't any pebbles by the cyclist he @MONTH1 not have made it. In cocnlusion in the story Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit the cyclist was benefited by the features of the setting.
0	The features of the setting affect. Any cyclist   because with the cyclist passed many time in the bicycle had problem on his/her back  when he/she will be older. When they will be a older person and they had passed many time in the bicycle, they will had a serious problems and also they will can not walk  more.
2	The setting in the essay “Rough Road ahead; Do not Exceed the speed limit” affected the narrator in many ways. The first thing that affected his ride was the heat. at first he didnt really notice but then it began to slow him down. Then the ways of the roads began to affect his ride, the roads went from flat sheet to short, rolling hills.” The road change and the heat made him say “I could drop from heatstroke.” Then because of the old towns he went through he was unable to get water. The water pumps were so old and unused for so long that the water was of very poor quality.
8	@ORGANIZATION1, In ones opinion about computers and what they can do to benefit society these days. Ones opinion about what the effects that computers have or people are that they can benefit us in many ways for example they can communicate with people around the world for example many people @MONTH1 have friends or family that live in another state or country computers can help us communicate with them. Commputers alow us to help us learn what we couldn't learn from books. Computers can help us with learning such as learning about or the population. One might think that is good but its slow with computers you can send emails and have the person on the other end reply instantly because of computers. Computers have benefited society in many ways. Computers in ones opinion about them is that they can benefit us in many ways we wouldn't think of being possible. Before computers and printers we had in use type writers and if you messed up you would have start again and it could take hours or work to get the paper perfect but with the worlds modern we would don't have to type whole paragraph over again if we make a mistake we can just hit the back space button on the keyboard so it won't take us hours to type one page or when it take half an how at most so computers have benefited us in more way than we know it. So in ones opinion about computers and what they can do to benefit us is that they allow us to do things we couldn't have done before the computer was invented. The computer was a great invention and it is benefited mankind as we speak and that it is that hard to set up. So in ones opinion about computers and what they do that can benefit the society that we live in and also benefit mankind as well.
2	The complex features of the setting affect the cyclist negatively throughout this story. His trip goes from bad to worse as he progresses to Yosemite. After taking directions from the “old codgers,” the author attempts the shortcut, but is dissapointed. He arrives at the first town but it is completely deserted. He rubbed it off though, and kept “the cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite,” as his motivation. He pedaled on, but began to run out of water when he arrived at a well, he found the water to be inedible, and continued. Just as if things couldn’t get any worse his trail was getting rougher, and his water supply was low. The cyclist was becoming dehydrated, and began to lose hope. He became even more of a pessimist when “a ridiculously large snake- blocked the majority of the pavement…” He kept going, and excitedly pedaled toward a building, but found it to be abandoned. He even put rocks in his mouth to help his dehydration. When he finally found the fish camp, he was relieved. All the obstacles he prospered through were worth in the end.
3	The journey of a solo cyclist is a lonely one. The cyclist in “Do not exceed posted speed limit” had a particulaly hard journey, as made even worse by the setting. His main opponent in the battle of staying alive was the heat. In the California deserts as a day in June. It was no surprise that the sun would be heating down particularlly harder than it would at another place anytime. Also, as the terrain became hillier, his journey became even harder. There is nothing hard about biking in a flat straight line. But constantly peadling yourself up steep hills and around winding roads is no picnic. Just like the buildings around him, the cyclist’s water deteriorated as did his state of mind as his trip which started out very joyful became increasingly more mardid. “It didn’t really matter, I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean. This cyclist was fighting against strong forces of nature.
2	In the short story, &quot;Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” by Joe Kurmaskie, the setting plays an extremely important role. The story takes place in sunny California, where the cyclist was pedaling around 12 mph. the heat made his dehydration situation much worse.  “I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean.” The cyclist was losing hope, yet he was still determined to find water. This setting was very important to the story, for if it had taken place at @LOCATION1, @LOCATION3, it would not have made sence. The setting contributes to the story by raising the intensity of the situation.
3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because they started to mess with her mind. She didn’t knew where she was and on hip of that got lost. Whether you see nothing around. You or alot around you, you’re going to feel scared. They have the same affect. In the authors case, she was cycling and didn’t/couldn’t and water. This is an over whelming feeling because you can die from dehydration. She then kept cycling and saw nothing. “no one insight; not a building, car, or structure of any kind.” That is alatining no water or people around, as if you are going to be just left to die. These settings would affect anyone who came across them. They dffinately affected the cyclist because she was by herself, and on her dvun. Plus, all she had was a map, her bike and an empty water bottle.
1	The features of this story tend to affect the cyclist very much. Because he took a shortcut he had an even longer journey than before. He was in the middle of no where with barley any water left and on top of all that he’s exhausted from all the hills on the terrien. So because he took a shortcut it ending up costing him in the long run.
2	The features of the setting in the essay affected he cyclist because first of all he lisined to old fowks that hav’nt left their front porch in about ten years. Then he didn’t ask someone elses apirean on where to go and how to get there. His worsed mistake tough was not trusting the map he had with him the howl time. If he would have just trusted his map and not when with when the old fella said he wouldint have almost died of heat stroke.
2	In the essay, “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” by Joe Kurmaskie, the setting affects him negatively because he was on his bicycle and he was in a hot area and no water whatsoever, like  in this quote, “I  got down on my hands and knees, working the handle of the rusted water pump with all my strength. A tar like substance ozzed out.” In the quote, the cyclist finally thinks he has found a water pump but he really gets nothing. Also, another negative thing is that he thought he was never going  to get to where he was going, but in the end , he got there and he got some water.
2	The setting in the story affects the main character greatly because of the heat. The main charater is biking throug a desert in the summer with little water. The heat of the setting provides a problem because the main character is at risk of dehydration and heatstroke. The main character knows that if he passes out in the barren desert he will sarley die. The main character says, “The growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke.” The main character is faced with a problem of man versus nature and the heat is winning. Heat and dehydration sap the main characters energy while he is biking through a desert, desperately trying to make it to the next town. In summary, the main characters biggest problem is the heat of the setting.
2	The setting around the cyclist affected him in one main way. “About forty miles into the pedal, I arrived at the first “town” (Kurmaskie). The cyclist put the words towns in to parentasis because it was actually a Ghost town. no on lived there, It was abandoned. Around the cyclist was deserts, and more empty towns. The father the cyclist got, the more we realized the old men were wrong as the cyclest was running low on water and there was no where to stop. He finally found some and vowed to never listen to old mens directions again.
2	All the feature of the area have a have a big affect on the cyclist. It is a hot June morning, and he is on his bike, pedaling hard, going many miles. He can't find any water, because all the towns along the road are deserted. He is getting dehydrated, and losing strerigth. It seems like he might have collapsed it he hadn't thought he was going to @CAPS1, and if he hadn't gotten some water at that store. All in all, the setting seems to have the intention of king him.
8	Dear @LOCATION1, I believe that computers benefit society very much. I believe so fo various reasons that I will state through out this passage. Although sometimes people spend too much time on computer it doesn't mean computers are bad for society it just means people need to learn to spend their time wisely. Overall I think computers have a positive effect on society. One reason I am for computers is because they are a huge advancement in technology. They are able to make everyday life easier. They allow you to store information. Learn about many places, and communicate with friends and family. For one device to do all that is amazing! Also if we can make something like computers imagine all the other possibilities of technology advancements. Computers are only the start of it all! Anouther reason why I believe computers greatly benifit society is because they provide entertainment. You can watch movies on your computer, and download fun games. There is hardly anything you can't do on a computer. If it is cold outside or raining you can still entertain yourself with just a computer. Computers are very great to have around. Now anyone who thinks people spend too much time on their computer and that computers are bad for society is just wrong. I think those people are wrong because a computer can't force you to spend more time on it. It's your own fault if you choose to use your computer too much. You always have the choice to go outside and take a walk. Computers are only wrong if you choose to use them wrong, like the expression &quot;guns don't kill people, people do.&quot; In conclusion I believe computers are a great thing to have espicially in this modern society. Computer are one of the greates advancements in technology and they benifit society as well. So if you are ever wondering weather or not to buy a computer I suggest you get one!
3	The features of the setting in “Rough Road:Do Not Exceed the Posted Speed Limit”by Joe kurmaskie affects the cyclist in a very negative way.It begins slowly with the “ghost town”.The narrorator “chuckled, checked my water supply and moved on,” he wasn’t especially worried,but the fact he checked his water suggests that he’ll need to ration it for a while.The decline continues when he reaches the fock and the “ramshackle shed.”@CAPS1 the description of the place shows you he did not like it,and he confirms that with the words,“this sight was troubling.”He wouldn’t be replenishing his water here.Any more of this he’d be dead,either from dehydration or from pessimism.Eventually he reached the road sign which declared that going over 55 mph was a bad idea.This is ironics,he only going 12 mph to put it in his own words,“sometimes life can be so cruel.”He quite obviously hates the setting,and it’s all the fault of the setting.
2	The features of the setting affected the cyclist because he had limited water, he had to peddle harder to get up over the hills and he was getting dehydrated from the heat. For example, he had limited water because he had taken the directions from the old men and probably didn’t bring as much as he would have if he would have taken a longer way. Furthermore, to get up the rolling hills he had to peddle faster and harder. That affected him because he would have been more exhausted from peddling. Moreover, it was a June day and in June the days are hot with the lack of a good amount of water the cyclist would have started to get dehydrated. This is how the setting affected the cyclist
2	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. For one, his body heat raised a good bit. They don’t come out and say it, but they do say, ”The sun was beginning to beat down.” We all know that it your out side when it’s hot, you get hot too. It also probably added to his dehydryeon. As a long distance running, I know what the sun will do to you during a hot day. That is how the setting affect the cyclist.
1	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in a major way. For one, if the desert was not a deserted mountainous area, in California then the cyclist would not have the same problems. By changing anyone features of the setting you would change how the cyclist would behave in the setting. Thus changing the entire plot of the story. If the cyclist was say in the entry or a mere develop area then he would not face the same dangers as if he were in a mountainous region. The settings features have a huge affect on the cyclist.
3	In the story “Rough Road ahead: do not exceed posted speed limit” by Joe Kurmaskie the feature of the setting seem negative to the cyclist. The setting seems to start worrying the cyclist two miles after he said that he could make the next @NUM1 miles easily. For example the cyclist says “Not two miles into this next section of the ride, I noticed the terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short rolling hills, “the cyclist seems worried at that point that things aern’t going to be as easy as they seemed they were going to be. From that point on the setting seemed to get worse for the cyclist later on the cyclist ends up saying “It didn’t really matter. I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean.” That was when the cyclist began to notice his fear of dehydration. The cyclist ended up making it and he realized what a big effect nature can have on you.
2	The features of the setting affect the cyclist by unexpected things happening. His water supply got drank quickly and he couldn’t find a town near. He was in the desert-like California, and the sun was beating down on him. When he did one town, it was more of a “ghost town”, and had rusted pumps that had battery-oil tasting liquid. Every person he asked told him is near, but from dehydration, it took him longer. the roads got windy and small hills occurred. There was a large snack in the middle of the road, as the tumble weed blew by. the finally saw a town that had a bait shop and was able to get water and cool down.   
3	The setting in “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not @CAPS1 Posted Speed Limit definitely affected the author. The cyclist states, &quot;Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills&quot; (Kurmaskie @NUM1). The cyclist probably found it more difficult to navigate  through the &quot;hills&quot; as opposed to the &quot;Flat roads,&quot; making him more quickly tired. The speaker states, “I could drop from heatstroke” (Kurmaskie @NUM2). The speaker is implying that it is so hot outside that he could faint from a ‘heatstroke’ which could slow him down. The speaker also states,&quot;water feeling somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees&quot;(Kurmaskie @NUM3). The author did not have any good water to drink, because it was so hot outside, which affected him in that he was dehydrated. Many aspects of the setting affected the cyclist.  
1	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because if the old men didnt give the boy advice then he probably wouldnt have run into all the trouble he ran into. At the same time the boy made his way to were he was going. Next time though he will just use his map so he dont have to go through the scare of death again.
1	The features of the setting affects the cyclist by the road’s condition being rough as the cyclist rides further along the road.
3	The setting of this short story has a big affect on the cyclist. Since the story takes place in the desert, the temperature is very hot. The cyclist only packed enough water for the intended trip. Since he made a few wrong turns, he ended up needing more water. There were no signs of civilization so he could not stop any where and buy water. He came to a “run-down” rusty fauret and tried to drink water from it, but it was hot and tasted like battery acid. If this short story had a different setting, then the story would not make much sense. For example, if the story would have taken place in @LOCATION1 he could have just stopped and bought water. The setting is one of the most important elements in a story.
9	Dear Local Newspaper, I think computers have a positive effect on people. The reasons for my answer is that there are many homework helper websites, the computer helps you learn about places you've never been to, and you can even interact with people all around the world. These are my three reasons on why I think computers have a positive effect on people. First, I think computers have a positive effect on people because there are many homework helper websites that struggling students can go on and get tutored. I remember in @NUM1 grade when I had a math midterm. I was having a hard time understanding the math. Then, I went on a tutoring websites and they taught me everything that I was having trouble with. I think that the computer can help many kids obtain good grades. This is my first reason why I think computers have a positive effect on people. Second, I think computers have a positive effect on people because it can help you learn about far away places that you have never been to before. This would be useful for a school project on a country. Also @PERCENT1 of students in my school say that the computer ha s helped them a lot on school projects. The computer could also be useful for planning a vacation. Would you want to vacation to a place that you know nothing about? That is where the computer can help. All you have to do is search your destination and pictures and info will come up so you can make the right choice. This is my second reason why I think omputers have a postive effect on people. Lastly, I think computer have a positive effect on people becuase you can interact with people around te world. I have a brothter that lives in florida, but I can talk to him every day on the computer. Also, I can keep in touch with my friends anytime I want. I think computers help people develop better social skills. This is my last reason why I think computers have a positive effect on people. In conclusion, I think computers have a postive effect on people for better grades, learn different things, and talk to friends.
1	The features affect the cyclist in many ways. For example the road, the rocks everything close. The cyclist needs to know everything about where he's going, because if not then he can run into some problems along the way, For example like snakes, rough terrain, rocks in the way. That why its important for a cyclist to never listen to anyone but themselves. That why when you see cyclist you see them around, a road where theres cars around, just in case they get into trouble.
0	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because It give it more life. More meaning and make I fun to read.
1	At times when the features of the setting are bad it can have a great impact on the cyclist. For one if it’s too hot the cyclist is going to need plenty of water if he/she does'nt want to be dehydrated. There are also the dangers of heat strokes and deadly snakes, cyclist might want to avoid that. When your a cyclist times can be hard just prepared for the long run.
1	The setting in the story “Rough Road Ahead Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” really goes against the cycilist and his journey. This is because in the places he goes there is no water and if there is it is really hot or bad water. For example, on page @NUM1 it says, “a tarlike substance oozed out, but the water wouldn’t cool down,” This explains how bad the water was when the cycilist was there.
1	During this essay the author is talking about his journey
2	The feature of the setting included nice cool pines and than a gost town and it bein hot out and banser of @CAPS1 and posine snacks and hills that where getting harder to go up. When he first started the pines where nice and cool but when he scan the gost town he sot dischriced than it started to set hot and than he seen the snack and thout that it was a dimed baby and was nuvves and than he was carid of dehydration than the hills started to make it harder and harder that is what it was like.
2	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because he has to use more energy to pedal up hills and through rocky terrain. Therefore he drank more water. When he coudnt.
3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist in several ways. The first was the terrain, which started out flat, then turned to hills. The cyclist was growing tired from all the pedaling. “Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.” This tired him out faster, since going uphill is harder than riding flat terrain. The heat definitely affected him, because it made him thirsty. He was “travelling through the high deserts of California in June.” This is a very hot time of year, and when a person get lost without conserving water, which he had not done, a person get extremely thirsty. Not to mention the “sandblasted picture of a young boy pourng a refreshing glass of juice into his mouth,” which would remind the body of its thirst. So the setting most definitely affected the cyclist
3	In the story, the cyclist iS greatly affected by the features of the setting. For example, the setting has no thing for miles. Just ghost towns, makes it imposible to find any water. Also it’s a desert like setting, adding to his thirst. Another example is the hills, that made him even more thirsty. It was June in California so it must have been pretty hot and also the town that he are to had no water because they seemed desorted. Another example is the state he put under his tongue. It’s a trick that lets you survive alot more effectively. Therefore the settings affected his journey and made him wish he didn’t take the old mans advice.
2	The features of the setting affected the cyclist in many ways. Three features I found were the lack of the water, the heat and the conditions and limits of the road. The lack of water really affected the cyclist. When he was died tried he/she didn’t have anything to drink. The essay stated how would say she/he would save the water til the end. He /she was so tired so the lack of water really affect him/her. The conditions he/she was in really affected the cyclist also. From the beginning he/she was told the wrong directions. That was the reason why he/she was lost the entire time. Finally the limits of the road affected the cyclist. Hills and different grounds did not help the cyclist. In conclusion, the cyclist had many factors affecting him such as lack of water, limits of the road and his/her conditions.
8	Dear editor of The @CAPS1, I believe that computers are good ideas for our community. If the library's closed and a students needs information, you can look it upon the internet. Also, you can talk with your friends if your phones not working. Computers can help people learn about the latest news if the television is getting pixecl. First of all, computers can help with research alot. Let's say it's ranning healthy, your car? out of gas and you need to go to the library before it closes. Just be easier to go on the computer and find a research site about your topic; no gas wasted, no sopping wet doing just you in a robe sipping hot choclate on the computer. Next, you can talk to friends all the way in another country without having to pay extra for a long distance call. And if yo udon't have unlimited minutes and you went to talk with someone for a long time, you'd be wasting valuable minutes and money! This is where computers come in. You can just open a chat window and talk away, just like that. Finally, you can look up the latest news and information on a search program, like @ORGANIZATION1. If your television broke and it'd take a week to fix, what if something happened that you needed to know about you could just go on the internet and look it up. Thank you for reading my ideas, editor. I hope you'll choose my article to post in your newspaper when the time comes.
2	I think that the features of the setting affect the cyclist greatly. First, I think the weather conditions affect him. I think this because in the passage it says, “I could drop from heatstroke”. Meaning, its really hot! Also, l think the fact that he has no water left is affecting him because it says in the passage, “l eased past, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state”. This has a big affect on him, because he’s very thirsty. Also, l think the fact that there is nothing around him is affecting him. I think this because in the passage it says there were no cars. I think all these things affect him.
3	In “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” by Joe Kurmaskie, the setting affects the cyclist. The cyclist takes advice from some old guys and ends up wishing he never did. He is on an empty road, flat and dry. He ends up drinking all of the water he has, and needing to stop for some more.” I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly, and I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June.” He stopped to get more water, but once, all that came out was some tar like stuff, and then he couldn’t find another place for quite a white. The flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills and he came to a sigh that said “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Speed Limit”, and passed tumble weeds and a large snake. All of these things impacted his journey with fear, caution, etc. When he finally reached a place to get a drink, he was finally satisfied. Because it was hot, and empty, he was more thirsty so therefore the setting affected the cyclist.
1	He feels alone there is noune around him to push him, and yet he keeps going trying to push him self to the end to win. The fast roads are rough and the hills are tall but he is a determined to finish.
2	Heat, abandoned roads, snakes all are reasons that affected the cyclist. The heat made him get dehydrated faster while he was using energy. The long abandoned roads further increased his doubt of living the whole bike ride. He used up allof his water. So when he got to the old pump hot dirty water came out. The snake in the story made the journey for this guy perilous and deadly. This all happened because he listened to the old guys. When the other old guy was about to tell him whereto go he said no.
2	The features and the setting affect the cyclist a lot. One reason was that he was in the desert. Like in the quote “through high deserts of California. This means that it was hot and he could pass out from a heat stroke. Then he couldn’t even get any water. Like on the quote “of the rusted water pump.” it was describing how old it was then the cyclist got some out but it tasted like old battery acid. Therefore the features and setting afected The cyclist.
3	The features of the setting intensely effect the cyclist over period of time. Destined to reach yosemite national park from Lodi, California, a determined cyclist rode strongly through the gentle evening strongly. When the setting changed, so did the effect it had on the cyclist. When the man reached the first town, which was deserted, energy began depleting because the sun began to come into the picture. next, he came to a shed desperate for water only to find rusty pumps with tainted, unsafe water. When the flat terrain turned to rolling hills, the man was entirely exhausted”. With what I believed to be my last burst of enery, I manevuered down the hill”. That quote directly describes what the man was feeling and how the hills effected him. When the man stumbled across a fish camp with water, he became reloaded and replerilshed with confidence he had before when he “rode into the morning with strong legs and a smile”
1	The setting affected the cyclist in many ways. For example he was riding in the desert and all the towns he was going to were abandoned. The month was June a hot month and the sun was beating down on him. And he was cycling with very little water.  
3	In the essay “Do Not @CAPS1 Posted Speed Limit” the setting effects the cyclist in many ways. When the cyclist arrived at the first town, he described it as a ghost town. This effected the cyclist because he started to have doubts about the directions he received, but he was looking foward to the cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite so he persevered. The setting of the next land mark was similar to the last. There was a shed, a few rusty pipes and a corral that &quot;Couldn’t hold in the lamest mule.” This made the cyclist more werry of the path ahead because he was running out of water. The next place was also similar. There was an abandoned @ORGANIZATION1. The cyclist was running out of water and now thought he was going to die because everything was deserted. Then, finally, the setting changed. There was a store that was actually opened. The cyclist then felt happy and relieved. That is how the different settings effected the cyclist.
3	The author’s setting described a difficult terrain and harsh weather for bike riding. The author said that it was early summer which means it could be hot and uncomfortable weather for the cyclist. The author also that when the cyclist reached the first town, the sun began to heat down. That means the temperature is going to rise since the sun is getting stronger. Riding a bike in hot weather is very difficult because it takes a lot of effort and makes your body dehydrate faster because the heat makes you sweat which lowers your water retention. Another feature of the setting that the author described was the cyclist’s location. He was traveling through the high deserts of California. This gives you a sense of how much hotter it is since he’s traveling through deserts during early summer while the sun is high. After the first couple town, he starts to ride on short, rolling hills. Hills take a bigger toll on a person’s body because it takes more effort to pedal up a hill.
2	The features of the setting affected the cyclist greatly. Fem the ghost town to the bait shop, it was all a challenge for him. A misleading challenge , But a challenge . In the desert is were water grew short and he tried everything to push himself. From staring at the horizon to get to a place to another from sucking on pebble stone to not focus on water. And when he arrive at the bait shop. A sense of relief came to him, like that shop was his safe haven. But yet he would never get directions from any old-timer again. Lack was not a factor in this story. Rather it was drive and overal climate of the story. When it was two –hundred degrees left, and no water left, he pushed himself to the light. And also when he saw a building he was determined to get to it.
8	Fairfield @CAPS1 @CAPS2 computers have a bad effect on people? Many people say &quot;yes&quot; and many say &quot;no.&quot; @CAPS3 a matter of fact, computers @CAPS2 have a bad effect. People are very easily distracted on computers, it wastes time, and it causes stress. Many kids who @CAPS2 there homework on computers are very easily distracted. With computers come the internet, and with the internet comes games and social networking sites. Many kids would rather chat on facebook with a friend than @CAPS2 homework using an online book... including me. When I get home, I start using the online text book for my math class. But when I wait for it to load I get bored and go on online game website. After that I get too distracted on this addicting game called &quot;@CAPS6 @CAPS7 @NUM1.&quot; And @NUM2 hours of playing online games I realized I have wasted a lot of time. I realized I have been wasting a lot of my math homework time lately with those online distracting game. And @PERCENT1 of my grade in math is homework I've gone from a @CAPS4 to a @CAPS5+. And why waste time on the computer. Outdoors are just @CAPS3 fun @CAPS3 &quot;@CAPS6 @CAPS7 @NUM1.&quot; I'd rather be playing football with my friends than that dumb game. My parents have also realized that I've been wasting so much time on the computer they've blocked the internet. But distracting games that waste time also cause stress, which could be fatal. Imagine being in the hospital because of playing on the computer. Once while I was watching the @ORGANIZATION1, a man said @NUM4 people died because of playing on the computer for over @NUM2 days with little food or water. My parents also notice that me and my brother are grumpy after playing on the computer for so long. And I've been stressed lately. Overall, computers have a bad effect on people. Distracting games are a waste of time and cause stress. Hopefully people understand this message and you shouldn't play on computers for too long.
2	The cyclist was trying to make it to Yosemite National Park. The cyclist was in Lodi, California when he decided to ask for directions from old codgers so that he could take a short cut. He followed their directions and little did he know that he should have stuck to his original directions. The cyclist was traveling through the high deserts of California in June. The cyclist became very hot and thirsty from traveling in the desert. It says in the text “when I tried a drop or two, it had the flavor of battery acid” This shows that he had no water left to kept him dehydrated throughout his travel. Also in the text it says “with what I believed was my last burst of energy, I maneuvered down the hill” this shows that he had no energy left.
2	In the essay “Rough Road Ahead ;Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” by Joe Kurmaskie he goes through all kinds of settings where the going could get better or worse. “I noticed the terrain changing, flat roads was replaced with short rolling @NUM1 Kurmaskie). This shows or explains that the going could get a little tougher now because he will have to be riding up hills and he is almost out of water. “There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind” (@NUM2 Kurmaskie). This explains that the man could not get water or a ride from anywhere around, because there was nothing out there to at. This is how the setting features affected the cyclists.
2	Almost all the features of the settin affect the cyclist. For instence the fact that it is hot causes him to drink a lot of water and need a lot of water. In the story it goes on about how thirsty and sweaty he is. “The water bottles contains only a few tantalizing sips. Wid rings of sweet circled my shirt.” These description suggests that he is very hot since he is sweety and hes been drinking so much. Another feature of the setting is the rolling hills that make him feel like he is never going to reach the next town. “I began breaking the ride down into distress I could make it test for.” He is making the ride seem like a lot of short rides so he could make it.
1	The setting is described by the author, were very challenging for three reasons, distance, water and the heat. All of these only occurred to multiply the effects of the others. As time had went on, the cyclist grew tired from the heat. In one sentence the effect of the heat were clearly described by the cyclist
1	The features of the setting effect the cyclist in many ways. The scenery makes the cyclist turn worried, unconfident, and in the end an ironic hopeful. The cyclist came upon the first “town”, and described it as only having “one ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a corrall” I believe this is when the cyclist realized the men were a little off, and began to worry: he also couldn’t refill water supply, so fear of dehydration also kicked in already tired, the cyclist became unconfident when he came upon the sign reading, “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit”. Knowing that this was going to be a long and slow journey, the cycles becomes unconfident that he can make it, finally, when passing the sign saying, &quot;Gary and Wilber's fish camp – If you want bait for the big ones, we’ve your best bet,&quot; the cyclist reached a hopeful stage, because he knew he had found civilization once again. I believe your atmosphere and surroundings can effect your general mood, and that stands true today with the cyclist.
2	The way the features of the setting affect the cyclist is by either making the ride easy for him or tough for him. In the essay it said &quot;No Town&quot; but without a town theres no water and water @MONTH1 lead to dehydration. It also says something about flat roads turning into &quot;short, rolling hills.&quot; This means that the way he had to go was tough and making it hard for the cyclist to stay focused. Those are some examples of the setting affecting the cyclist.  
1	The setting affects the cyclist becuse it is the passes is on a road much alot of hills it would affect him as being tired, or if the biter was in a place where the cold or hot it would affect him or his temp. and by his attiude.
1	The settings in this article effect the cyclist by having to bike a lot of miles to get to the next town. The cyclist has limited amount of water and its very hot out. Theres nothing insight for miles and miles.
1	The futures of the setting affect the cyclist was that he show the maD to other people and he shouldn’t (ister) to others where he had it to go.
3	In the essay “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” many features of the setting affected the cyclist. And these setting could be easily formed in the middle part of the essay. And these settings caused the cyclist exsaused on his journey. First, the cyclist noticed a rode change from flat to short, rolling hills. He had to spend more energy to go up the hills which caused him to loss a certain amount of  energy. Then, his lack of water caused him a dehydrated state. He could loss an another large amount of energy by this and out of this stage, he mostly needs someone to support him or be on his side, but he was riding alone, there was no one on sight, not a building, car or structure of any kind. This might cause his emotion break down to make his energy to loss. Overall, the cyclist suffered a loss of energy on his journey. And was unable to have a supporter to help
6	Dear who it @MONTH1 concern, I think that computers are very affective but then again they are not because would you rather have your kids on the computer or lets say some children smoke and some hang out in the streets to much yeah it does do a lot affect to them. In my predictionI say computers are very addictive but then again it really isn't because there are some people who really don't like being on the computers for a long time cause it gets boring and it starts to hurt you eyes. I will understand if they don't want to get off when it passes there bed time. Some kids do a lot of bad things out in the street and hang out in the streets a lot, but when they go on the computer it can stop some of them from doing those things. A lot of kids have myspace and facebook ... and more and it is the best way to stay in contact with your family and friends thats one of the main reasons kids go on and there is other electronic devices that stops kid from exersicing and stuff like that such as a psp go or xbox @NUM1 or ds, dsi playstation @NUM2 and @NUM3. So I think it is an addiction and it affects kids but the things you'd rather have your kids do keeps them away from doing it.
1	The setting affects the cyclist because it can provide landmarks and directions. For example, the narrator states, “They’d sounded so sure of themselves when pointing out landmarks and spouting off towns I would come to along this breezy jaunt” (Kurmaskie @NUM1). This shows that the landmarks can provide as landmarks and directions along a journey.
2	In the story “Rough Road Ahead: Do not Exceed posted speed limit “the cyclist has some very rough obstacles on his way to Yosemite National park. With his lack of water and diredness he runs into a big snake that he thinks is a diamond black. He easily passes the snake and moves on. Being in the intense heat and with know water he never gives up and knows he can make it to the park safely. The reason why he go's this way is because @NUM1 “old-timers who haven’t left the confines of their porches since carter was in the office”. These guys gave him wrong directions. That really affected the cyclist because all of the other stuff wouldn’t have happened if he payed attention to his surroundings and people around him.
3	The features of the setting effect the cyclist on different occasions in different ways. For instance, when arriving at the first town, the author calls it your average ghost town but continues on with confidence. The next building he saw was an abondoned Welch’s Juice bottle factory, on the building was a singn with a boy drinking a cold glass of juice. This intimidates the reacher the begins to question the wisdom of the old men. Continuing on he reaches another building. To his relief its a bolt shop that was still in business. He goes to the sink immediately to drink the water at this point he is relieved to have water $ be near civilization instead of in dessert without a sight of liFe or building. Therefore his surrouding throughout the story make him indifferent, confident &amp; relieved.   
1	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because the roads are rough, uneven and he has to push out more energy to pedal his bike on rough, uneven roads then on nice, paved, even roads and also he is out of water so there again is using all his energy without any redaveanator.
1	The setting affect of a cyclist can be petty complicated. So many things has to be prepared for you to be a successful cyclist. First up have to be prepared for the weather. For example when there is serious weather conditions like rain,snow you have to careful of ley roads.Also they have to be prepared for is long riais. Some naes might be from @NUM1 miles the have to bring plenty of food and water. Also anothe affects that a cyclist has to tase is the condition of the bike. For instance he/she has to make sure the bikes are in good condition and is going cooperate. Also if work need's to be done to the bike then the bike can be worked on.Also another affect of a cyclist is the cyclist is in shape. For instance if the cyclist is in shape he/she is able to ride for a long period of time. Finally another affects is the cyclist has to know where he/she is going. For instance the man in the story didn't know where to go so thats an important keypoint.
1	The setting of where cyclsit takes there journey effects the cyclist. The reason I say that is because in the story “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” the cyclsit came upon a conflict with the setting. The conflict waas it was very hot and he did not use little things to survive witch he did. These are the reason why I say the setting of where cyclsit takes their journey matters.
3	The setting in the short story; “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed speed Limit” greatly affects the cyclist. The rough terrain and blazing sun test him and make him suffer in ways he never imagined. One point, after the cyclist has been going for hours he notes, “Over on long crippling hill, a building came into view. I wiped sweat from my eyes to make sure it wasn’t a mirage…” this setting has caused the cyclist to become so dehydrated that he can’t think. The cyclist knows the dangers of the setting around him. As you can see the setting has a very strong affect on the cyclist.
1	The cyclist was affected by long hours of riding the bike into the areas where he never been.
2	In the essay “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit.” The cyclist is affected by the setting mently and physicly. For example the setting affected the cyclist mently because it all was dessert and sand with no water. He thought he was going to die, he said “I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean.” If he had some water he would not have thought this. Also the cyclist was affected phyisicly because the road was rough it looked as it could go on forever. He was losing energy and was getting tired from riding up all the hills with little water left in him. It was hot and it seemed hopeless but if he was riding through the evergreen forest I don’t think he would have felt this way. In conclusion the cyclist was effected by the setting phyisicly and mently if he had not been riding in the desert he would not feel this way
3	In the essay, “Rough Road ahead&quot; the character sees many settings through his ride, all of which affect his mood and physical condition. For example, when the author describes one place he came to as, “one ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps and a corral that couldn’t hold in the lamest mute greeted me. Thes sight was troubling”, this was the turning point where the cyclist began to worry. He was running out of water, “The sun was beginning to beat down”, and he was probably tired of pedaling. But, to make matters worse, he came to rolling hills. This affected him because he had to work harder and had less water to pick him up. When he finally got to a “modernized” town his spirits were lifted, and he was able to get water to cool him down. This gave him more strength and will-power to continue his trip Yosemite park.
12	Dear @CAPS1 Society: Computers are perhaps one of the greatest improvements to our societies advancement in knowledge in the past few decades. These gems of future, are like a human being; they have their own mind and can figure out answers to all problems. People all around the world use them, from @LOCATION5 to @LOCATION4, to @LOCATION2 to @LOCATION1, they are being used. People from ages of school kids, to adults who have a job so highly appreciated as a chemist, use computers! Do you wish to be that one standing on the side lines, stuck in the past, not advancing with technology? From the creations of rockets, engines and planes; computers have never let us down. Still, the question is this: will computerized technology benefit our society or crash it down? Ever since the @DATE1, computers have been used as an ad for new information. The speed that they are able to recieve new information in is just astonishing! @CAPS2 @PERSON2, computer engenieer, says &quot;With the technology that we recieve from computers, we are able to be in the game.&quot; @CAPS2 just comes to show one of the best benefits of computers: their ability to display the most current information. Now, I can see how books are an excellent resource in society, and how they provide for amazing information, however it takes years to publish books! With the use of a computer, information that occured sometimes as close to @NUM1 hours ago can appear on the internet! Not only will this allow you to get information faster, but it will allow our society to &quot;be in the game.&quot; You catch a football as it soars through the air, you track a baseball or it flys high in the sky, you grasp the face of a basketball all because you have &quot;hand-eye&quot; coordination. Hand-eye coordination is perhaps one of the most neccessarry aspects of life that a person can have. Face it, everybody needs it! So why not help your body to get that talent: buy a computer. Imagine, our society would advance in it's sports and even just with life if they learn how to coordinate themselves. Did you know that @NUM2 out of @NUM3 people who owned a computer and typed daily were able to catch all three tennis-balls that were thrown at them! You could do that too! When typing on a computer, human development observers states, your eyes a free tracked on the screen and you train your hands to manuvor about the keys all by themselves. Just as in basketball, when you train your hand to track the bounce of the ball without you needing the need to catch it. I can remember when I started typing, my hands began to naturally find the keys without me having to look at them. And the next day at basketball practice I felt like @CAPS3 amazing point-guard @PERSON1, the ball just came straight to my hand! Get this need of life, invest in a computer! Money @MONTH1 be the most vital thing in our society right now. With profits as low as medium wage, our local area is not that &quot;rich.&quot; I can see how it could be hard, having to purchase these computers at prices as high as @MONEY1 each. But then just think, each book that we won't have to purchase would save us @NUM4 each. Not only do computer's stand to last @NUM5 longer than any paperback, their information is always new, changing, and up-to-date. In order for us to be purchasing new books because of recent information would end up coasting as more in the long-run. Our neighboring society of @LOCATION3 just invested in over @NUM6 comptuers for their society. The stated that it took onlyt @NUM7 months to get the money back that they had purchased on the computer's with the amount that had not purchasing book! Now just imagine how much money our society would gain after @NUM8 year! It is necessary for our society to have computers. With them we not only learn hand-eye coordination but we invest in more money for the. And now with so many things happening in the world it is important to recieve information instantely from these computers. I can't stress enough that without them we just @MONTH1 be less in the rest. Dreams of incrediable rockets and medicines and cures far diseases just won't happen. Computers rise perhaps the only thing that actually benefits our society. You must understand how important this technology is to our society! But, int the long-run, the decision is yours is make. Choose quickly, the fate of our society is in your hands.
1	The setting of the story has a huge affect because it was such a empty terran that made him rely on only himself because of the lack of others to help. For example, if he was riding through a city for hours he could stop and take a break in a store or get water from about any where. But being in the desert it really tested his inner strenght to go on and get to safty.
1	In the essay I can conclude that there were many features of the land that affected the cyclist. For example in the text it states “ridiculously large snake…blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me.” If you are greatly afraid of snakes that could ruin your whole trip. The cyclist was scared but over came the fear and moved on. Also another thing that changed the cyclist was the lack of water. Not having enough water could be bad. As stated “I could drop from heatstore on a gorgeous day in June…” There are many features that effected the cyclist and his journey.
2	In Joe Kurmaskie’s, “Rough Road Ahead Do not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” there are several features that effect the cyclist. “..and I was travelling through the high deserts of California in June” (Kurmaskie) Deserts in June are extremely hot and dry and caused the cylist to become dehydrated quickly. “Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.” The change from flat lands to hills made the ride more strenuous on the cyclist. These conditions directly affect the cyclist.
1	The cyclist was trying to get to Yosemite National Park. The cyclist was riding through the deserts in June. The cyclist barely had water at the end of the stony. A lot of buidings were abandoned, right when he needed water. That is how the setting affected him.
1	In the essay rough road ahead the setting does effect the cyclist because he has been pedaling for so long and he is becoming dehydrated “I had been hitting my watter bottles pretty regularly. I was in the @LOCATION1”. Another reason the setting effects him is because he is starting to see mirages “A sandblasted picture of a boy pouring a refreshing glass of grape juice into his mouth could still be seen.
1	The features like not enough water not enough sense of direction, effect the cyclist because he needs water to keep on peadiling. He needs maps to know what direction and where he is going. From not enough water he said “I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean, leaving only some expensive outdoor gear and a lost entry in place of old men, their wisdom, and there been sense of direction. I made a mental note to change that pargraph” That site ment that the old man’s sense of directin was out of date. They did not no where any thing was at just there in giant poarch.
2	The features of the setting is that it is hot and dry. The way that it affects the cyclist is that he gets very hot and he drinks almost all of his water and he only has about @NUM1 sips left when he gets to the other town. It also effects him because he had an advantage. The advantage that he had was he left before the sun came up. So then he had a time to get cool. Another part of the setting that affects the cyclist is when he gets even some of the hills he gets a little bit of the wind. Also when the cyclist was thirsty he put pebbles into his mouth.
2	Setting plays a crucial part in the cyclist’s mood and energy. For example, in a cool @DATE1 day riding gently downhill, the rider is happy and energetic. However, “traveling through the high deserts of California in June is not the best environment for laughs and ease. The cyclist in the story was hot exhausted, and hydrated. He thought, “I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean.” Where the cyclist rides can have a huge effect on the cyclist himself.
1	The cyclist was riding his bike and was trying to get to rosemite and he had lack of water but he went on any way and he had to go past a snake and got scared.
1	All the features of the settings affect his rythm, determination and will to win because it sets him off his goal a little bit when he should just try to ignore stuff the best as he can. Instead of thinking about it. If I was him I would just ride my bike &amp; think about I thing winning!
10	Did you know that more and more people these days are depending on computers for their safety, natural education, and their social life? In my opinion, the increasing use of computers is not benefiting society. Initially, ones safety while using a computer is at risk. To begin, when someone is talking to another on a computer, they @MONTH1 never know who is at the other end of it. For example, @CAPS1 a small girl was playing a game on the computer and a person began talking to her, it could be a predator. She will never know unless they meet us somewhere. At this point, it maybe too late. Moreover, studies show that @PERCENT1 of people's information is more widely exposed in the last @NUM1 years due to the new chat websites. Such as myspace and facebook. In these websites, people share their information. With this, their safety is at risk. Finally, people should stop using computers as much as they are now, in order to keep their safety safe. Furthermore, enjoying nature is a must, in our world full of immense landscapes, wide waters, dense forests, and lush valleys. @CAPS1 you depend on your computer to teach you about the world, you should cease this use. One must actually be outside, experiencing the feel, the smell, and even the taste of nature. A recent study shows that people who actually went to the grand canyon could write a @NUM1 page essay on what they had learned. The people who didn't go and simply read information off their computer, could not write this much. Finally, society needs to back away from their computers, and stop into. Thirdly, a person's social life could be ruined from the use of computers for many reasons. One reasons for this could be that a person spends all their time on their computer instead of spending time with their family and friends. Sure, you can chat with people online, but that's nothing like chatting in person. There is no need to talk to a friend or family member online, when you could do it in person. Finally, @CAPS1 someone takes an embarrasing picture of you and puts it on their computer, it is there forever. Thus, you can lose friends, whether you're the person in the picture or the addict who put the picture on. With this, you can easily ruin your family/social life by using your computer too often. How would you feel @CAPS1 it was your fault that someone's safety is at risk? Wouldn't you rather enjoy nature in person instead of which it on your computer and not get the fall effect? Couldn't you talk to your friends and family in person rather than ignore them to use your computer? There are numerous ways in which the increasing rate of computer use does not benefit society. I encourage you to agree with me that computers can put one safety at risk decrease their education of nature and ruin their social life.
12	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, @CAPS3 life without computers. There would be no quick access to information, no way to socialize, and no way to keep your health records or other personal information safe. Without this technology where would we be? I believe that the world is benefiting from the advances in technology today. As a student, computers are a crucial element to allow me to get my work done. without the guidance from @ORGANIZATION2 @CAPS7, @CAPS4 @CAPS5, or other applications, @CAPS6 woudn't be possible for me to reach my full potential a assignments. How could a student be so certain their grammar is perfect on their homework without asking a teacher? There is a way. It is called @ORGANIZATION2 tools. However, the only way to access this is through a computer or @ORGANIZATION2 @CAPS7 @ORGANIZATION2 tools allows you to check your spelling, grammar, and punctuation with just a click of your mouse. Computers are an essential learning tool for school system today. Not only are computers used to educate, but they are helpful in the real world. Many business rely on the work of Computers entirely. In facts, @CAPS8 to @PERSON1 @CAPS9 @ORGANIZATION1, a local business &quot;@LOCATION1,&quot; In our job, we continuously we work with. this wouldn't be possible without the effort of our typist on the computer. &quot;@CAPS6 business and companies around the nation are relying on the advances in technology, why change anything? We should continue to progress in this groth @PERCENT1 of business in @LOCATION1 say they would have to close dawn @CAPS6 not for computers with so many business doing this, our economy would drop. This would not help. We all know computers and other technology are great sources of entertainments. What you @MONTH1 not now, however, is that they supply a great amount of knowledge to the average person. For example, lets say you finished watching a special on the discovery channel about @LOCATION2. You want to know more, so you pull out your iPod touch. All you have to do is log on to the internet and search &quot;@CAPS11 of @LOCATION3, @LOCATION2&quot; @CAPS12 seconds, you would have your information. People @MONTH1 not believe so, but it is true that you canlearn a great deal of information from various forms of technology. You can have all the resources you'll ever reed right at your fingertips. Computer supply so much more then just entertainment. All reasonable people would agree advances in technology are extremely helpul to the public. there is so much guidance for our daily lines through computers.
8	Dear Newspaper; I bileve that computers are good for our society. There are maney resons as to why I beleve this. One reson is that it makes life easior, it also helps us understand what is going on in our lives today. If we didn't have computers how would we talk with people without phones and spred news. Computers make life easior by maney ways. For example, if you needed a docters permition to play a sport, it would be alot easior to send him/her an email telling him/her to send you can email saying you can you can show it to the sports team and they will alow you to play. We can also lirn things about our world today by using the computer. We can go on the internet and go to a news website and look at the wether so we can make plans for the day. We can find the newest technology &quot;I phone&quot; or &quot;@CAPS1 &quot;. There are some people in the world that don't but have a computer. For example, my uncle is in the airfore and the only way we can get to talk to him is through the computer because they don't alow phones. Also if there is a pirson with good news and they want tell a lot of people send an email and forward it to everyone. I hope you understand why I beleve computers are a good thing to have in new society. I have that they make life easyor. It also helps us understand our life today and it helps us talk to people around the world. I hope you agree on my topic.
2	To a cyclist, the surrounding setting can either cause triumph or despair. The cyclist was given very old directions. He was given back roads that are abandoned now. These towns had no people in them normally that would not matter, but he “was traveling through the high deserts of California in June.” (@NUM1). If there was shade, a breeze, and @NUM2 weather, he would be fine, but he is pedaling a bike in a desert during the summer. A “ghost town” with no good water could have killed him. A cyclist needs to know their surroundings and be prepared for what nature throws at them.
2	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many different ways. First of all I think that when the cyclist came across the “ghost town” he felt alone and discouraged. I think he felt like he was never going to find his way and there was no one there to help him. Also the long hilly highway with nothing but desert on either side basically gave him the discouraging feeling that that road was never going to end and there was no way out of what he had started. I think it made him feel trapped and it was so dry that there was no water in sight and it made him feel so much thirstier than he was. Overall I think that it had really physical and psycoligical effects on him. 
2	In the story “Do not exceed posted speed limit” by Joe Kurmaskie, the cyclist runs into a couple obstacles and they affected him in many ways. In the story the cyclist is riding a bike for miles. “tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me.... in my dehydrated state.” This quote only lists a few of his problems. He had tumbleweed, a snake and he was dehydrated. He had to stick pebbles in his mouth because he heard that they take away your dehydration. All through out the story he ran into many problems or obstacles but overcame them very well.
3	The features of the setting greatly affect the cyclist. Some of these features include:- the heat, dangerous animals, not a lot of civilization, and the terrain. In the essay, each of these features were spoke of and they all affected the cyclist in a negative way. For example, when the cyclist headed from the intense heat, he needed to find a town. The first “town” he found he described as a “ghost town” It took a while to find another town and he had been hitting [his] water bottles pretty regularly and [he] was travelling through the high deserts of California in June so he was getting really dehydrated and ready to collapse. The flat road [being] replaced by short, rolling hills wasn’t helping either. The terrain really affected the ?? he had to exert in order to keep going, along with being dehydrated the cyclist had to deal with dangerous animals. During his journey “a ridiculously large snake blacked the majority of the ?? “which  ?? him it could have ?? The features of the getting definitely affected the cyclist in many ways
2	The features of the setting affected the cyclist in many ways. First, the heat made the cyclist overheated. For instance, the weather was sunny in June. Also, the hills made the cyclist very tired. For example, the cyclist was losing energy and had to keep pushing. Lastly, the setting had no places that could have helped the cyclist. For instance, the cyclist had trouble finding a place with water to drink. In conclusion, the setting affected the biker in a very negative way.
1	Features of the setting affect the cyclist in the way that it is so hot that he is quickly be coming dehydrated. Another feature is that all the building seem to be either abandoned or in despair.
1	The features of the setting strongly affect the cyclist. Now the setting is in the california desert on a hot day in sane wich caueses the cyclist to drink all of his water wich later malice him dehydrated. The barren desert with no landmarks causes the cyclist to become lost wich is the main problem with the cyclist.
2	The setting of this story plays a huge part in the final outcome. The author makes a mention that he is travelling through the high deserts of California in June. This sentence alone tells the reader that it is hot. And not hot by @LOCATION2 standards, where it gets to @NUM1 degrees, maybe, by noon. That means that the day starts at @NUM2. By noon, it's past @NUM3. Also, the author comes to a sign marked &quot;Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit.” @CAPS1 he makes note that he’s only going 12 mph. Before he reaches any sort of civilization, he has already drunken most of his water, his last &quot;tentalizing sips,&quot; This is his main problem, his lack of water. He drank most of it in the beginning of his ride, thinking he’d be okay, but he regretted it later on
1	The features of the setting affects the cyclist in many ways. The cyclist was in the middle of almost nowhere dehydrating. There were no signs for resting areas where you can find water fountans around. The cyclist put pebbles in there mouth to try  forget about being thirsty. Her surroundings were bumpy so she swallowed one. She just kept going and her words were “I was going to die.” First the cyclist was in danger of dehydrating, and end her satisfaction. The cyclist made it alive as she saw Gary and Wilber’s Fish camp. Her setting was very clear until then. The cyclist was then relieved and made it alive.
1	Because he is dehydrated, the setting makes him worse. He’s biking, in California, in @LOCATION2. It’s not and the sun is probably scorching. The heat plus all the biking he’s doing, is making him even more thirsty and tired.
8	@ORGANIZATION2, Technology has developed majorly these past decades. It has helped mankind so much from buildings to new inventions. These is how ever a growing concern about whether it's beneficital or not? People become more lazier because of the many things you could do with it. I think that it benefits us all. We have learned many things from it. The computer shows what man kind is capable of doing. We can learn about many cultures with it. Students use it for studying and making projects look better. I asked @CAPS1 @PERSON3 of @ORGANIZATION1 about the concren. He says that is can expand our knowledge. There is concern about how much paper we lose every year. With computers it makes going green more possible. You can make powerpoints on the computers instead of using so much paper for long essay. We could do tests on computers. I think the future will be based everything on computers. You can email instead of using letters. For example my friend @PERSON2 said her school didn't use paper and uses computers. They saved money and paper because of powerpoints etc. I miss my family over at @LOCATION1. I want to see them. Not just by talking on the phone. I use the computer to talk to them basically have. I asked @NUM1 people if they perfer using computer to talk to there family or use a phone. @NUM2 out of @NUM1 said they perfer computer. I know I'm trying to they are great but they do have there down side. The games are horrible for the computer. People will just play and play all day long. Online for the games make it even more fun thus it make them lazier. There are so many games for the computer it's horrible says @PERSON1 of @ORGANIZATION3. In conclusion, computers will be something that will help us for a long time and it benefits us. Except the fact about the games I agree with that bad side. I hope I have shown you as an independent person my statement was true.
1	The features of the setting affected the cyclist in many was. The cyclist had been riding on the ‘high deserts of California in June.” The cyclist also saw a “ridiculously large snake.” There was also no signs of civilization for miles.” There was no one insight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind.” The cyclist went through many different obsticales travilng, triying to get to Yosemite. I think the settingS affected the cyclist in many ways.
1	Features of the setting affect cyclists greatly. Things like weather, terrain, temperature, altitude can make or break a cyclist. In this essay, the heat and hills on the road challenge the cyclist. He just keeps going through, and eventually he gets to civilization. This lets you know that you can’t mother nature control you.
1	The features of the setting greatly affect the cyclist. The author is getting worn out and is rapidly running out of water. He “was traveling through the high deserts of California in June. This shows how the setting is causing him to become greatly exhausted.
1	The feature of the setting affected the cyclist tremendously. According to the text, the cyclist was confident he would make the eighteen miles until he passed through the flat round, that was replaced by short rolling hills. He said and I quoted “I toiledon” he sounds like it’s hopeless, that he wasn’t going to make it. As you can see the setting does effect the cyclist.
1	The setting of “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” was very hot deserts. On a bike ride there are not many places to stop for food or water. On a bike ride you cant bring a lot of louage with you. Only important materials and a big enough jug of water. An example from the text to show how bad it was out there. “I got down on my hands, and knees, working,the handle of the rusted pump with all my strength. He was so thirst and tired he didn’t know how else to get some water
2	In the setting the young man is faced  by some challenges that make him as an individual a stronger person. For example he was proud of himself he mad himself happy by saying at the end &quot;yes sir! I own a very good map&quot;. He knows that he got through the heat, dry air, snakes, and a low supplie of water to get to where he was determined to be Yosemite.
1	The setting in the story “Do not exceed posted speed limit&quot; affects the cyclist because it’s a dry area in California in June. The cyclist really needs water which is the main thing affecting him besides the fact that he’s lost in a ghost town. Therefore, the lack of water and misleading directions are the main features displayed.
2	The feature of the cyclist was very good “it erodding to who he say in paragraph @NUM1 @CAPS1”. I would describe it as a fun. It also looks this time was one of his bes time. Here are some examples he is happy, competive, and thin is full. I’m going to explain my examples. First, he looks hoppy becaus in the story he said “the morning with strong legs and smile on my face. the phase can to you how hoppy he felt. My second example was competive, he seems like a competive person, bcouse he is very heathy and lead to to take a ride from the bike. My third example is the way he is becasse he soid &quot;As easily as sounding  bond, my trouble, thirst and fears were all behind me the part made me feel.  
2	In the story “Do Not Exceed posted speed Limit” by Joe Kurmaskie, the features of the setting affect the cyclist. We can tell because the author writes “that road was replaced by short, rolling hills” (Kurmaskie @NUM1). This tells us that cyclist is hard to ride on the road. The speed limit is also affect the cyclist. When the the speed limit sign is appear, the character feels “life can feel so cruel” (kurmaskie @NUM1). It tells us that character can not do what he is trying to do. The bad road and speed limit sigh effect the cyclist.
2	In the essay the features of the setting affected the cyclist. In the begginning the setting was at the old man’s place and the cyclist was happy and confident. When he reached the ghost town and was out of water he was upset and frustrated. When he saw the building he was relived but when he found out it was abandoned he was sad. When he finally reached the store he was excited and relived. That is how the setting affected the cyclist during his trip
6	My opinion about the effects of computers is that computers do help you but people should not us the computer to lot because people should exercise, interacting with family and enjoy nature. Exercising is more important than a computers because it will make you health, you will not be sick so much. Interacting with family is more important than a computers because the @MONTH1 help you have friend but not a family's help you when you help and maybe that friend in the computer is maybe not real that is why it is important to interacting with family. And the last thing that is more important than a computers is enjoying nature. It is fun because you are not bored. You be outside, you will not think about the computer because you will be enjoying so much. My opinion is that computers should only be us to see your mail or to learn something you want to find out in the computer.
3	In the story, “Do not exceed posted speed limit”, there are many features of the setting that affect the cyclist. First, in the beginning of the story it says that, “The sun was beginning to beat down”, the temperature was beginning to rise, but it had not really affected the cyclist because he had plenty of water supply. Next the story says, “I was travelling through the high deserts of California in June”, California’s temperature is really high and June is one of the hottest months of the year. The temperature was very high and the cyclist did not have much water left. This was affecting the cyclist because he was tired, hot, and getting dehydrated. Finally, at the end of the story the terrains were changing and there had been more hills and a road that was not as smooth as pavement because it was a dirt road and the hills were making the cyclist have to cycle harder to go past making him very tired. Also the temperature was still very high and he did not have barely any water left. By the end of the ride the setting of roads, temperature and the distance of the ride had made the cyclist exguasted and dehydrated. 
3	In the short story “Rough road ahead .Do not exceed posted speed limit ,” The cyclist faced many difficulties .These difficulties were the result of the setting .The story takes place in “the high deserts of California in June “ .Because the month June is very warm , and the climate of California is usually hot and dry ,the cyclist ran into problems .Not only did this affect the cyclist , but he travelling through the desert .The setting also included several abandoned towns along the way , which contributed to the problem .The cyclistsoon ran out of water , and discovered the towns that lay before him were unoccupied .He had no choice but to continue with his the journey .
2	The features of the setting effect the cyclist is many different ways. One way is the hilly terrain makes him work harder and wears him out. Since the cyclist is getting worn out he needs to drink more and more water. Now that he’s drinking more water his running out of it faster and wanting more and more of it. Then when he starts to use less water to conserve it until he gets to the next town he starts to become dehydrated and more tired and he starts to feel weak. Also because the terrain is hilly his legs are working harder to go up the hills and his legs become tired. It also starts to get hotter and he gets thirsty more often. That is how the setting affects the cyclist.
1	In the poem “Do not exceed speed limit” the setting is described as very rough and dry. The man on the bike says he was running low on water. At one point he says “At some point tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridi culously large shake” This makes the setting sound dry and empty with a harmful snake around. this  man also said about a sign which read “Rough road ahead: Do not exceed posted speed limit” this also made it hard for the man to ride. These are the settings that affected the biker in the story.
0	The feature of it is the landscape the characters the plot the end and the begining.     
2	The setting in “Do Not @CAPS1 Posted speed limits” affects the mood of the cyclist in that every time the setting changes the mood of the cyclist changes. In the begining of the story the cyclist is riding through the “cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite.” @CAPS2 this time the cyclist is enjoying his trip and is in a positive mood. As the story goes on “there was no one in sight, not a building, a car, or structure of any land.” At this point in the story the cyclist has exchanged his positive mood for a desperate one as his water begins to run out.
3	The setting in the essay “Rough Road Ahead” makes the bikers travel a very difficult challenge that he has to overcome. When the “flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills,” the biker must use more energy to peddl up the hills. This made it hard on him to overcome his exauhtion of physical endurance. Also, he states that he was “traveling through the high desert of California in June” this weather is very hot and dry, therefor causing him to quickly run low on water. And, because he was in the desert, there was no sign of towns or people or salvation of any type. These conditions made it hard on the biker because he knew if he dropped from dehydration, no one would be around to save him. In conclution, these hard conditions challenged the bike a great deal.
3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. The cyclist was on a very long bike ride to Yosemite National Park. However, on the way there, he had to cross through a desert like terrain. The blistering sun had been beating on his back for many miles. All the heat built up a desire for him to get water. He had been very tired. The terrain had made him drenched in sweat. If it wasn’t so hot, then he wouldn’t of had that much of a hard time. The desert contains a very high temperature, which makes it harder to endure physical activities. Even if you are to have a high endurance. The heat will make you very tired, and you will lose a lot of energy. Also, it didn’t help anything, that the elderly men, had gave him terrible directions. That is why I think the setting affected the cyclist.
3	The setting in the story “Do not exceed posted speed limit” affect the author in a big way. The features of the setting are that “there was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind.” The fact that there was nothing around him, made the author lose hope and trust. After the author saw the old juice factory, he felt like something was happening in his favor. Then he saw that it was abandoned and he lost all hope. He shows his loss of hope again when he talks about how he’s going to die. He shows that he’s lost trust in the old men when he talks about never accepting advice from “old-timers who haven’t left their porches since Carter was in office.” In conclusion, the features of the directions he was given and lose any hope of surviving.
2	At the beginning of the ride, the cyclist is feeling good and strong and the day as well as the journey, is just beginning. The sun begins to beat down on the cyclist but he remains upbeat, still feeling good and barely noticing the heat. When he arrives at an old rusty water pump, he feels disappointed and tastes a liquid that resembles “battery acid.” The terrain begins to feel like more of a hill, which makes the struggle even worse. The cyclist is drinking water more now, and is becoming tired. He comesto a rough road and says, “sometimes life can feel so cruel,” which lets the reader know he is feeling the negative affects of what he presumed to be a nice bike ride, a snake blocks his path and he becomes dehydrated. The cyclist feels refreshment and relief at a sign for a fish camp, and his thirst is replenished when he takes a satisfying gulp of water in the restroom. The water is a feature @NUM1 the setting that refreshes the cyclist, while the hot sun, rough terrain, and unknown area are features that make the cyclist feel lost and tired.
8	Dear local Newspaper I believe that computers are a great help to society I will explain my thoughts and ideas to you. I hope you agree with me after reading this. For starters, I would like to say that my first subject is communication, computers allow us to talk to everyday folks or folks that are around the world! There are many ways to talk, text, speech, and webcam, and it is not like you cannot talk to them there are hundreds of communication cients, servers online @NUM1 usually, so you will always be able to someone! Secondly, I would like to say computers have a great way of creation. On a computer you can program @CAPS3, design presentations, documents, drawings, maps, graphs, almost anything you put you mind to can be virtually made. You can gather information from servers websites, @CAPS1, @CAPS2 @CAPS3 you can create and learn a lot on your everyday computer. I am not fisned! There are @CAPS4, @CAPS5, @CAPS6, reading, book sites all on the web! This gives the opprotunity of the &quot;web searcher&quot; to have a vast ammount of information! and allow he or she to learn alot more in every day life. Finaly, I would like to say that computers has a wide range of entertennent! There are many to choose from like videos, movies, @CAPS18, @CAPS1, games anything that is suitable for the user or users of the computer. On a game a user @MONTH1 talk to friends, while @CAPS14 a game such as a (@CAPS8 @CAPS9) for example @CAPS10 @CAPS11 @CAPS12 online, @CAPS13 @CAPS14 game. These kinds of games skyrocket entertennent lovers for the vast ammount of enjoyment they can endure while @CAPS14 a @CAPS8 @CAPS9. Another type of entertennent is videos people can watch videos and movies on a video and more website which has a database of not thousands but millions of videos and movies. Whatever the user wants is a text and a click away! The last type of entertennent is @CAPS1 and @CAPS18, these allow the user to daily life or take to friends, family or relatives. To sum this all up I would like to tell you Local news paper that you should agree that computers are a good thing for the society! Please reread and pick the right @CAPS2!
1	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. For example the sand and the intense heat are two big parts of the setting, which make him thirsty. “... followed by brakish water feeling somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees”. This is a quote that explains the intense heat that the cyclist is feeling. The sun is another big feature that affects him. This is how the setting affects the cylist.
1	The feature effect the cyclist because he wants to go somewhere spectaculiar and amazing like. Like for example, he said he was thriving on this one spot forever and he finally got their and it was a ghost town and he chuckeled and roud away because it wasn’t what he was looking for. I belive that this guy in judging every place he goes by the way it looks and not by what it haves to offer like he doesn't believe in getting direction from an old mat, but yet he still took it. I believe that he wants to get were he wants to go and not let anybody get in his way no matter what it's like he is looking for a perfect spot and he think want he finds it he will be filled with story.
2	The setting can affect a cyclist in many ways, if it were hot out, he would be thirsty and sweaty. If there were hills the cyclist would be tired as well as thirsty. The cyclist although thirsty and tired is determined to get through and find a town. The cyclist said” I began breaking the ride down into distances I could see on the horizon, telling myself that if I could make it that far, I’d be fine,” By saying this, he knows that he can make it that far as well as determined to do so. With the terrain causing even more trouble for him, would make it more difficult, but he knows that he must overcome his challenging activity but he still keeps a strong spirit with that, he can do just about anything because he has the encouragement he needs.
3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist by making his mood change. In the @LOCATION1, where it’s nice, shaded, and cool, he feels fairly good. He’s excited and ready to take on the adventure of a new path. His still in a good mood when he comes to the first town. As he moves on, and his water supply deplets, his mood sinks lower and he becomes more frustrated. In the ironic twist of fate that he finds a Welch’s Grape Juice, Factory, he is about to quit. He is dejected and almost ready to admit defeat. But he forces himself to go on, and when he finally reaches a place with water, his relief is mixed with wariness of the old man sitting on the porch. He will never take after for granted or advice from old men ever again.
3	The features of the setting only drain the cyclist's willpower. The things he sees discourage him, for example one ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps and a corral that couldn’t hold the larnest, mule greeted me. This sight was troubling .” The desolation begins to wear away his hope of finding a building or town sometimes the things are psychologically damaging,” In an ironic twist that should please all sadists reading this, the building abandoned years earlier, by the looks of it – had been a Welch’s Grape Juice factory and bottling plant. A sand blasted picture of a young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice into his mouth could still be seen.” For someone who is quickly running out of water, this this irony could make one lose their resolve to continue. The snake and rolling hills slow him down, and make him use more energy. The heat dehydrates the cyclist even faster. The environment is a hostile one for a cyclist.    
2	The features of the setting affected the cyclist in many ways. First the climate affected him the most thats so because he became to hot, drank a lot, and then became dehydrated. So he had no energy because of dehydration. Another one is the built of the road. That’s so because it was rocky bumpy, winding, hills with being dehydrated the road was very tempting to just give up and die. Then the heat got him because there was no shade, no water left, and the sun just beating down on him.
3	During the cyclist trail there are many factors that play out to be disadvantages to him/her. There are rough roads, bad water pump, abandoned battling plant, and the long lasting truth that it wasn’t even his path. All of these factors create something new in the cyclist. As the cyclist recover the first town and realizes it is decreased he is initially amused. He then pedals on, but realizes his water is running low. Then , what is originally a sign of hope because another let down. A water pump found just in time, but the water is no longer any determination they reach “rough roads” creating, once again, a more painful journey. Finally, the cyclist sees a building in the distance, but again, deserted. The only goodness as the poor cyclist is when they came along a bait “tar, some sign of civilization that keeps him alive. Hope after hope arises to the end in turmoil upon turmoil. These encounters would cause oneself to become persimistic on even a task, but he sought through. These encounters create an interesting meal. Every time you catch word on hope you become entitled to what could happen next and then feel sorry for the cyclist after having hope on multiple occasions. The steady and salidrising the plot keeps the reader entitled wanting more.
1	The setting affected the cyclist because of the bad condition roads. The was also hills so they made it harder for the cyclists.
2	“There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind”. This adaodoness makes it hard for the cycleist to frot hope and threes as where to get water. “I could drop from a heat strote in a gorgeous day in June, hes in the desert in @LOCATION1 in June with little water around no one this make's him very desperate since hes adaodoned.
1	The main features that affected the cyclist were the ruff terrain and the hot sun. The rough terrain made it harder to pedal and it tired the cyclist out faster. But also helping was the hot sun because it would dehydrate him while he was riding. So between the hard to pedal rough terrain and the dehydratiog hot sun, the cyclist was very affect to the point of exausition.
7	Dear @CAPS1, I thick this is a good idea because you can play games and talk to family or frends and lisen to music. My first reason is playing games. When you are bored and theres nothing to do all you can do is go on the computer and play all kinds of games like cars, shoting, arcade games to. You can do all this if you are bored or if you just want to go on the computer. My seacond reason is talking to freinds or famiely. If your brother or sister or any of your family members live in a different state and you want to talk to them or see them then all you got to do is ask them &quot;@CAPS2 is your email address and then if they got a myspace or facebook then you could talk to them as long as you want. You can also talk to your friends on those websites to. My thied reason is lisening to music. You can also lison music on your computer bu going to @CAPS3 or downloading frostwire or something like that. You can lison to all kinds of music like hip-hop, rap rock, or havey rock. If you want to lison to any song your going to need the song's name and something the artistes name to. This @CAPS2 I thinck they should put and @CAPS2 they should pick.
3	The features of the setting in the essay, “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted speed limit” affect the cyclist. As the cyclist rides to his destination, he encounters obstacles and views his surroundings. The author gives the starting setting in the second paragraph as “a reservoir campground outside of lodi, California an early. Summer evening.” The reader is informed that the temperatures are not in summers in California. This gives the cyclist his main conflict, the lack of water. With temperatures being high, it is easier to become quickly dehydrated. The author stated, “The sun was beginning to beat down and I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June. Also, to cyclist encounters a ridiculously large” snake in the middle of the rode. The reader is aware that there are many conflicts which one can encounter while cycling. There are finally many features of the setting that let the cyclist know where he currently is, and the place where he wants to be most, the cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite.” @CAPS1 the essay, the cyclist is determined to reach Yosemite, and although he faces troubles, he doesn’t give up and is relieved when he finally receives water.
2	The features of the desert changed the way the speaker thought about his journey. When the road began the change, the speaker’s determination did too, “Flat road were replaced by short hills”. The terrain began to change and the speaker became doubtful of the old man that that directed him towards the shortcut. “I could drop from heat stroke on a gorgeous day in June simply because I listned to some gentlemen who hadn’t been off their porch in decades”. The heat in desert made the speaker thirsty causing him to drink all his water. There was no source of water therefore he decided to suckenc-stone. “I’d read once that sucking on stones helps take your mind off thirst”,. But the bumpy terrain didn’t allow him to do that. He hit a bump and swallowed the stone. The speaker began to panice, “I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean”. But luckily the author thoughts changed after he found a supply of water, the features did affect the cyclist very much.
2	The setting affects the cyclist in a very negative way due to the lack of buildings, people, and cars on his “shortcut” he was in great doubt of his survival. “I was going to die, and the birds would pick me clean.” He thought he wouldn’t get any water because there was nothing around him and he thought he would die of dehydration or heatstroke. “And the growing realization that I would die of heatstroke.”
2	The setting of the story had affected the bike rider in many way. It was hot when he was riding so he was thirsty. For example, “The sun was beginning to heat down” (pg @NUM1). So the sun is very exhusting and made him to start dehydrating. Another example is a traveling through the desert of California in June” (pg @NUM2). California is a relatively hot state and June is one of it’s warmer months. The terrain didn’t favor in the riders either “Flat road had turned into, short rolling hills “(pg @NUM2). Short rolling hills are harder on a bikers body than flat terrain. This is how the setting affected the rider.
1	The setting affected the cyclist because it was in June and it was starting to get hot. In the book, it said he was going through the desert. Also, the author did not have enough water to survive in the desert while the sun was beaming on him.
1	In this paragraph I will explain how the features of the setting affect the cyclist. The setting affect the cyclist in ways such as weather, road structure, &amp; animals. All things that the cyclist could not controll. Therefor affecting the cyclist while he rides through.
1	The features of the setting in this story gives the cyclist determination. Since the desert
2	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because if is very hot and is summertime. The cyclist wouldn’t have gotten so tired and exhausted if he wasn’t in a “ghost town”, with the, “sun beggining to beat down”. It was in @CAPS1 for nia during June so it was. Very hot, the water was also @NUM1 degrees! The text as states there were rolling hills and tumble weeds, so it must have been a desert kind of area. The trip was also a very long one, “about forty miles into the petal”, causing him to be tired. As you can see the setting was an area with no people, and it was very hot.
1	The features of the setting is very important for cyclist. If the setting is wrong they could be in many danger. It is really important to have a clear setting.
2	The features of the setting affected the cyclist horribly! For example, he ran into the worse problems and couldnt really do anything about them. also, he started out fine, then he started to become dehydrated. He didnt have much water left and he was only @NUM1 miles up the road. a loss of water was very affective in June traveling through a desert. also, the damage of the road was very affective too because hes on a bike and not too good of balance. These features could affect the cyclist in many ways because of the weather, temperature, loss of water, road damages and snakes. the cyclist was on a bike and couldnt really protect himself, and he was dehydrated, and tired. 
8	What is more fun, stairing at a blank computer screen all day, or spending the day out in beutifull nature with your friends and family? Well, if you don't know, I do. I took a survey at my school with the same exact question and @PERCENT2 of the kids said that hanging out with friends and family is much more than spending all of your time on the computer, and there are three reasons why they said that. First, instead of talking to people on the computer, than in person. Next it's unhealthy, and lastly alot of bad things can happen on the internet. So, if you are interested in this topic please keep on reading and I will prove that the computer is not a good way to spend your spair time. Do you know what computers were intended to do? Computers were you people, but have for one second that instead of interacting with people you should interact with the people around you. Instead of going on facebook/myspace to talk to your friends, just them over. If you do that its not only more fun, healthier for you. So next time anything else just think the other options. In my last paragraph didnt I say that hanging out with friends is much more healthier then being? Well I was absolutly @PERCENT1! Did you know that when you waist your only hurting yourself? Well, you are when all your doing is sitting down stairing at a screen you are not doing anything to help your self because you are get absolutly exercise. When your not on the computer at least walking a little bit, but typeing doesnt do anything for you. Thats why people shouldn't spend all of their time on the computer. Have you ever heard of an internet preditor? Well if you let me just sum it up for you. An internet preditor is someone that uses the computer to get people they dont know do inapropriate things. And did I say it was against the law, because it is. So if you you ignore friend because if you dont, bad things. And tahts just one of the reasons why people spend as much time on the computer. So, now you know why people shouldnt spend as much time on the computer as they usually do. First, instead of talking to people on the computer, go in person. Next, it's unhealthy, and lastly, internet preditors. So the next time you open your laptop, just think is it more fun stairing at a blank computer screen or spending the day in beutifall nature with friends and family? And always remember what the is.
3	Throughout his journey, the protagonist in the story encounters obstacles in the setting. First off, he is cycling in the hot, dry, desert. There is no civilization or natural water source, so he faces dehydration. Additionally, the terrain he was riding on proved difficult. He encountered rolling hills that took a lot of energy to ride up. There were even signs for “rough road ahead,” @CAPS1 obstacle was a mental obstacle. He came across an abandoned juice factory when he needed an occupied building. These were ironic and mentally frustating. The cyclist must have lost hope in @CAPS2 civilization after he found @NUM1 abandoned examples of civilization. This discouragement must have made his journey more mentally challenging.
1	The features in the setting would affect the cyclist because they would want to have towns with water so they can restock they’re water. They would want water even more after going up hills. They would also want a palce to gey something to eat and maybe rest.
1	The feature of the setting affects the cyclist because of the heat and had know water. Also how rough the road ahead was. Another problem was the dry air and snakes laying out everywhere in the desert. Also the hills were a big problem to because of the heat and know water. Finally the other problem was he knew he was going to die and the birds would eat at him and their would be nothing left of him. This is how the setting affected the cyclist.
3	The hot, dry, desert setting affects the cyclist in many different ways, “I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June” (@NUM1). The cyclist is very hot. He was thirsty but, “A tarlike substance ooted out, followed by brakish water feeling somewhere in the neighborhood of zoo (@NUM2). The water was barely even water, so he didn’t have much to drink until the next town. “Flat road was replaced by short, rolling  hills” (@NUM3). Flat road is much easier to bike on then hills. He was thirstier and more tired after biking on hills “A sandblasted picture of a young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice in his mouth could still be seen” (@NUM4) on an old welchs grape fruit factory. This makes the cyclist envicus of the young boy. It also discourages him. In conclusion, the water being bad, the terrain change. the picture of the young boy, and the fact that the cyclist drinks a lot makes him tired, hot, envious, and generally exausted.
3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because when he has water and plenty of it, the setting seems to be smooth, easy riding. This means that he doesn’t have to use much water, but he still uses some because anyone that rides @NUM1 miles on a bike will need plenty of water no matter what the terrain is like. The features of the setting affect the cyclist toward the middle and end of his trip greatly because it gets rough and hilly and so he needs more water that he doesn’t have. And since he was planning on being able to get water at the first stop he didn’t conserve it as well, so this left less water for him to have when he really needed it. He then became dehydrated after his first stop, and he didn’t get any more water there so it caused him to dehydrate. So it seem that the features of the setting affect the cyclist because when he has plenty of water and doesn’t really need it the terrain is smooth and easy to ride but as he drinks his water the terrain gets rougher and worse. So the features of the setting affects him greatly in that they don’t help him they just get worse when he needs it to get better.
1	There are many ways that the features affect the cyclist. One is that he is already scared to go up this really big hill. Another is that he is going up this big hill its hot, there snakes, hes scared and tired. Almost all of his energy is gone. He just wants to stop he is determined to go up this hill. He also knows that it cant be that bad because he can just relax al the way back down.
3	After reading, Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Speed Limit,” I noticed that the setting of this adventure affected the narrator. First of all, the heat cause the narrator to be uncomfortable and thirstier. While on the moving, he refers to the trip as a ,”water-deplating” one this quote shows that he was lacking water and that this was a major problem. Also it refers to the road as “rolling hills&quot;, and this shows the reader that they seem to go on forever. This lowers the narrator’s hope of getting there quickly. Also the desert gives the author low hope of reaching his destination. The setting affects the narrator both physically and mentally.
2	The setting of the story affected the cyclist because it kept him going because he was all alone and had no help. First, just the fact that he was by himself kept his determination high. If he would have had a partner they could have stopped and took a break or shared the water. Next, the fact that there were no buildings, houses or anything in sight affected him.  He got a bolt of strength just from seeing a building ahead. If there had been building he could have stopped and asked for more water and rested. The fact that he was in a desert in California in the middle of June really affected him. He had no determination there because there was nothing he could do to better the situation in his cause. He even at one point felt that he might die. In conclusion the setting really affected the cyclist because it determined his endurance and will power.
1	Features of the setting affected the cyclist in many different ways.for example, he ask the older guts, &quot;that haven't left rheir porches since carter was in the office where the next placewas to get water. Also he was out in the middle of nowhere. It was also in June were the weather was warm,and he didn't have a lot of water.
3	Many features of the setting affect the cyclist. First, he was in “high desert of California in June.” This affected him many ways. It makes him become very dehydrated. He had to conserve his water and chew on pebbles to get any spit to collect in his mouth. Also, the road became very rough. The new terrain made him has to push himself harder and lose energy quicker. The last feature would be the distance. He had to travel a lot further then he had planned to. This again affected his energy and spirits with thoughts of possible death, and not be able to make it. Those are how just some of the features of the setting affected the cyclist.
10	Computers have a positive effect on people. Computers can help people learn about news in the world, places and people. Computers can also help people communicate with each other. Computers can also teach hand-eye cordination. People who support advances in technology, believe computers have a positive effect on people. Without computers people could not learn new things. On a computer you can learn about new places. People could see where something is, locate it, or learn about the place. I remember when I was working on a project about @LOCATION2. I had no clue what to do on the topic, so I whent on the computer and looked up @LOCATION2. It told me @LOCATION2 was located in @LOCATION1. Then it showed me a picture of @LOCATION2, and the history of the country. Without the computer I would not have been able to learn about this fasinating country. On a computer you can also learn about historic and famous people. On computers you can read biographies of them, or watch videos of whay they did to become famous. People used to read news out of a newspaper, on computers you can too without paying the cost of buying a newspaper. Computers can also give you a live feed of what is happening in the world. Without computers people could not learn. On computers you can also communicate with people that are very far away. Scientist did a study on how people communicate. @PERCENT1 of @CAPS1 said they used a computer to comunicate with other people. People can use a webcam, aim, or email to communicate with other people. To communicate with my family in @LOCATION2 I use a webcam. To communicate with my friends I use email or aim. Writing letters is to slow, on computer the other person your talking to can reply immediately. On a computer communication is made easier. A computer can also teach you hand-eye cordination. On a computer you see something on the monitor and you can click it without looking down at the mouse to click. This can help you in sports and give you fast reflexes. In many sports you need hand-eye cordination. For example, in basketball you need to look up while you dribbling or you while fall. Computer can give people fast reflexes and helps people in sports. Computer should be part of societys everyday life. Computer have a positive effect of people and they can help people learn new things, like, places, people, and news in the world. Computers are very benefital to society.
1	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. Since the cyclist was in the middle of no where, he couldn’t get any water. “I’d read once that sucking on stones helps take your mind off thirst,” he was so thirsty that he barely had any energy to keep going, “The growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke,” it was hot out and he had no water so this affected his energy.
2	The features of setting affect the cyclist. The harsh turane proved a challenge when his water supply was low and all towns had been abandoned leaving him no refill. The heat was also a factor quickly creating him weary and tired. On the bike ride he had a glimmer of hope at an old water pump but quickly disappointed when the hot liquid tasted of battery acid. The setting set the conflict and helped achive the tone the author was looking for to affect the cyclist.
1	The settings effect the cyclist by the roughness of the ride. First, they go over a bunch of rocks, and the tire could poys. Next it could be smooth and easy. Also, it could be far away from towns and difficult to get back. There could be a lack of water making you dehydrate. That is how the setting around the cyclist could effect him.
2	The setting desented in the story, “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Speed Limit,” would be a nightmare for any biker. This biker is riding in the middle of a desert on a summer’s day. The sweat dropping down him is just speeding up his dehydration. This is shown when the narration states, “wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that i could drop from heatstroke” (Kurmaskie). This show how hot the desert was, and how he could drop dead. The desert is also deserted with rolling tumbleweeds and giant snakes, as he passed abandoned towns and factories. The dangerousness for a biker in this area is very high. The biker was lucky to have made it out of those sorroundings alive.
1	The desert area of California was makeing him dehydrated. The trip was long but he had enough water to get him there only if he took the maps way. The old men thot “haven’t left the confines of their porches since carter was in office” told him a shortcut that he followed and ended up almost killing him due to heat stroke and dehydration. If the cyclist would have followed the map he could have stoped off at a store for more water if the setting was that bad.
3	The features of the setting  affect the cyclist in many ways. The setting was a dry California desert, for if it had been a busting city, the events in the story would have not happened. The author asked a group of old men for directions to Yosemite National Park, and , “like a foolish yuuth,” folluwed their advice. Everything started out fine until he reached the second town. He –ans almost dehydrated and “in an ironic twist” he reached on abandoned grape juice foctary. Almost all hope was lost for him until he rounded the bend and came across his new hope: “Gary and Wilber’s Fish camp-if you wont bait pur the big ones, we’re your best bet “ in He end he learned tostick to a map instead of old people who “haven’t left the confines of their purchess,hce carter was ,h office”
2	The features of the setting affected the cyclist because first he realized that getting advise from people that no longer drive or even leave of the porch would be unuseful. When the author say “old timers who haven’t lest the confined of them porches since carter was in office” that what he is explaining. He then say “I rode  into the morning with strong legs and a smile on my face” he was refering back to how hes  on the rode  alone riding the bike and theres not a car insight any where around. The curbs of the turns where so sharp that only a bicycle could make them as safe as he did “He whipped the sweat from his eyes to make sure it wasn’t mirage and tried not get to excited” @CAPS1 in this situation would have made many people excited about the long lonely cicle by his self.
1	The features of the setting affected the cyclist by making his way to the Yosemite National Park a longer and more difficult and dangerous way to go. He takes the awee of going that way by some old folks that he says “haven’t gotten off there porches since carter was in office.” I think tha tthere would be a reason to not listen to them though they @MONTH1 have wisdom.
2	In the setting there are no cars and no buildings meaning no help. The cyclist is tired and dehydrated because he ran out of water. No one was around because it was the desert. The cyclist was dehydrated but kept going to his destination. The road was straight but almost to the end there were many hills. Along with having to bike up the hills he almost ran into a snake. The weather was hot he had no water, he could have died.
2	The features in the setting in the story “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” greatly affect the biker. For example, the heat is constantly drying the biker out. Also, at the first town the old water pump proved to be a hopeless cause with water tastd like “battery acid”. Even after that were more problems. There was a sign that posted a max speed limit. The biker was doing about one-fifth of that speed. This affects his mood and he realizes that it will be along ride. The pebbles that he found helps him out. He remembers reading that sticking pebbles in your mouth calms your thirst. Finally, the bait store gave him the relief that he needed at the end of his trip. In conclusion, the setting makes the riders journey an  one, but in the end the bait store had just what he needed.
8	Dear Local Newspaper, I'm writing to you because I believe that people in the @LOCATION1 over use computers these days. I think that instead of home on your lazy and playing farmville and pets on facebook you should get out more. I think that you should @CAPS8 the gym and work out you should @CAPS8 out to the park or have family fun night with your kids (@CAPS1 you have any) The last thing I think you should @CAPS7 is @CAPS8 have a little &quot;@CAPS2&quot; time for example take your self somewere nice (you'll about time in a second) @DATE1 all you've done is sit home playing farmville and other games and what not you probably get really fastly and you eating right? well @CAPS1 @CAPS3.... boy you gained some pounds of the @DATE1 and you look you need to get your self to a gym. from sitting on your while on the @CAPS9 every day you any calories or fat @CAPS3 when you eat all your doing is gaining weight. and @CAPS4 you probably don't want to. @CAPS7 you have a family? Well @CAPS1 you @CAPS7 I think that taking a family trip to the park would be fun or going to @ORGANIZATION1 would be a fun way @CAPS3 you can get your hands off those keys and your head with your kids. Also you should make other nightfamily fun night and play games and hang out with family on family fun night you can play characles or a board game. (as long as you don't have a in your house) The last my favorite one is &quot;@CAPS4&quot; Time. During &quot;@CAPS4&quot; Time you can take your self shopping out to lunch/dinner you even take a map the whole point of &quot;@CAPS4&quot; Time is that You @CAPS7 NOT @CAPS8 ON THE @CAPS9!! you need to relax and just take a brake. Well those are my suggestions to you. @CAPS3 now its your turn to jump on out of virtual world and put your head back in reality.
1	The features of the setting affected the cyclist. For example their was not towns close near. One reason this affected the cyclist is because if the towns were near each other if he ran out of water there would be stores close by. In addition he could have a heatstroke and there would be no one around to get help from and he could easily die. In my point of view of the reading I believe where he was located is what affected him mostly.
1	The hot wheather is dehydrating the cyclist, who can’t find more water. The hills are rough terrain is draining the energy he has. The heat is so rough he has to break the road down it to polants he wants to get to. He get drained physically and emotionally. He has a hard journey.
2	The features of the setting affect the cyclist on how the nature of life he was hydrated or not. On the posts “Do not exceed posted speed limit “is after “wide rings of dried sweat clinched my thirst, and the growing realization that I could drop from heat stroke on a gorgeous day in June”. This shows that he is dehydrated from the sun which is a feature of the setting. “a tarlike distance surged out, followed by cockish water feeling somelane in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees.” Cyclist know that there is no water in this place which is another feature of the setting which affects the cyclist.  
2	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. The cyclist from the essay “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit, “by Joe Kurmaskie had many obsticales to over come. When he first showed the old men his map he was probably thinking to himself, “@CAPS1 my gosh, what did I get myself into?!” Because the cyclist trusted the shortcut the old men told him about he had a lot of doubt, anger and determination later on during the day. It was really hot and he was running out of water making him worried he was going to get dehydrated and die because he was starting to think he was getting lost. The hills also affected the cyclist by making him tired. In conclusion, the cyclist, in the end, found a little store by all the determination and effort he put in.
1	The setting where the cyclist is at is in a desert, and it can affect him because, he could get a heatstroke. The text states that he is lacking water and if you get too dehygrated it's not healthy and you die from it. However, when the wind is against his face, it can cool him down,along with the sweat. As long as he has some lijid left, it should be ohang. 
3	The setting of this story is a dry, hot desert in the middle of June. These features of the setting, effect the author, because it shows how he starts of strong + determained and his left weak + doubtful. In the begining of the story, the author says, “Things began well enough. I rode into the morning with strong legs and a smile on my face.” This is showing the readers confidence he has with himself before starting his trip. Later on in the story, he discribes the setting as “the high deserts of California in June.” He is discribing the heat + what he is facing. It goes on to tell how he is dehydrated in worn out. But he comes to a town, &quot;cool water drippen from my head as I slumped against the wall.&quot; @CAPS1 he is relieved. As the setting changes, the authors attitude changes as well.
2	Different features of the setting affect a cyclist for example,temperatare really changes everything. If it’s too hot, you’re going to get tired really easily. Then again, if its too cold, breathing gets really hard. The biker in the story was in desert area in june, so it was really hot &amp; tiring. Also, the terrain as affects a clyclist. If the road is filled with hills getting up those hills is difficult. If it’s all down hill, it’s really easy, but all uphill is hard, level terrain is fairly easy. The cyclist in the story was in level terain, then it turned into a lot of hills which tired him out. Features of the setting really affect a cyclist
2	The setting affects the cyclist because he is faced with roadways he is unsure of the weather is hot and dry and there are wild animals. The text states,
1	The setting has a great impact on the condition of the cyclist. First, it is a very hot dry in June. The cyclist is maneuvering his way through “high deserts in @LOCATION1” where he comes across many hills that he must climb over and maneuver his way down. With all of these obstacles and the heat slowing him down he will need water but is already low.
3	In the story “Rough Road Ahead Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit&quot; the narrator is faced with the challenging and perilous desert he must cross. He wasnt traveling in a car, he was riding a bike and crossing a desert on foot is tiring enough let alone on a bike. &quot;The speed limit was @NUM1. I was doing a water depleting @NUM2. Sometimes life can be so cruel.” In the horrible @NUM3 degree heat the narrator gulps down his water bottles at such a rate that he’s at risk of running out. Not only that but he’s been pedaling for such a long time that he @MONTH1 pass out from exaustion or,.” I could drop from heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June simply because I listened to some gentlemen who hadnt been off their porch in decades.” So I would say the narrator was pretty hasseled by his surroundings. 
9	Dear @CAPS1, Computers are an amazing advantage to use in this modern day and age. They are easy to learn how to use, you can connect with old friends, and even learn by going to an online school or college they offer. Computers are amazing advancement and this is why you should use one. Who doesn't like computers? They are easy to learn how to use and are in a variety of forms. Almost every college student has a computer or laptop. They could have never used one before, but then they learned how easy it was. Most computers come already installed with the necessary programs including: @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS2 @CAPS3, or some form of @CAPS2, a virus protection software, and other simple software. Moving is very hard, you leave a place where you have so many friends to a place that is so new to you. Computers make this so much easier by letting you connect with them without having to wait for the mail by writing letters. There is email, facebook, and myspace that let you chat with old friends, new friends, or even parents. Some people say that these things are dangerous, that is only if you start talking to people you don't know. People keep coming up with even more ways to stay connected so don't miss out on the opportunity. These people are so smart, they figured out a way to have school online. This is very helpful to somebody who is injured or is trying to get another degree to get a better job. People get assignments to do and each class only takes about one or two months. People get to do their job or enjoy nature still because their day is open and not busy. Sure people don't get to enjoy the campus, but with the price of gasoline these days, it's worth it. So don't be the person sitting around doing nothing, buy a computer and stay in touch with technology. Remember computers are easy to use, you can stay connected to friends and you can go to school on them. This technology can help you more than it can hurt you.
2	The setting affected the character in ways that would usually affect people. When he got into the first town he had ran out of water to drink but the towns water he was in now tasted like battery acid so that’s not safe to drink. As he started to head out the scenery changed. “Not two miles into this next section of the ride, I noticed the terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.&quot; This is hinting at the fact that maybe this town he is going to @MONTH1 be abandoned or not used. He saw a huge rattle snake and tumbleweed. Which are usual signs of a desert. It was hard for him to keep his balance as he says, “trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state.” He ended up getting to the point where he had to put rocks in his mouth to trick his mind that he wasnt thirsty anymore.
2	The feature of the setting affected the cyclist because at first he had to watch out for the snakes that usually crossed the roads, then the streets were crooked and bumpy, so the road structure throw him off a bit, and he was riding his bike in June and it was very hot, and he had lack of water so he thought he was going to have a heatstroke. These things affected how the cyclist performed on his bike.
3	The cyclist is riding through the high deserts in California. In this environment everything looks the same for miles. The cyclist is dehydrated and is getting worse because he has no protection from the sun. It is hard for the cyclist to keep in good spirits because he is not even coming across any towns or sources of water. The cyclist says “About forty miles into the pedal, I arrived at the first ‘town.’ This place might have been a thriving little spot at one time- say before the last world war- but on that morning it fit the traditional definition of a ghost town.” This made the cyclist doubt the old timers directions. In the wide open desert, the cyclist was only coming across something after at least twenty miles. The heat, lack of water, and lack of civilization made the cyclist think he was “going to die and the birds would pick [him] clean. When the cyclist spots the abandoned Welch’s factory, the cyclist says they used what seemed to be their last bit of energy. The conditions affected the cyclist
1	The setting affects the cyclist by showing that he is a little angry. He states that “don’t remember the saying don’t take candy from strangers.” So we know he is upset about something. He is mad about the fact that this one older man tells him directions on how to get somewhere, and it’s wrong. The man figure that out halfway through the story. He also said that “the old man hasn’t been off his porch since Carter was in office,” so he needs to get his directions up to date. So the beginning is a negative attitude.
1	In the story “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” the settings affected the character because he thought he wouldn’t make it to the park because of the way things looked around him. Because of the rolling hills and snakes he didn’t think he would make it any where and thought he was going to die. That’s how the setting affected the character.
3	While the cyclist was trying to get to Yosemite National Park he listen to some old  men who gave him directions for a shortcut.When he began his trip everything was fine.But then he found that along the “shortcut” there was no building.By the time he figured out that the old men were mistake he had almost run out of water.There was nothing around that he could drink.He was getting very thirsty.The fact that he was in the deserts of California in June didn’t make his task any easier.About halfway through his ride he ran into rolling hills, which made his trip even harder.Towards the end he found a building and he used all of his strength to get to it just to find that it was an abandoned juice factory.This made going without water much harder as well as he gazed at the picture of the boy who was drinking juice.In the end he finally make it to a pait shop where he guzzled all the water he possibly could
1	The features of the setting affected the cyclist greatly. For example when he was riding on the road he would pick a destination and ride to it. Then he would take a break. If this destination was a building he would be strong willed and determined. If it looked like their was nothing ahead but hills, he would just ride and wait to fall over dead without a care in the world.
3	One ramsackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a corral that couldn’t hold in the lamest mule greeted me. This sight was troubled. There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind. With any luck, I’d hit a bump and lodge one in my throat. Rough road ahead if he didn’t take the old mans advice, he would have enjoyed his bike ride he needed a new map.
2	The features in the story affect the cyclist by not having anything to drink. The person was going to a place far away with out any food or water for miles. He could have died. There is anther feature the effects the cyclist, and that is no one is around for miles. If he died out there, no one would no know for days. I know this because in the story he said “ There was no one in sight, not a building, car or structure of any kind. ''That says it all, the last feature is that it was hot. I know this because it says ''I was travelling through high deserts of California in June.'' It is hot is June, and it is even hotter in California.
1	People who travel will almost always encounter difficulties. For the main character in this story, thus a very true. His first mistake was when he took directions from the “old-timers” by doing that, he travelled extremely far out of his way. In the story he talked to the old men on the porch. He said, “what I shouldn’t have done was to let them see my map&quot;.  Another problem he faced was when he began to run out of water.  This caused a problem to him because of dehydration. In the story he said, “The water bottle contained any a few tantalizing sips.” @CAPS1, another problem he encountered was the desert area that he was riding through. This caused problem for him because there wasn’t anybody around to help him if he needed it. In the story he says, “There was no one in sight, not a building, cars, or structure of any kind.” By reading this story, we’ve realized that people encounter problems everywhere, however any problem, no matter what size, can be overcomed
10	Dear Newspaper, @NUM1 percents of jobs @CAPS9 day use computers. The invention of computers have change our world in a positive way. Our society needs @CAPS1. @CAPS1 help our world @CAPS9 by teaching about faraway places and their cultures, uniting our world with new techniques of talking and helping workers to have a better job. Let's go on. &quot;@CAPS1 is the best electronic tool created by the world&quot; @CAPS5 @PERSON4 a profesor in @ORGANIZATION2. Today the world works by @CAPS1, as @CAPS1 grow! Our culture was loosing territory but as years past cultures and @CAPS1 started to work together. &quot;@CAPS2 you want to know about a culture just go to the internet&quot; @CAPS5 a teache from @CAPS3. Culture is really imporant for our world because is what we were before technologi exist @PERCENT1 of the world culture can be found in the internet or in our computers. @PERCENT2 of people @CAPS2 they need to do a research they don't go the country to do their research instead the first thing they think is the @CAPS1 because they can find what they need at any time. Let's continued. @PERCENT3 of people agree that the invention of computers helped our nations to be closer. @CAPS9 days you can talk through the @CAPS1 with a person in @LOCATION2 without needing to go to @LOCATION2. &quot;The creation of @CAPS1 created a new revolution of way of communicating&quot; @CAPS5 @PERSON1 a young student of @ORGANIZATION2. &quot;@CAPS4 of my internatinal calls I do by using a computess, and there are so many ways of talking, also is so easy.&quot; @CAPS5 a mother of a student in @CAPS3. Computers are use @PERCENT4 more than cell phones because is cheaper, &quot;@CAPS7 true you can see the change of our nation, is the best thing a human created&quot; @CAPS5 the professor at @ORGANIZATION1. Lets go farther on. Did you know that @PERCENT4 of our jobs in the @ORGANIZATION3 is mostly about using a computers. Even engeneers use computers an example is @LOCATION1 @CAPS8. the engeneer. Awarded by the president @PERSON3. He @CAPS5 that &quot;@PERCENT5 of his job is using a @CAPS1. Statistic proved that @CAPS2 you know how to use a @CAPS1 you a higher opurtunity that a wage higher than the avage you would received when you do not know anything about @CAPS1. Another statistic should that @CAPS2 you know and use computers you would live longer and happier. @NUM2 @ORGANIZATION2 student agreed that his friend have better jobs @CAPS2 they know how to use computers. &quot;Computers helped young adults to have a better oportunity in life&quot; @CAPS5 the teacher of @ORGANIZATION4. &quot;@CAPS9 days is esential to know how to use @CAPS1&quot; @CAPS5 @PERSON2 a teacher of @CAPS3. @CAPS1 helped the world to change in better way. Let finished up. @CAPS1 is a tool that @CAPS4 of our nations used. @CAPS1 helped to learn about new cultures of other countries, also the new ways you talk to someone around the world in the conviniant of your house just by using a computers and &quot;the handy @CAPS7 can be to know how to use @CAPS1 when you are applying to a job. @CAPS1 had made us a better world. Don't forget without computers we be who we are.
1	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because on page @NUM1 it talk about how the cyclist had to go down a hill then find a factory for juice. Like if the cyclist don’t find any building he would of kept the hill and wasted the little bit of energy for actaire.
1	Since the cyclist was really thirsty, the setting was not very appealing considering it was a desert. You could tell she was stressing because she was sweating and having a trouble time trying to pedal.
1	The setting effects the cyclist in away that most people can’t tell cycling forty miles on maybe a gallon of water is hard expecialy in California “I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly and I was traveling through the high desserts of California in June” The effect on his body would be rather devastating.
1	In the story the Features of the setting affects the cyclist is that when he is riding he has very little water. Also he takes advise from old men and he meets up with an @CAPS1 Snake and he goes down an dirt Road he has no water at the time there. The conclusion is that he comes of the dirt Road and @CAPS2 the main Road that he travels. Also he promised to stick to it in the @CAPS3. That is how you should stick things at in the future.
1	The biker has many features in his story. For example he has discriptive words that put pictures into my head. For example “One long, crippling hill” I can picture it in my head. “There was no one in sight.” All of these parts of the story put pictures in my head. Thats a good thing, for example you want the reader to understand it, and by having discribing words help.
2	The features of the setting affect the cyclist. One way is that the “rolling hills” @MONTH1 let the rider get more tired. Another way is that of water from severe heat. And finally the path you take along the way and how many stops you make along the way. The heat, lack of water, rolling hills, and the advice you get can result badly by affecting the outcome. A rider should make a plan and use determination to get to where they need to go.
2	The setting in the story “Do not exceed posted speed limit” reflect upon the cyclist. In the story a cyclist is riding his bike and takes directions from some old men. Later he realizes the old men probably had no idea that things change overtime. He says “Never accept travel advice from a collection of old-timers who haven’t left their porches since carter was in office.”(Kurmaskie @NUM1). The cyclist takes the old-timers “shortcut” and it takes forever to reach his destination. At the end he reaches his campsite and another person askes him for directions. This time the cyclist says “Yes, sir! I own a very good map,” and “I’d always stick to it in the future.” The cyclist’s message is to follow a map, something you know is right, not a person that @MONTH1 be lying or irresponsible.
2	The features of the setting affect the cyclist by making him dehydrated and hot. He was in deserts on a bicycle with his water support running low and rough road with plenty of hills to make it hard for a bike to out come. he kept going though the heat was outrageous and dehydration beginning to overcome him.
2	I think the boy should ask you directions for the place were he is going. He can reach the place without water but that is not a good thing to do.
2	The features of the setting affect the cyclist’s mood throughout the essay. Joe @CAPS1 starts with being happy and confident to determined yet help helpless and then to relief. Joe writes, “Things began well enough… flat roads…” This quote suggests that in the beginning, everything was okay. He started out with a “smile on the face.” (@NUM1) @CAPS2, things start to change @CAPS1 hits changing terrain. He writes, “…I noticed the terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short rolling hills.” This quote states the changing terrain. He starts to lose water to keep him going, yet he pushes himself to the next “town”. Finally, when the author reaches “Gary &amp; Wilber’s fish camp” he is relived when he sees an old guy sitting. The two men say, “know The best way to get There? “Yes sir! I own a very good map.” This reveals that Joe didn t ask for more directions which was his first mistake. In addition, changes in setting can chang a persons mood and attitude.
10	Computers have helped people tramendisly over the past years. Thanks to computers scientist have found cures for desesse, jobs have become easier . I believe that computers have a baseline effect on people. Because they educate people with their jobs, and give people a chance to talk to people having to pay for anything. If someone to a country that they have they might go on the computer to learn more about that country and their culture. Another thing they might do @CAPS1 go to a website that could help them find affordable . If a child @CAPS1 doing a report about a country in @LOCATION1 thay can go on the computer to find out facts on that country. Computers educate people about about places all over the world, you can go on a website that has videos and written sheet clips about what has been goin on around the world and learn about current events. My grandmother would tell me stories about @CAPS3 @CAPS4 before they had computers, now my dad works on @CAPS3 @CAPS4 and he tells me stories about his day. when you compair the two different decades it saids like computers help out a lot within @CAPS3 @CAPS4. Before computers stores would have to do math in their pad when they were giving change back to people, now people save by punching in the numbers in the computer. I think the computers have helped people with their jobs. When you talk on the phone to someone it costs you money. When you just want to see someone I'l costs you money to get on a phone . with computers you can , or onstant message people with any costs. If you want to see a friend for her @CAPS9 but dont have the money to fly halfway around the world to see her you can vidieo chat with her. Computers help people save money by talking on the computers with friends, family and even co-workers. Computers have been very helpful ever since they were invented. They help people learn about places all over the world and about anything you want to learn about. They also make jobs and work easier and also help people save a lot of money by talking to people on the computers insted of on the phone. Computers have improved demastrecly over the years, the screens use to be so small and you would have to press all these buttons just to open it up and now computers can be as big as a flat @CAPS10 and can turn them on with just a push on a button,, Who knows what computers will be like @NUM1 years from now?
11	Dear local newspaper, Are computers a bad thing? Certainyly not! They can be distracting but in a enlighting way. How? Computers give you extra knowledge, you can connect with people and if you think they take away exercise, they do not, they can actually help exercise! My first reason that computers are a positive device to have is they can give you extra knowledge. That is great for the brain! When you are sitting at home with a ton of, think again, the computer is there for you. Ask or search anything and you should have a @PERCENT1 guarentee your answer will be found! If you feel like you do not know many interesting subjects like a culture of some sort or something that you heard your computer can tell you. Just one computer can enlighten you with so much. Now when you go back to school you can brag and say &quot;@CAPS1 you know,?&quot; People will be amazed. Lately experts have been concerned that the computer device is a distracting item and it will keep you from exercising and enjoying nature, @CAPS2, no need to worry you can learn just nabcur anything on nature when you surf the web! You @MONTH1 find out more of what is in your maryard then you already knew. Exercise! Are you worried you do not get enough exercise? @CAPS2 then, go onto youtube.com, type in exercise and work out. You will come up with millions of exercise routines you can do right infront of your computer. Another thing you can do it get online for how to stay healthy and exercise! Lastly the experts is have been that we people are not having a sccial life and interacting with our family and pals. I would say we spend more time interacting with our buddies and close ones online then we do in public. With sites like facebook, @CAPS3, @CAPS4, @CAPS5, and more we are talking to those people instantly! We are setting up our weekend plans online and a lot of our social life is there. Sometimes we have family that lives long distance, no one wants to pay for a call so we have the internet to connect! In a nut shell, knowledge, exercise, and connecting with buddies are all positives in the computer. You can multi-tase so simply with just one electronic device and that is the computer! Experts, you do not need to worry.
1	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because it is in the desert it is in the summer. It affect the cyclist because he is riding a bike. For exsempl in the story he is running out of water. He is starting to git dehyjradid.
1	The setting affected the cyclist because of the mood and how everychange happened. For instance when the setting changed the cyclist felt different and it really affected him. Like if the setting was all sunny in a nice town then he would feel good but if he was in a dark town he wouldn’t feel very happy. So the setting really affected him.
1	After sometime into his trip he mentioned “I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June.” I believe that this setting had gotten him determined to keep on pedaling so he could live. But then he started to think he might die, but he wasnt sad or upset, he was happy. He had sort of chuckled to himself, because of the fact that he might die because he listend to some old men. In my opinion I think he was having the time of his life peddeling through this setting of California.
2	Where cyclist was gave him more disadvantages, then advantages. The advantages were their were hills to go down. Disadvantages hills to go up, water running out when he is in the middle of no where, very hot out, and is lost in the desert, doesn’t have much hope until he see's the factory. Biggest disadvantage is he is on a bike, and not in a car. So he has no @CAPS1 and has to pedel to keep going. But being in the desert on a bike with no water, and you are last, is quite bad. He is very lucky that he made it up the hill or else he would’ve died out there. And he thought he was seeing things good thing he checked it out. I think for future refrence ride in a car, don’t use a bike in the desert, its not to smart.
1	The features of the setting affects the cyclist because when all the cyclist is worried about is finding a place with water all he’s doing is getting scared and panicing. In other words, when he’s looking around, the setting he sees is like desert and no buildings. The story says, “I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June” when he sees that he panics and thinks he’s not gonna make it which affects him mentally.
1	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in different ways The woman who had listen to the older men to get where she was going had made her run out water and almost died of thirst. As she was going to this place she had seen a snake “At some point, tumble weeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake it really did look like a diamondback” (@NUM1). She started to see things that wasn’t there.
2	He was affected by lack of water, the hills, snake in the way and the condition of the road.” The water bottles contained only a  few tantalizing sips. ” This quote explains how the lack of water was a problem. The hills affected him by they were “crippling&quot;. The snake it was long ways on the road and he didn’t know how to get passed it . Finally the   roads were rough and you should go  over the speed limit of 55 mph. So he was affect in a lot of different ways not just one.
3	The features of the barren desert path make the cyclist quite nervous, but they also make him determined to escape them. He passes “ghost towns,” “abandoned buildings,” and diamondback snakes. These are images traditionally associated with being lost in the deserts, and would be enough to instill fear in most anyone travelling alone. The author even remarks that sadists are probably finding his story pleasing. He often mentions fears of “dropping” dead, being eaten by vultures, and, at one point, even wishing death upon himself via choking albeit jokingly. And yet he was determined to live. In spite of the odds stacked against him, he moved on, even after losing “what (he) believed to be (his) lost burst energy.&quot; He even maintains a sense of humor throughout, writing of a diary entry that would be left behind that remarks on the wisdom of old men. In the end, when he finds a place to rest, he turns it all into a lesson he’ll surely abide by: follow the map!
1	The cyclist is affected by the heat, the hills, and the lack of people. For example, the cyclist was growing short on water and had “wide rings of dried sweat on his on shirt,” and he could “drop from heatstroke.” The hills must have forced him to use more energy, and lasely  the land of people. If the towns still had people the cyclist wouldn’t have been as affected by the setting.
1	Features of any setting affect what you do and how you do it. Features affect the cyclist by water, help, and saftey. “I’d read once that sucking on stones helps take your mind off thirsty by allowing what spit you have to circulate.” This quote so his desperate need for water by saying he sucks a on rock to drink his own spit. The rough terrain and abandoned road the old men sent him on that was out of date, made him unable to ask for directions, and to even know if he is travelling correctly. Along the road he meets a snake. Being so far away from civilization, if he was to have gotten bit then he would have no one to help save him from dyeing on the side of the road. Also, if he was to have a heatstroke he has no water and no help. Safty, help, and water are all factors which contribute to the features, and how they effect the cyclist.   
10	Dear editor, Have you ever stopped and asked yourself which was more important? Of course I can be talking about anything, but what about computers verses family, friends, nature, your own health etc. Well, I ask myself that quite often, and I feel that it's so much more worth it to be with family and friends than to be infront of a computer. There is so much more that I can tell you, and just after my very first reason how could there even be another side to it? Why is it that now these days kids can't simply run out to the bus stop without feeling totally winded? I feel it's because they are not getting enough well needed exercise! For example, instead of sitting infront of the computer, kids, and even adults can enjoy going to the gym. Also, children can get more involved with school sports so they can not only be participating in sports, but they can be involed with school too! Lastly, just by going for a short walk with your dog, your not only walking and getting well needed exercise, your bonding with your loyal friend. Have you ever been gazing out the car window when you just found yourself being sucked into all the beauty that nature has to offer? Well, if you have I guess you could never have too much, but if you haven't, its probably because your spending way too much time on the computer! There are so many different ways that people could learn to appreshiate nature more, such as sitting on a park bench in the @TIME1, while absorbing the fresh air and sunlight. Or you could go for a slow, realaxing bike ride through a trail with a constant cool breeze, brushing your face with every of your wheels. Finally, you could pick a warm day to sit out on the beach, and listen to some music, next to the salty ocean. How could you resist those temptations? Lastly, I believe that family is the most important thing to missing out on! Without family and friends you miss out on so many good ethics and experiences. You lose out on having good lifetime realationships, and how could you turn dow the offer to be with the people you love? In conclusion, I feel that computer are taking away most of the things that no one deserves to live without. I mean, how could anyone live without family, friends, the beauty of nature, and your own health? That is why everyone should make the right desition to take reasponcible charge of their life, and the same question, which is more important?
2	The features of the setting make the ride for the cyclist very hard. It has a lot of hills, which would make him use more energy. Also, it is a desert, so it is very hot and dry. This makes the author need more water than he normally would. The author said “…I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June.” The author knew that it was very dangerous to travel there without water, he said “…I could drop from heatstroke…” If the setting had been cooler there would not be so much danger.
3	The cyclist’s features around him affected him negatively. He was cycling through “the high deserts of California in June” (Kurmaskie @NUM1). His water bottle was slowly running outand the only town he came to that had water had water that tasted like batteryacid. Events seemed pretty bad, until the speaker became elated when they saw a @ORGANIZATION1 factory. The author was thirsty and the side of the building had “A sandblasted picture of a young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice into his mouth” (Kurmaskie @NUM1). The building was abandoned. The speaker then states “Somehow  I climbed away from the abandoned factory of juices and dreams, slowly gaining elevation while losing hope” (Kurmaskie @NUM3). He lost hope after that landscape, and he pretty much gave up. The landscape or features affected the author very negatively due to the lack of water.    
1	The setting affects the cyclist because there were lots of hills and very little water.
2	The cyclist in the story rough road ahead Do not exeed posted speed limit, by Joe kurmashie, is heavily affected by the features of the setting in the story. First is the ‘shorecay’ that is suggested to get    to @CAPS1, which naturally just ends up separating him from all other people and putting him in the middle of nowhere with a limited supply of water. His water shortage is the second thing that affects him because it makes him despair and feel that he is about to collapse and die. In the story, he says: ‘It really didn’t matter. I was going to die and the lards would pick me clean.’ This shows that the features at the setting made him feel hopeless.
1	Many features of the setting affected the cyclist in “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” by Joe Kurmaskie. One feature that affected the character was the heat of the sun. The narration states” The sun was beginning to beat down” (@CAPS1).
3	The features of the setting greatly affected the cyclist in the story “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit”. In the story it says, &quot;I was traveling through the high desert of California in June.&quot; This is telling the reader that the weather was hot and you need a lot of water here to survive, especially if you are riding a bike or working. Later on in the story it says, &quot;I eased past, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state.&quot; This quote gives the reader information and tells us that the cyclist is having a hard time surviving through the harsh features of the setting through the harsh features of the setting. In California deserts I know from prior knowledge it is hot and dry, exspecially in the summer. If you are working outside, like the cyclist in this story is, and you do not have water to drink, you will get dehydrated which eventually leads to death. The author does a good job showing the readers how the setting affects the cyclist.
3	In the essay “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” the features of the setting affects the cyclist in many ways. One thing is the water. There is little water and it is boiling hot. He took some taste of it. He said “It tasted like battery acide.” To me if the water is hot don’t taste it. Another thing is the land. The land went from straight to hilly. That started slowing him down. Last, is the day time. It started turning dark and he was still biking. He wanted to get as far as he could.
1	The features in the setting affected the cyclist when he got tired very easily because he was biking in the desert in June. There are no rivers in the that desert so he couldn’t get water. It is so hot out there that he couldn’t see very well because of all the sweat that went into his eyes. Also there are no people out there because of how hot it is.
1	In the essay “Rough Road Ahead, Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit ” the setting affected the cyclist. The setting affected the cyclist mentally and physically, when the setting was nice he had a positive outlook and was full of energy. Later in the essay, as the setting grew less appealing, and more treaterous, the cyclist grew weary and distressed.
1	A cyclist always has to face many problems such as the weather, the condition of the road, etc.
9	Dear Local Newspaper, @CAPS1 you think computer have good or bad effects on people? It has been bought to @CAPS10 mind that people fight about @CAPS3 computers to @CAPS2 a doubt I think that computers have a positive on people. @CAPS10 think arguments are people find ability in talk online with other people and help with school work. First of all computers gieve in ability to learn about faraway places. This is really helpful @CAPS3 you @CAPS3 you want to learn about @CAPS4 you can go at the computer end google &quot;@CAPS4 @CAPS6&quot;. By doing this you'll find a lot of info on @CAPS4. I should I tried it before. So that computers giving you this ability to learn about faraway places is really helpful to the human society. Second of all computers people to talk to other people around the world. This is really helpful @CAPS3 you want to learn about people from around the world. This is different than googling fatcs about other people. This is free because @CAPS3 you google @CAPS3 your online chat with someone you have a In @CAPS10 thoughts thats the best way to is helpful friends and family @CAPS3 they dont have of all computer can help with school work. This is helpful students could and the world or about a different This remind me of the time I had to @CAPS1 a project about the nine planets. I had to find a lot of info so that also means a lot of books and a lot of reading. So these I the easiest and fastest way to @CAPS1 @CAPS10 project. I went on the internet in @CAPS10 and get all the info that I needed. So then I completed @CAPS10 project and headed it in to @CAPS10 teacher. She gave me a @PERCENT1 for a project grade. I got a @PERCENT1 because I misspelled @CAPS10 name, but that doesnt matter. What I am to tell you is that computers help students with school work like projects. @CAPS2 thinking I know that computer have a positive effect on @CAPS10 three arguments is that computers give you ability to learn about faraway places, allow you to talk online with other people, and help you with school work. Please take @CAPS10 side and think that computers have a positive effects on human society.
3	The features in the setting, affected the cyclist in many ways. The first way the features in the setting affected the cyclist is that the whole trail was desearted leaving him alone with no water. In the story it says “This place might have been a thriving little spot at one time – say, before the last world war – but on that morning it fit the traditional defination of a ghost town, “this explains that he was alone and that the first town he visited was deserted. The next example of how the features and the settings
2	The featers of the setting afected the cyclist by the lack of water made him tiered and a bit deloshional. The lack of shade increased the rate of dehidrashion. The rough road made it hard to balinc. And the snack slowed him dowen. He thought that he was going to die.
2	The setting of the story &quot;Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,&quot; is very important to the events that occured in the  story. For example the story was set on a  highway set at @NUM1 which the cyclist was only able to do @NUM2. This is signifigant to the events of the story because since he was doing @NUM2, which by the away is a lot for a cyclist and it led to almost dehydration. Plus it was hilly. This led to the excution of the cyclist, so one could see that setting is very important to the outcome of the story.
1	The setting is in a California which isn’t really the coolest of places to be.[temperature]
3	At the beginning of his journey, the cyclist is relaxed and the features of his environment. He says, “I enjoyed the seranety of an early- summer evening.” At a campground in @LOCATION1, the setting is calming and relaxing. At the first town, the setting is shocking, but humorous to the cyclist and he starts to get nervous. After looking around he says. “this sight was trowoling”. The cyclist tip gets worse when he reads for the next town. “flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.&quot; This part of his journey affects him the most. His environment and the features of the land have made him tired and thirsty. The setting has a major role for a cyclist.
3	In the essay &quot;Rough Road Ahead; Do not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,&quot; by Joe kurmaskie, the setting is integral to how the cyclist feels and behaves. The cyclist feels a growing desperation as the setting around him gets progressively move bleak. In the beginning of the trip, the cyclist encounters a ghost town. &quot;I chuckled, checked my water supply, and moved on.&quot; The cyclist is still thinking positively at this point in the essay. A while later, the cyclist comes across another abandoned set of buildings. He feels that this sight is &quot;troubling.&quot; @CAPS1 the cyclist is worried, he is not yet depressive and pessimistic. Farther down the road, the terrain of the road changes, and he sees the sign that gives the essay its name.&quot; The speed limit was 55 mph. I was doing a water depleting @NUM1. Sometimes life’s can feel so cruel.&quot; The cyclist’s surroundings get progressively worse as he rides on, but even tually he finds a place with working water. He is so overjoyed by this building that he wants to find the owners, and kiss them.
3	Some features of the setting that affect the cyclist is he is riding a bike through the dessert. He says “I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June.” So he was scortching hot peddling a bike. The road became bumpy and curry. A sign had said “Rough Road Ahead: Do not exceed posted Speed limit. The speed limit was @NUM1 and he was going @NUM2 so it must have been hard to get over all the bumps. The lastly he comes across and poisioness snake blocked the majority of the pavement infront of me.” So him dehydrated trying to get ground a snake would be terrifying. So on his @CAPS1 the setting doesn’t help him much.  
2	The cyclist ran into many issues in his/her travel to @LOCATION1. They had to dismiss many hardships such as lack of water, being lost, immense desert heat, plus minor things like snakes and road conditions. The setting of the California desert in June was the most intense hardship. That and the lack of water. Though the heat starting powing at the cyclists’ brain by making them see mirages, etc. The heat and entire setting made the cyclists’ travel much harder.
2	The setting affect the cyclist because in the hot heat of California in June which nobody wants to be outside. But first, was the heat which took a lot out of his body while trying to keep it cool. Then came the factor of which he had very little water when he reached the first town and in the story it said, “A tar like substance oozed out, followed by brackish water feeling somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees.” So now he has no cool water to drink when he says, “Not two miles into the next section of the ride, I noticed the terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.” So the cyclist has very little water is not having to endoor the hardest part of the ride. Then later on he makes a mention to change a paragraph if he loss consciousness. Also he talked about him might getting a heatstroke. Hinting to the fact that the setting he was in was affecting him in many different ways.
3	The setting of the essay “Do not exceed posted speed limit,&quot; is very dry, sandy, hot, and deserted. On his way to Yosemite he takes a “short cut&quot; from so he do me through the desert. When he first leaves its in a hot and flat part of the desert. His mood is high and her has confidence. “Things began well enough. I rode into the morning with strong legs and a smile of my face.” With this he arrives at the first “town” but hes wasn’t worried he had bad plenty of water he moves on. The terrain starts working against him in his search for water, “Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills a large high way sign jumped out at he. It read: Rough Road Ahead : Do not Exceed posted speed limit.” This lowers his confidence, especially because everything is deserted and if he has a heat stroke no one would he around to find him. He keeps up his determination we he sees the factory yet he moves on. When he see the first comp he is overwhelmed  with relief and the terrain flattens out again. When asked if he need direction he say he has his own map so he can keep stick to the terrain he knows is rest. He can keep his hopes for himself and follow a true set of directions.
10	Dear, local news time editor using a @CAPS1 daily has a positive effect on people, wouldn't you agree? People should use a @CAPS1 more often. I think everyone should have at least one or two computers in their house, they were invented for a reason. Computers allow you to interact with friends and family, help you with school work and, I guarantee that you will have a good time using a @CAPS1 by playing games and meeting new people. If you have school work to finish, computers help will work. If you need to do some research, you can just go to a website google and what you needed to know will be right in front of your eyes in a matter of seconds. Computers can help you with as well. There is icon inside one of your documents. I read an article on @CAPS1 about @PERSON1 stated that &quot;@CAPS1 users are most likely to succeed in school.&quot; Interacting with friends and family is always a . Maybe you do not understand if you have been assigned in a certain class. You @MONTH1 add a friend and you will tell you what has . Talking to family members can do good for you in many ways. You can be having some trouble in your socical life, you can always talk to a family member or friend secretly through the @CAPS1. I remember having some difficulties with a few friends and one of my cousins gave me very good advice through an instant messaging program named &quot;@CAPS2&quot;. I garantee you will have a good time using a @CAPS1. There are many games out there that you @MONTH1 enjoy. Playing these games, will teach hand-eye coordination, says @PERSON2. You can meet new people who can also give you good advice. As you computers have a lot of positive effect on people. You can interact with family and friends, recieve a lot of help for school work and meet a lot of new people. Take my advice and buy a @CAPS1.
3	Anyone who has ever rode a bike knows how relaxing it can truly be, but when you are forced to ride miles and miles on @CAPS3 terrain without any water, relaxation feels like an oasis, @CAPS1 through beat-up roads with dryness all around you really puts a domper on your experience, @CAPS2  it extends your need for thirst by enhancing the amount of dryness in the air and the amount of energy you are having. The ability to block all of that out and trying to focus on something easier to handle is exactly what you want to do in these situations, @CAPS3 terrain can really build character into a cyclist, but  adding the fact the amount of water he had and the dryness around him, it sounds like torture. I can only hope that if I ever become a cyclist, I never have to endure this kind of situation.
3	The cyclist, Joe Kurmaskie, had a rough time traveling to Yosemite @ORGANIZATION1’l Park. Granted he was misled, but if the conditions of the terrain and if the climate were working for him it wouldve made life a whole lot easier. Not only was it hot, being in a desert in California in June, but he only had one water bottle. One water bottle @MONTH1 have lasted a little longer if it was a straight shot through, but it wasn’t. The roads went up, down, there were hills, there were towns-ghost towns at that. The only water he could pump from the pump was scalding hot and tasted acidic. Also, he wouldn’t have lost as much energy if it was a straight shot. It’s easy to say that he literally roughed it, having to resort to putting rocks in his mouth to circulate saliva. All in all, he was very determined to work through the very unfortunate conditions he had working against him, and very lucky to survive it. 
1	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways For example, the fact that he is pedaling a bike “through the high deserts of California in June, make the intensity level of the story very high. If it would have been @DATE1 and there was a nice breeze it would be different.
2	The features of the setting affected the cyclist by lack of water, poisonous snake, the condition of the rode for example the lack of water affected the cyclist because he couldn't make it wi thout water he could of passed out if he didnt have water. Another example of how the setting affected the cyclist would be the poisonous snake if he would have  goten bitten he could have died cause there would be nobody to help him. And the last example of how the setting affected him would be the conditon of the road because it make it tougher for the cyclist to get to his destination with hills and windy rounds this is how I think the setting affected  the  cyclist.
1	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. One way is that if it’s hot and your riding a long way you need a lot of water so you don’t  dehydrated. Also it can affect your vision cause you looking at the sun. Another way cyclist can get affected by the setting is because what if the road is all bumpy and just not in good shape it can affect the way they ride there bike.
1	 The story “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” by @PERSON1 had some statements that we were kind of pointless to put in. One of sentence in the essay had a couple word that don’t need to be used. In the sentence, about forty miles into the pedal, I arrive at the first “town,” I don’t think “into the pedal needs to be in there because its not describing anything.
2	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. One way is, the setting. The cyclist is out in the dessert, in two-hundred degree weather. With very little water. Also, the cyclist didn`t have a map and he asked someone that hasn`t let their porch since carter was in office. ''Wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June simply because I listened to some gentlemen who hadn`t been off their porch in decades.'' This quote talks about how the setting (@NUM1 degree weather, dessert) can @CAPS1 him. Also, he listened to someone that didn`t know what they were talking about. In conclusion that is how the features of setting affected the cyclist.  
0	The settings of the story is very desert like what I mean by that is its the desert and its hot and he really had to push his self to make it. The condition at the rode are very rough and has a lotof shape turn it in. Apart in the story he gets a boost of energy and pedal as hard as he can down a hill and then relaxes. This is the setting and is summary of the story.
1	The setting affected the cyclist because the condition of his surrounding it was hot so he got dehydrated more and needed more water. There were a lot of hills so he had to pedal harder and use more energy to get up the hills. There were no cars, building, smog, just nature. It was peaceful and relaxful ride on the bike thats the setting affects the cyclist.
3	Features of the setting affect the cyclist in a great way His journey would not be as difficult if these factors had not crossed his path. Climate, location, and population all have an effect on the cyclist. In the story, it is told that the cyclist is in the dry climate in California, in the heat of June.Their is also a lack of water, some must pace his sips carefully. Therefore also few towns, making it hard to get good advice and supplies and supplies. The cyclsit also comes across a snake, making him affected by native wild life.  The dry climate and lack of water affects him by having doubt. The cyclist is constantly worried about passing out and dying of dehydration. The cyclist also gets doubts when he sees the road signs reminding him how slow he is going. The snake also has a depressing effect about his dangers on his journey. All of these things in the setting affected the cyclist. His journey does teach you though, that trough determination you will be rewarded. You have to want things bad enough and put the effort into it. The author also teaches you to always have a positive attitude to get success.
9	How much of your free time daily to you spend on the computer? It is proven that people too to fifteen years old spend an average of @NUM1 - @NUM2 hours of their free time on a computer. People age sixteen to forty-eight spend @NUM1 - @NUM4 hours of free time daily on their computer. Too much time on the computer can interfere with physical activities, social time, and health issues. Computers have some good advantages here and there but mostly result in a negative effect. In this post decade, the percentage of exercise was gone down and computer bills have gone up. Americans have now spent most of the time web surfing, playing online games, and interacting with online chat rooms. After school, kids go home and turn their computer on instead of going outside running and playing. More people across the country have gained weight due to unhealthy food and no physical exercise. Many local sports have lost teammates due to lack of desire for physical activities because of computers. Many people have stopped going out with friends and family due to going on the computer. The that runs through @CAPS1 minds these days is 'why go out to talk to my friends, when I can talk them online?' I think the opposite. Get out of the gloomy house and go out to see my friends. I don't even go online within every days. I check online for homework and in online shopping twenty minutes. Computers have a major effect on social lives like going out and being confident to meet new people. Lastly, health issues are raising rapidly! The reason we now have shows on @CAPS2 about people with weight and health problems can relate very much so back to the negative effect on people. Like @CAPS3 @CAPS4, and the obese have shown how people gain weight. I think at least @PERCENT1 of these people spend to much time on the computer and not exercising. Eating @PERSON1's then goint home to play online games will definately increase health issues like weight, organs being unhealthy, muscles not functioning properly, and eye and brain damage from starring at a mouse and screen nonstop. People should stop spending so much time on the computer and get outside or get active because computer use does have a negative effect. It interferes with social time, health, and physical activities. Get up and prevent the negative effects of computers.
2	The features and settings affected the cyclist because of all the dangers of doing it. He took advice from old people to do it. But even though it started out good almost nothing last forever. Hes riding a like in the middle of summer with little water and in the desert. He runs into towns that are abandon and the next town is only @NUM1 miles are litheraly going to be rough roads ahead. But when he did get to the town that was abandon to. until he found hope and seeing a man in a chair 
1	The features of the setting affects the cyclist by not being in town. I say this Because the cyclist talks about “old timeres who haven't left the contines of their porches since carter was in office.&quot; So that means he dousen't know were he's at.
2	In the cyclists journey to Yosemite, several factors hinder him from reaching it. The first is obviously the false information given to him by the elders. The second is that because the information wasn’t true, the cyclist had an insufficient amount of water. This made him dehydrated. The last is the fact that the route given to him included obstacles such as snakes, rocky roads, and old ghost towns and abandoned buildings which made the cyclist less confident. Those are the features of the setting which affected the cyclist
2	The setting affects the cyclist because one he should have stack to his own map. He should have packed an extra bottle of water. @NUM1 not take any advice from people that haven’t left the porch in years.
3	The setting affects the cyclist mood in the story the cyclist takes a short cut with many abandon towns, and buildings as well as a bumpy, terrain. When he came to a fork in his path that had a water pump he immediately began to pump it the water was not good for drinking. He was determined to make it to the next town. “I could make that” he said. Because of the ghost town and the old pump he had to continue on. When the cyclist came to a sign in the road warning him about the road a hed he began to get depressed, “I was sad”. Finally when he reached @CAPS1 and @CAPS2 Fish Camp he was thankful and wanted to show his gratitude. The setting can affect a cyclist by his mood at first the cyclist is determined but as the setting gets worse his mood and hopes go down the drain. At the end when the setting is bright so is his mood.
1	The features of the setting affected the cyclists because he was thirsty and it was hot and he was almost out of water and he almost died because when he was drinking the water and he hit a bump and spit got lodged in his throat and tiring hills it seemed to never end.
2	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because he wasnt pre pared in the beginning, the cyclist got directions from an old man who hadnt left his porch in years so he wouldnt know what had changed. Then the cyclist starts his journey with not a lot of water. When he got to the second town “I notice the terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short rolling hills.’ This quote means that he wasn’t expecting hills, he thought it was going o be a flat way. Also in the @NUM1 degree whether with limited water supply, he couldnt ride up and down hills. Going down the hills gave him a break. Thats how the cyclist was affected by the settings features.
3	Alot of factors effected the cyclist. Temperature, terrain, directions all gave the cyclist doubt. The temperature through the high deserts of california left the cyclist feeling hot, parched and irratable. Through the story, he had all but a few slips of his water left. Knowing your running low of water “to feel sorry for himself” The cyclist had biked so far the terrain started to change from flat to “rolling hills”. This could impact someone greatly who has never biked on different levals before. Lastly, the feeling of hoped could have effected him the most. Not believing in yourself is the hardest thing to overcome. Having just liesurly taken instructions by an old man cost the cyclist hours of torture. The author did a great job using hyperbole to exagerate the cyclists feeling of lost hope . He also used very detailed text to paint the reader a picture. These literay elements made it easier for me to understand the effect of the temp, terrain and hope had on the biclist.
1	The features of the setting really affect the cyclist. He is led into false pretenses by the immediate surroundings. Little does he know that it would bring him into danger? When he comes to a rock in the road and finds that the water pumps are not good he is in serious danger. In the reading it says “The sun was beginning to heat down, but it hardly noticed. The cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite had my name written all over them.” The setting let the cyclists mind wonder so much that he didn’t even realize the heat.
3	In the short story, “Do Not Exceed Posted speed limit,” by Joe Kurmaskie, expresses the features of the setting like the lack of water, and can not find help to the end affects the cyclist in the story. During his time of need the cyclist says, “It didn’t really matter. I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean, leaving only some expensive outdoor gear and a diary with the last entry in praise old men their wisdom.” The cyclist has a lack of necessities in the features around him and is letting his pride fall down; giving up on hope. When the cyclist finds hope, “And drank deeply from the sink, I had an overwhelming urge to seek out Gary and Wilber, kiss them, and buy some bait.” The cyclist was astonished of what he had stumbled onto and appreciated that he was still alive. The cyclist should not have taken the old peoples advice for granted, but will now look onto people’s sense of directions.
8	Dear local newspaper I support the advances in technology. I am going to tell @NUM1 thinks way. One is on a rainy day. I don’t think you are going to go out an play in the rain so you could go on the computer and play games. Talk to friends. Or you could use the computer for school work or for work. Say that you have to look something up for school and you can't get to the liebery, but you have a computer at your house. You can use it to find info. You can use the computer to learn how to do something like making somthing and a lot more. You can use the computer after school if you cann't go out and hang with your friends. You can do something with them online. Last things you can ask your friends if there is homework so you don't miss it. So that is why I support advanes in technology.
1	Setting affects many things in stories. The setting in this story affected the cyclist. The setting was very hot and it slowed him do wn a lot. For example he said he was doing 55 miles
3	The setting in the story was the “high deserts of California in June.” At first the cyclist had seemed really confident and excited about his journey. It was during it that had changed his mind. The cyclist was running low on his water supply's so he stops and pumps water from this water pump but all he gets is this acid taste. So he is on his way to the nearest town which is @NUM1 miles away and he thinks he can make it. So he is heading towards the nearest town when the terrain starts changing. It changes from flat road to short rolling hills. During this time the cyclist starts loosing hope. He thinks that he is going to die of dehydration and the birds are going to pick him apart. Then when he thought he couldn’t make it he saw a sign that said “Gary and @CAPS1 fish camp” He ran into the shop and took long drinks from the sink in the bathroom and when he went out of the store an older gentle men asked him if he needed help and he said no I have a really good map. The thot temperature and rolling hills have a negative effect on the cyclist. I mean he goes from being confident to thinking he is seeing mirages and dieing. It states in the story “I wiped the sweat from my eyes to make sure it wasn’t a mirage” and “I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean” So this brought self doubting behavior. 
1	The features of the setting of were the cyclist are affect them very drastically. They need a water supply and if they don’t have one they might dehydrate or even die. They need shade trees because it keeps the sun from beaming down on them so hard. They also need to cycle when its not as hot outside so that just incase there water gets low there is a better chance of survival. It would be great if there was someone with you to help if you get hurt. There should be buildings near by just incase of an emergency. It might even be good to carry a cell phone.
3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in more than one way. The first features were a ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a corral that couldn’t hold in the lamest mule. These items gave the cyclist a feeling of doubts. They made him begin to think he had taken the wrong route when he saw these things were outdated. Then, he couldn’t get any cold,clean water out of the pumps to save his life. This was the first obstacle which affected him. The next features of the setting which caused a problem were the tumbleweeds and &quot;a ridiculously large snake.” They made the cyclist scared and caused him to go around these things. You can tell he wass scared because he quoted “I eased past.” When the flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills, the cyclist’s journey became exhausting,never ending, and difficult. Two more things affected the cyclist. These two things consist of the signs. One of which read “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit&quot; and the other “GARY AND WILBER'S FISH-IF you want bait for the big ones, we’re your BEST BET.&quot;The first sign affected him in a negative way and caused him to become a little angry and frustrated because he was tired and dehydrated and the rough road ahead gave him no hope. The second sign led him to water which was the one thing that would make things better so it had a positive affect. These are features that had an affect on the cyclist.
3	The setting affected the cyclist: due to the changes in terrain. A rough spot for the cyclist was when the terrain changed from a flat stretch to rolling hills. The author wrote, “I tolld on&quot;(Kurmaskie @NUM1). The cyclist was pushing through the rough and it was not an easy stretch to get through. Another place in the cyclist's trip that was difficult was when he saw the abandoned juice factory. The narration states, “over one long, crippling hill, a building came into view&quot;(Kurmaskie @NUM1). The context clues that provide information that it wasn't easy are the words &quot;long&quot; and &quot;crippling.&quot; @CAPS1 of those words provide feelings of being drug on through the rough setting of the cyclist's trip.
3	The cyclist had experienced some hard obstacles on his ride to Yosemite. He had gotten directions from a group of old men who haden’t gone the places they told him about in a long time. Where they said there would be a town it was more like a ghost town. The day that the cyclist was riding was very hot and he was riding through the desert, @CAPS1 made it worse. Because of the heat he was drinking his water regularly to stay hydrated. This meant he was running out of it fast since the old men had given him directions through places that were no longer open he couldn’t get more water. The cyclist also had to go over roads that were in bad condition @CAPS1 slowed him down even more. Those features at the setting affected the cyclist a lot on his trip.
1	Many features of the setting affect the cyclist. In the beginning, he cannot get water and becomes dehydrated, then, he goes on a rough ride and loses more energy. Then he finds the bait and gets water. All of these greatly affect the cyclists condition.
2	The setting of the cyclist’s journey effected him because if he was a tot desert in california. This effected him because he had to ride a bike throug it and he heat took a lot out of him. He didn’t have a lot of water because there were no rivers or water supply because of the desert surrounding him. At the end he finds a store which affects him because he gets a cool drink and same supplies which helped him. So in the end his surroundings destroyed him and then relieved him.
2	The bicyclist was riding to Yosemite National Park and on the way ran out of water. &quot;The wate bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips.” Then, hills came into play which makes you more tired and thirsty. “Flat road was replaced by short rolling hills.” The rider didn’t think he would live “I was going to die and the birds would pick he clean” but he found a place to get water “drank deeply from the sink” and finished his ride.
3	In the story “Do not exceed Posted Speed Limit” by Joe Kurmaskie, the setting affected the cyclist a lot. At first, when the cyclist set off in the morning, the conditions were great. It was breezy with shade from trees and rivers. Then, after a few hours, the cyclist was in the desert with bumpy hills. In the story, the speaker states, “Not two miles into this next section of the ride, I noticed the terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.” The condition of the roads and not having water really affected the cyclist. It took more energy to get up and down the hills without any shade which ment that he needed more water which he didn’t have any. The condition of the setting really affect the cyclist and if it was easier to bike, they might have not be so dehydrated.
9	Dear @CAPS1, Everyone love computers right? Those computers can help us with anything. They also give people facts about faraway places. And not only that but if you have someone that live's away, you can chat with them online! What would this world be with no computers. First of all, I would like to talk about how computer can help us with anything. Computers can give us picture of places, you can watch videos, and even see movies for free! Also you can check the weather, and if going to an airport you can check the flight time or if it has been canceled or not. There is just so many things that the computer can help us with! Now, it can also give you facts opinions, pictures, videos, and movies about faraway places. Like one time I was going to @LOCATION1 to visit but there was a terrible storm over there so the flight was canceled and I went on the computer and checked and it told me that it was canceled. Also if you somewhere faraway you can watch videos about that place. They also have maps to guide you through the way. And not only that but you can also check the highway for traffic so you wouldn't be stuck there. Wow imagine living without a computer! Third of all, if you can chat online with your friends or family! If you miss someone or you just want to talk there is websites that let you do that. Like @CAPS2, @CAPS3, and @CAPS4! And you also see the person if you attach a camera to you computer, it's called video-chatting. And you can do this anyone, anywhere, at any time! In conclusion, all of this can only be done with a computer. Helping you with anything. Giving people facts about faraway places. And, you can talk online. There's many more but for you to know that you'll need to go to the store and get yourself a computer!
1	The features of the setting was affect the cyclist by disturb them to ride in road, limite their speed, and make their distance longer than the original travel plan. For example, the features at the setting was disturb the cyclist to ride in road because it tells them where they can go and where they can’t and they shouldn’t do this or that such as the sign of “no entering” or “one way”. Second, it’s limite their speed because if the features of the setting it said the limited speed is @NUM1, the cyclist only can ride about @NUM1 and go no more further which can make the cyclist longer time to reach the place that they want to go and couldn’t travel faster. Third, it make their distance longer than the original travel plan or exit or how fast they can rode. Such as the sign of “Rough road ahead, do not exceed posted speed limit”. Therefore, the features of the setting was affect the cyclist during the journal.  
3	 The features of the setting affect the cyclist because they doubt or lessen his chances for survival, but the cyclist is determined so he survives.
2	In the essay, the features of the setting affect the cyclist. One feature that affects him is his lack of water:&quot; The water bottles contained only a few tantallizing sips. The lack of water made him very desperate, especially when he came to the welch’s grape juice factory. The  building-abandoned years earlier-had been a welch’s grape juice factory and bottling plant.&quot; This despersion, after he had come to the abondoned factory, was followed by dissapointment and a vague sense of hopelessness expressed by the phrase, &quot;I hung my head&quot; after he had found the abondoned factory. These are some of the features of the setting that affect the cyclist.
2	No water, rough terran, bad info-all are reasons why the boy isn’t doing so well I said no water because he is dehidrated but needs to soae his water. Also he could die from heat exauston. I also said rough terrain because he could fall and get hurt with no one around to help. And to top it off he took info from old people that didn’t know what they were talking about. Theas leave all examples about the essay that support my writing.
2	In the story by Joe Kurmaskie it tells about a cyclists challenge through the heated deserts of California in June. The cyclist had started out with confidence, followed by determination, then relief. The setting affected the cyclist physically and mentally. First, listening to the old men was stupid, then taking the trip not certain if you would have enough water, and lastly traveling through the desert in June. He started getting a little doubtful with himself as well, that won’t help much with bringing success of the trip. Once he had made it to a fish camp an old man even older then the men who gave him the false information told him he knew how to get to Yosemite, but the young man did the best thing and told him he already knew how to get there. He didn’t need to be traveling out in the desert heat for hours that’s just unhealthy
3	A cyclist is affected by many things when riding, most being features of the setting. One feature of the setting that can have an affect is the terrain. If the terrain is rough then the cyclist could have a more difficult time maintaining control of the bike, especially if he is not a professional rider. For example, the author of the essay on page @NUM1 titled: Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Speed Limit, had a hard times on the rougher roads partly due to his level of experience. Another aspect of the environment that can have an affect on a cyclist is the climate. Most people who go cycling ??? know anything about the sport know how to dress for it to keep their body at a comfortable temperature but sometimes the weather plays tricks  on us. The cyclist could get caught in a sudden heat wave to drop in temperature.
2	The features of the setting inhance the cyclist’s desparate spirit. Throughout the whole journey the cyclist is by himself and there are no people, cars, or buildings around. This made him much more desparate because if he would fall of dehydration there would be no one to help him and he would just die. Also, he came upon things such as “Welch’s Grape Juice factory and bottling plant” which got his hopes up, but would soon crush his spirits. These events made him much more desparate because he had no support from anywhere and nothing to fall back on in a life or death situation.
3	In the essay “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” the features of the setting affects the cyclist in many ways. First of all as he was riding about @NUM1 miles up the road, he saw that the terrain was changing and that scared him, he says “This sight was troubling. I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly “(kurmaskie @NUM2). He is saying that as the things around him began to change the more he got scared. And he kept drinking a lot of water just to bring down his fear. Another example is after he had left the sign that told him not to pass. He says “Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills&quot; (kurmaskie @NUM3). This is also an example of fear that started over coming him, when he saw even more changes. He wasn’t going to stop because of the road changes and the fact that his water was almost gone he still had the courage to go further. The setting brought him fear but he made it through.
1	In the story the cyclisst had ran out of water. He had mentioned it tasted like battery acid. The surroundings affected him by looking around and not seeing anybody around for miles. That brings despair. Also a desert with the hot sun beating down on him and just the sand and catus all around. Now if you saw that you would think of no water or shade of noting because the desert is put to image when you hear those descriptions.
2	The features of the setting, in “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” affects the cyclist. The setting affect him both physically and mentally. In the story the setting provides no water for the cyclist making him weak. In the mental aspect he is greatly affected by the features of the setting. An example of this is when so see the abandoned welch's factory and sees the picture of a boy &quot;pour a refreshing glass of juice into his mouth”. This made him hang his head as he rode on. He is also thinking to himself that he will die out of here. This is how the features of the setting affect the cyclist.
8	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I understand that there has been somethings going on with computers. People think they're good. People they're bad. Other people just don't care. People just don't understand the present day. Society is a whole lot different then when parents were kids. People just don't get modern day society. I'm going to tell you the advantages and disadvantages to computers. There are a lot of advantages to computers. You can find information fast. Communication with people around the world is a huge advantage. Computers keep kids and teens entertained. There are games on websites. Computers are the thing we use today. A lot of things are done by computers, computers also prevent you from wasting money on books because you could just google it. There are a lot of disadvantages to computers. They cost a lot of money. Computers can down. There could also be dumb websites that have no purpose like facebook and myspace. Computers are complicated if you don't grow up with them it's hard to learn. The government has all they're information in computers. If they didn't people would be able to steal information a lot. Computers are the greatest thing we've invented so far. It helps with a lot of tasks these days. There are infinite numbers of information in the world and computers help find it. I hope that this letter informed you more about computers. Good and bad things come from this. But, it is mostly good. Kids and teens would be so bored that they would the parents insane.
1	I believe the first photograph closely relates to the story ”As worry” because the authors son suffs a lot. And it shows what he and his friends @MONTH1 look like. Also it shows the surf boards emphasizing there surfers. That is what I believe about the first picture. The second are only relate a little cause it has a surfer surfing. So in conclusion the first photograph is moreaccurate to the story than the second photo.
2	When the bicyclist was trying to find Yosemite he stumbled into a million setting. One in the begining when he was talking to the old men on the porch and having him set of into the distance of nothing but dessert. “one rameshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a corral that couldn’t hold in the lamest mule greeted me.” It’s only him.“ At some point, tumble weeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake – it really did look like ma diamond back-blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me. Tumble weed usually mean's desert. He also saw the @CAPS1 grape juice factory and the bait store where he finally found someone else to give him directions.
2	In the story rough road ahead the cyclest is affected by the setting in many ways. Because he was in a desert in June it was very hot, so he got thirsty. Also because of the heat he could have dehydration of heat strokes. Lastly because it was a desert the wild animals like the snakes and lizards could hurt or posion him and he could die that is how the setting of the story affected the cyclist
3	The cyclist in “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” by @PERSON1 suffers from some hardship while riding through the desert. The features of the setting affected the cyclist by having no water to drink because it was a desert there was no vegetation that means there is no water so he was becoming dehydrated. Also the setting of the towns he went to had no living organisms or people so he also couldn’t quench his thirst there. In one town there was a spiket but the water was gross and hasn’t been pumped in a while. Then he comes to the Welch’s juice factory which was abandoned and from there he thought he was done for but then he finally come to a shop were there are bathrooms were he drinks water from the sink and he is relieved. Also the rocky roads affected him because he barely had any water left, and rocky tent to take more strength and endurance.
3	In the passage DO Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit the desert’s feature did not have any positive affects on the cyclist. The desert contained &quot;rolling hills.&quot; When a cyclist goes over hills it takes more energy due to the laws of gravity. Because the cyclist used more energy to go over the hills he only had enough energy to &quot;feel sorry&quot; for himself. The more hills, the more energy lost, the more tired he became. The desert was also hot, and dry. Obviously, since he was in the &quot;deserts of California in June.&quot; @CAPS1 the would make him become thirsty. He did stop for water but a &quot;tarlike substance&quot; came out instead. When he again stopped later for water it was &quot;cool&quot; and most likely refreshing. Riding his bike in the hilly, dry, hot desert the cyclist became tired and thirsty.
2	The features of the settings effect the cyclist by obstacles in the settings. A obstacle is a object in the way of you and were your trying to go. Some obstacles in the story such as hills, forks in the road, and also rough road. In the story “@CAPS1 Road Ahead @CAPS2 Exceed Posted Speed Limit the rider runs into” a large highway sign jumped out at me it read: Rough road
1	In the story, “Do not exceed posted speed limit”, the setting affects the way that the cyclist rides. In this story, the setting is out in nowhere wit no water, and all he can see is roads. This affects the cyclist because he is hungry, thirsty,and now he's about to go down a really steep hill with fear of crashing and seriously insuring himself with noone around to get help from the setting of nowhere affects the cyclist in this story.
2	The features in the story tell me that it was in a very dry, not populated area. It says that there were rolling hills, in a desert of California, and that it was dry. I think those things affected the cyclist by dehydrating him. Going up and down hills can be very tiring, especially when you don’t have a lot of water left, and need to save some. The quote “I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly, and I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June,” tells me a lot about the story. In a desert in California in June during the summer is a very brave and stupid thing to do. It s twice as hot during the summer.
1	The features of the setting affects the cyclist by not having good directions from old timers. In the text it says, ''Never accept travel advice, from a collection of old timers who haven’t left the confines of their porches since carter was in the office,” this means that the cyclist did not have good directions. Because the road might of changed and the old timers do not know because they been sitting on there porches all the time. The is why I think the salling affects the cyclist.
1	In the essay intitled “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit.” It talks about a gentlemen who is riding a bike to “Yosemite” and he does not know exactly how to get there. So he stops and ask some old folks and he says “Never accept travel advice from a collection of old-timers who haven’t left the confines of their porchers since Carter was in office.” @CAPS1 means they are not familiar with the changes. After he leaves the old-folks he continues on his long hot journey. He begins to run out of water and so he begins to panic. Next he comes to the sign that said “Rough
10	Dear @ORGANIZATION1, A regular day for a person, with a computer, includes at least three hours using the computer per day. Today, people, especially teens, spend their precious hours wasting time on sites like facebook, myspace @CAPS1 and more! Just think about it, just sitting in a chair with your eyes gluded to the computer when you could be exercising, spending time with family and friends or enjoying nature? After all do we really need a computer? Obesity is one of the highest concerns in the country today. However, we can prevent it! We are certainly not helping this issue when we have childre. Adults sitting in a chair for a large part of their day doing absolutley nothing! We are so fortonate, our town has at least two physical fitness buildings for anyone can attend instead of using the computer. ANd even if you can't attend a gym you could easily walk around your neighborhood. There are running program held at our local beach, @LOCATION1, where you can exercise or even run a small competition! Please exercising is key to everybody's health and there are numerous ways to exercise, but using the computer is not one of them! Teachers, parents, children writers everyone lets stay away from the computers and stay fit! Family and friends are those who make us truly hapy but if we on the computer how are we going to see them? More and more people are making less effort to see people in person. Instead many people video chat through cameras on the computer. We need to change this habit. Everybody needs to socialize face to face. If we socialize through computers our socializing skills could worsen because you are not practicing the socializing skills like eye contatct. Instead of talking to people online we could be enjoying with those same people at an amusment park, a restaurant, at a park or simply in our barkyard/house. The world is so beautiful with so many places to see but society is too busy to see it because we're on computer for a long time. Our computers use up so much energy and is a threat to the world, @CAPS2 @CAPS3! Instaed of entertaining ourselves on computer we could be taking hikes, walks on the beach even our street or playing outside in our yard. On a computer you can see a magestic places like beaches but you can't interact with them. If we get off our computer we could be swimming at a beach or a pool! Nature is so beautiful, why ever it? @PERCENT1 of residents in @LOCATION1 own computers and spend a lot of thier day on it. We could be improving obesity, spending more time with family and friends, and exploring Nature! lets make a shange so we can do all of these things!
1	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because it is so hot the cyclist keeps drink and sweating water so he is really work down from dehydration and fatigue. Also just the feeling of how unsafe it is out there. Like how he saw a ridiculously large snake or how it just keep getting hotter.
3	In the essay “Rough Road Ahead; Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” the features of the setting had an affect on the cyclist. The setting and the features affected him not only physically, but mentally as well. The setting caused him to doubt himself and the men and also it kept him from having the energy needed to get to where he was going. Where the cyclist was riding, in California, affected him physically. It was hot, and he had no watter. This caused him to become tired and frustrated. The setting affected him emotionally as well. He started off fine, but as he went on, and as the road slowly changed to hills, he began to get frustrated and angred that he listened to the men. As he saw no buildings in sight for many miles, he began to lose his determination as well as hope. Lastly, when he saw the sign “Gary and @CAPS1 Fish Camp” he started to regain hope and become less frustrated. The setting and features of the essay affected the cyclist not only physically, but mentally as well. He started of determined, then as the setting changed he became doubtful and frustrated. In the end, he turned out satisfied as the setting seemed more hopeful.
1	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. The text first mentions that, “there was no one in sight, not a building, car, or a structure of any kind.” This shows that the cyclist felt in saccure and was starting to upset him. Another example from the text that describes the cyclist is, “One ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a corral that couldn’t hold in the lamest mule greeted me.” You can see through the cyclists that he was frustrated that the water from the pumps were lame. This also could have sparked fear in the cyclist because he was running out of water. He was terrified that since the water tasted like, “battery acid,” that he wouldn’t last much longer. In- conclusion, the features of the setting affected the cyclist in many ways. 
3	In the essay “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” many of the features of the setting affect the cyclist on his journey. The rusty water pump, highway sign and abandoned juice factory all seemed to make his trip more difficult than it already was. First of all, when the author stumbles along a “ramshackle shed” surrounded by “several rusty pumps, and a corral that couldn’t hold in the lames mule”, he is anylous to check the pump for well-needed water. When he finds that he is out of luck and cannot drink the bitter tasting water, his hope droop a little. It is as if the sun were taunting him, telling him that he can’t make it. Secondly, he passes a large road sign reading “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit”. Once again he begins to feel hopeless, but then turns his angst into determination to finish his journey. He says “sometimes life can be so cruel” as he notices the speed limit to be @NUM1, but he continues on, pedaling hard. Lastly, the author sees a lone building in the distance and almost doesn’t believe his eyes. It turns out to be not only his last hope for water, but an abandoned grape juice factory. He reflect on the irony of his position by saying that his situation “should please all sadists” reading about it. Therefore, the features of the setting affected the reader by highlighting the negativity of his situation, which in turn drives him to continue pedaling.
2	In the essay “Do Not Exceed Speed Limit,” the features of the setting affected the cyclist in a few ways. One way it affected him was that the temperature was very hot and by it being hot outside his water wouldn’t stay cool. This is a problem because you need nice, cool, refreashing water to stay hydrated. Another way was when he hit a fork in the road. He didn’t know which way to go. All he saw was one ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a corral that couldn’t hold the lamest mule greeted me. The sight was troubling. Last but not least this water pump wasn’t working very well so he got down on his hands and knees and started pumping. The water wouldn’t cool down. He tried a drop or two and the water tasted like battery acid. Those are some features of the setting that affected the cyclist on his journey.
3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in several ways. First the rolling hills make it hard to pedal over the land. &quot;Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills,&quot; shows that the terrain was changing into a more difficult course. One long crippling hill,&quot; also shows how the hills had an effect on the cyclist. Another feature of the setting was the desert and the high temperatures. This caused the cyclist to become dehydrated. &quot;Trying to keep balance in my dehydrated state&quot; and &quot;I could drop from heatstroke&quot; show me how hot the cyclist was. One final feature that has on effect on the cyclist was the old abandoned factory. The sight of the boy with a refreshing glass of juice makes the cyclist lose hope and he doubts he will survive. &quot;I hung my head&quot; and &quot;abandoned factory of juices and dreams&quot; tell how the cyclist lost all hope at the sight of the building. All of these features of the setting have negative affects on the cyclist.
2	The setting of the area where the cyclist was biking effects him because it makes him weaker. Since the cyclist takes the long route, He is in the desert for a longer period of time. Being in extreme heat can cause a person to suffer from major dehydration. We know this was the case for the cyclist because he says, “…but not before I gathered up a few pebbles and stuck them in my mouth. I’d read once that sucking on stones helps take your mind off thirst…” This @CAPS1 is saying that the cyclist put stones in his mouth to get his mind off of how thirsty he was. I think this @CAPS1 is explaining exactly how dehydrated the cyclist actually was. If he was willing to put filthy stones in his mouth to help him get through his dehydration, he was pretty thirsty. Another thing that effected how thirsty the cyclist got was how hard he worked which was also a feature of the setting since during the end of his trip, he met rough terrain, he exerted more energy which made him sweat even more than he was. This made him @NUM1 more dehydrated. This story is explaining how the features of your environment can either make or break you.
3	There are several features of the setting which affect the cyclist one is the fact that he is traveling on a hot day in June. “and the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June.” The heat was getting to the cyclist and he was scared he might get heatstroke. The terrain was also not very ideal for a cyclist on a hot @DATE1. “I noticed the terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.” The cyclist was tired and the hills were making it worse. “The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips.” The cyclist was running out of water quickly and there was nowhere close to get more. These glitches in the setting affected the cyclist because it was extremely hot, he was running out of water and there was rough terrain. The setting was not in the cyclist's favor.
3	According to the essay “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit'' the features of the setting affect the cyclist a lot. One way the features of the setting affects the cyclist is that the mountains make the cyclist more tired. Especially because he no water, then having to go up and down hills really wears the cyclist out and causing him to lead into dehydration faster. The features of the setting affected him in that sense. Also the snake affected the cyclist. The snake caused the cyclist to be afraid which added to the fact that the cyclist was dehydrating. Another way that the features of the setting affected the cyclist was the Welch's Grape Juice Factory. The factory caused the cyclist to be even more thirsty and think about dehydration even more in the essay “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” the features of setting affect the cyclist a lot.
1	The fatures of the setting affects the cyclist because in the story the character makes it seem like horrible weather for example when he said “wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt” this is one way the setting affects the cyclist because it almost like your in the story and you can imagton what the character Is going through because everything is written in details.
7	Dear local newspaper, I believe that computers have a positive effect on people because it teaches hand-eye coordiantion. You can also learn about different people and places. But it also allows us to communicate with the people online. Computers have a positive effect on people because it teaches hand-eye coordination. Because it's rely important to have hand-eye. And when your out in the world you rely need to be able to look at something and pick it up or say if you get into a altercation with someone. So it's rely important to have hand-eye. Another reason why I feel computers have a posative effect on people is because you could learn about diffrent stuff over the internet. Like learning about far away places and people. So the internet is giving you a great opportunity to learn more about or earth, other than your back yard. So technacally it's preparing you for life. My final reason why I think the computer has a posotive effect on people is because it allows people to talk to other people who are online. Like say you dont have a phone but you have a computer and you need to tell something very important to someone; you could do it online. And people say it's one of the fastest pieces of technology known to mankind to people who need it. Those were my three reasons why I believe the computer has a posotive effect on people. And if you don't believe me go hop on a computer and see for yourself. You won't be dissapointed.
1	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because it makes it hard for him to get to “@CAPS1 National Park”. He took advice from some old men to take a shortcut to get him where he wanted to be. On his ride there, he stopped at a “town”, which was, to him, considered a ghost town. Then he got to a Welch’s Grape Juice Factory, but it was abandoned years earlier and he was becoming weak and dehydrated. He thought he would drop from a heatstroke. At the end of his ride, he reached a fish camp where he found water to drink. A man asked him where he was going and the cyclist told him. Then the man asked him, “Know the best way to get there?” The man was much older than the other old men that gave the cyclist advice. So the cyclist told the man “yes, sir: I own a very good map”. The man realized throughout the setting on his journey, that he would never accept advice from old-timers again.
1	In the essay “Do Not Exceed posted Speed Limit” the setting affected the cyclist sense of direction. The cyclist knew where he was going and how to get there but the old men told him their “short-cut.” It ruined his own sense of direction because he was taking out-dated directions from “old-timers that hadn’t left their porches since Carter was in office.” That is how the setting affected the cyclist in the's essay.
0	The features of the setting affected the cyclist a great deal. I say that because when there is peace and calmness then it motivates you more. Than when there is a lot en stuff around you.
1	Steep mountains, rolling roads, jagged rocks – are all reasons why the setting is affected towards the cyclist. Well the cyclist needs to know what is going on and what @MONTH1 happen. For example “Rough Rough: Do not exceed posted speed limit.” This setting lead to a lot of changes. So yes the setting does reveals a lot and I guess it describes how the cyclist @MONTH1 react to it also. So yes I think the settings do affect the cyclist through this whole story.
1	What l believe that the features of the setting affect the cyclist is that, “The old guys in the story remember things back how they used to be bot as they say in the book the world iso fluid place things change all the time. So for the cyclist to find his way he had to try and put together the the piece the old guys gave him.
1	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because you wouldn’t put the sitting in rain or he wouldn't be ride the bike. Anther one is you wouldn’t have a the sitting a city when there is nothing around but trees and rivers.
2	The features of the setting affect the cyclist is that on his way he had to deal with so many things. Like for ex he had trouble with the flat roads that was replaced by short, rolling hills. The next thing was there was a sign that was posted he could not ride @NUM1 he had to do @NUM2 and that made him disappointed. Then a large snake blocked the majority of the pavement in front of him. He became dehydrated. He became sad, hopless but still had energy to feel himself.
3	There are several features of the setting that greatly affect the cyclist. One feature is the desert he is biking through. The heat of a desert in June can easily dehydrate someone. When exposed for a long time, exercising, and running out of water, the effect is even greater. In addition, the change in terrain and road surface would have an effect on the cyclist. Traveling on a flat road requires much less effort then climbing hills. If the road is also rough, the biker has to work even harder to push the up the hill. There is also the mental effort of not tipping the bike on the uneven surface. Finally, there are not any buildings in sight. When someone is dehydrated but has no water, they are desperate to find some. However, if there is nothing they know of nearby, they will start to lose hope. Once they lose hope they won’t try as hard to keep going and they will lose some of their strength. Considering all of the things negatively affecting the cyclist, it is amazing that he managed to push through and reach a source of water. 
2	The setting in the short story “Rough road ahead: do not exceed posted speed limit” by Joe Kurmaskie is troubling to the cyclist “One ramshackleshed, several rusty pumps, and a corral that couldn’t hold in the tamest mule greeted me,” made him troubled that he was in the middle of nowhere. The quote, “Not two miles into this next section of the ride, I noticed the terrain changing, flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills,” shows that he was troubled by having to go over the hills. As you can see the setting was very influental to the cyclist.
1	I the essays the features of the setting affect the cyclist by giving him hope. The cyclist takes directions by a few old men on a porch. The directions seem incorrect at first. The remains of a Grape Juice factory make it seem like he will never find civilization.
10	Hello, I decided to write in to the paper on the topic of computers, and how they benefit society. Comuters are powerful machines, and can be used completing otherwise menial and boring tasks. They benefit people in many ways, like they are very useful in buissness, helpful in education, and connect friends and family together. Computers are uselful in buissness and are an extremely important tool in a common workplace today, and make work get done much more efficiently than if they didn't have computers. One reason Computers are so useful in the workplace is because computers can storee far more data that can be put on paper. Also, they can do jobs and processes very quickly, which is important in the workplace. They can also be used for sending important information quickly and without much trouble. These are all valid reasons comuters are beneficial in buissness, and help things get done. Computers are important today's schools and educational programs becasue they can help students work in a more efficient fashion. &quot;@PERCENT1 of all surveyed students said they would rather type a paper for school than write on by hand, and shows that they value them in their education.&quot; said @PERSON2, a professor at @ORGANIZATION1. This shows that Computers are important to students, and are used their benefit. In addition to students writing papers, computers are being used by teachers and school systems for grading, attendance records, and more. The teachers at my school are using @CAPS1 @CAPS2, pieces of hardware that are directly connected to computers, and can be used instead of white @CAPS2, and I see that students are getting more involved in class, and focused, because this computer technology is being used. All of these @CAPS3 are reasons computers are helpful in educational proceeses, and should continue to be used. Many people want to be able talk to there friends and family when they are bored, and because of computers and social networking websites, and instant messaging programs, this is made much easier. &quot;@PERCENT2 of teens have at least one sacial networking site they visit on a regular basis.&quot; said @PERSON1, a phycologist, who speciaizes in teens, This shows that people use these sites, and that they like them. Families that are separated because one @MONTH1 have moved out of the house recently might want to communicate with one another, and because of computers, they can. There are multiple ways that they could use their computers to keep in touch, like instant messaging systems mentioned before. Being able to communicate with one another makes theses people happy, and benefits society. Overall, being able to communicate through computers is an enjoyable thing for many people, and is important to society today. To conclude, computers contribute to society in ways that make it much better for everyone. Whether it's through helping buissnesses being more efficient, giving students the ability to work faster, and in a way they prefer, or if it's helping people stay in touch, computers are always benefiting society. These machines hardly ever slow people more thant manually doing the work would, and the positive influence they have far outweighs the bad they do.
10	Dear Local Newspaper, I am writing to you about the use of computers and how they are bad for society. With people getting less exercise, not enjoying nature, and having less interactions they are doing the world more bad than good. Almost everyone has a computer and it gets used more and more and it is just taking away a great time to go be active outside. First, exercise is a very important part of the day and it is happening less and less because kids are sitting infront of there computers all day long. There is so much talk these days how we are the fatest country. Well here is one of the main causes we have almost everyone stairing blankly into a computer screen instead of being active. Computers are a big problem and they cause laziness to occure more often than not because now if you miss your favorite @CAPS1.V. show just look online you will find it. Or if you are doing a project just look online and you will find more than enough information and it is just a click away.Second, enjoying nature is a scarse thing now. All you have to do is search online and you could find a picture of your front yard. there are much less people outside. Because who needs to go outside when you could be chatting with a friend or just being on @ORGANIZATION1 looking up new technology. People who are always on the computer don'@CAPS1 care about the enviorment as much because they are wasting electricity and they are more fun to internet on their place that they on. There are a lot less people going places now because who needs to go to @LOCATION1 when you can just look up pictures of @LOCATION1. It's taking away thrills poeple used to have of going places getting out of the house seeing parts of the world far away first hand instead of through computer. Third, there are for less interactions personaly between well everyone. Kids that text, @CAPS2, or facebook chat more then talk in person with friends are loosing talking skills of actually having a conversation. Because online you have time to think then when you talk in person you have nothing to say because you can'@CAPS1 think and your not to your full talking potential. People are seeing eachother less and less now that they can text and talk over the computer they think now have no need to see eachother now and it is ok just to talk through the internet. Friends &amp; family start to know who you are less because you can'@CAPS1 see emotion through a computer. Also, they say that you can learn more about someone in @NUM1 minutes of playing with them then in @NUM1 minutes of talking with them. With that being the case friends make friends now without even knowing that person with full understanding. Lastly, computers are doing more then good to everyone and they are becoming more and more unhealthy. With people getting less exercise, not enjoying nature as much and having less interactions people are just wasting their time infront of a computer screen getting fat rather then going outside with people and just passing a baseball. There are so many better ways people could spend their time than infront of a computer. Why don'@CAPS1 they see that?
2	The features of the setting around the cyclist affected him to the point of exauhstion and dehydration. The cycllist being exauhsted and dehydrated,or tired and thirsty, was beging to wear as the setting went from being flat to many ups and downs. The cyclist exlained the change by saying, “flat road was replaced by short rolling hills”(Kurmaskie @NUM1). The cyclist’s idea presented here is that he was to find new challenges when riding the hill of this californian desert rollar coaster. His water supply was thinning from the heat and the hills were tiring him beyond reason. All this cyclist could hope for was the blessing of a water refill and the shade of a puffy cloud.
1	The setting effected the cyclist severly. Biking in the desert following outdated directions nearly got him killed. He also came across several broken down factories and towns causing more dismay. However he came across a last stop that saved his life.
2	In the essay “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” the cyclistis affected by his surrounding. At first the man starts out at a reservoir camp ground. His confidence is high, and he is ready to continue his adventure. As the day went on and all he could find was abondoned buildings he began to worry a bit water running low he come upon “one ram shackled shed, several rusty pumps” no sign of life. He realiced that his trip was going to be rough. The environment and risk of death gave him the determination he needed to push forward. Although he was fearful of death from dehydration, he knew “travelling through the high deserts of California in June” his only chances of survival was to keep going. The mans surroundings were what had pushed him to keep biking until he found the fish camp. If he had not been so aware of his surroundings he might have given up, but not making it out of the desert to “the cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite” would be to devastating
1	The setting affects the rider because it is very hot wich makes him thirsty. how long the road witch affect his mind state and last the fact that ??? is in sight and that affect is coral
3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because they change the cyclist’s mood towards the rider. For example, in the essay “Rough Road Ahead;Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” it states, &quot;There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or sructure of any kind. I began breaking the ride clan into distances I could see on the horizon” The cyclist had to do this because they were having trouble riding since they were thirsty and the ride was very boring. This makes the ride seem larges so it also makes it harder to ride. Also in the essay it states, &quot;One ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps” This affeted the cyclist because after seeing this and later realizing he could’t drink the water, he was more thirsty since he was running out of water. When the cyclist notices the Welch‘s grape juice factory, he bacames determined to get there. In conclusion, the cyclist in the essay “Rough Road Ahead&quot; by Joe Kurmaskie, the cyclist mood towards the ride is strongly affected by the setting’s features.
1	The setting affected the cyclist in many ways. When he was going up hill it was harder for him to pedal. The hot summer day was breaking him down. He was getting dehydrated because he had a little bit of water left. It said he was trying to keep his balance in my dehydrated state. He felt like giving up.
1	Features of the cyclist affected the cyclist in many ways. One was the heat. For example, in paragraph @NUM1 it says, “I was travelling through the high deserts of California in June.” @CAPS1 that California is called, “the sunshine state”, I can infer that it was very hot. Another feature that affected the cyclist was when he thought he could get some water but it was hot and tasted like battery acid. This is said in. This is said in paragraph @NUM2. This is how features of the setting affected the cyclist.
1	The setting features affected the cyclist because it was a conflict. It was a conflict because it was hot and he was lost. I was a confict that he was hot because he had a limited amount of water. Which he could get anymoe of because he was lost. The heat causes people to get thirsty but he couldn't because he was limited in water.Another conflict was that he was lost. This was a conflict that because he needed to be some where.
1	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because he rode through the heat scorching desert of California, he rode over @NUM1 miles on bike to get to Yosemite, and he almost ran out of water on the journey. What kept him going on was the cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite.
3	There are many ways the cyclist is affected throughout the essay by the setting. As he first enters the “short cut” that the old men give him he is confidenc. When he arrives at the first town and sees that it is like a ghost town he does not fret but continues on his journey in confidence. As he got to the second stop his lack of water began to set in, “I got down on my hands and knees working the handle of the rusted water with all my strength. This shows he will work hard and is in need of water. As the cyclist past another place with no hope of water he placed stones in his mouth because he once heard it helped get your mind off thirst when he had just about lost hope from travelling through the hot @CAPS1 desert with no water he found one lost drive in him when he saw a store with water. Though this was a hot harsh setting it created inspiration for him to keep going and push through the hard times and survive.
9	Dear local newspaper, it has came to @CAPS2 attention that many people do not agree if computers have a beneficial or bad affect on those who use them. In @CAPS2 oppinion they are not beneficial. First when on the computer people have less time to exercise. Also, computers don't always have approprate sites. Finally, people have less time to interact with family and friends. I believe for these reasons that computers have bad affects on people. Without a doubt people who spend hours on the computer everyday have less time to excersice @NUM1 in every @NUM2 young adults are obiese. This is because most teens sit inside watching @CAPS1 or going on the internet instead of being active. Some students are so addicted to computers they never go outside! I understand that computers can be helpful to do school work but, kids who never get off can have life threatening weight problems in the future. As you know many web sites that are not appropriate for teenagers are accesible to them on the computer. Parents have to constantly worry what their child/children are doing just to make sure it is not bad. If less teens used computers as often as they do they would be lifting a nof their parents shoulders. I remember reading a newspaper article about a girl named @PERSON1 on a website chatting with a &quot;@NUM3 year old guy who later came and found her and turned out to be @NUM4. If kids were not so addicted to the computer than they wouldnt get into these websites. many teens spend there whole day on the computer leaving no time for their family and friends. For example when a friend calls and asks @CAPS2 brother to go skateboarding he says he is busy when he is just on facebook, @CAPS2 friend once said to me &quot;sorry I can't go to the pool today I am going to play rollercoaster tycoon.&quot; With this attitude toward outdoor activities I am not surprised that students wasting time on computers do not have time for family or friends. As you can see computers effect many people in a negative way. They prevent people from ecersising, expose kids to in approplate websites, and take away from valuable time with family and friends. I hope everyone agrees thet computer aren't beneficial to people.
2	The cyclist in Rough Road Ahead: Do not Exceed the Posted Speed Limit was greatly affected by the setting. There were no buildings or people to the town anywhere. This emptiness meant that there was no help from anyone and he could die with out anyone knowing. Also the setting seems to be very dry and have desert like conditions, without water the cyclist would be dehydrated and could suffer from a heat stroke. Also the setting seems to be very hot. The heartt also makes the cyclist physically dehydrated and mentally considers the logic of a heat stroke at the time.
3	The features of the setting had greatly impacted the cyclist. The heat, animals, and terrain had slowed him down throught his journey. The heat had slowed him down because he didn’t have enough water to keep his boby moving normaly, and he said he had slowed him down because he had to sneak around it so it wouldn’t bite him. The hills had affected the cyclist because it takes a lot of energy to go up there, when he said he couldn’t see anything in sight.
3	The arid, bare, and rough terrain of the desert affected the cyclist during his journey to Yosemite in the story “Rough road ahead: Do not exceed posted speed limit”. The cyclist’s expedition was hindered due to many obstacles. The dryness was a huge problem during his journey. “.I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June&quot; (Kurmaskie @NUM1). This exert explain the hot, arid climate of where he was cycling. This climate decreased the rate of travel the cyclist intended to exert. Since the cyclist was riding in the desert, there wasn’t many towns present. When the cyclist did approach a town, it was abandoned. “One ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a corral that couldn’t hold in the lamest mule greeted me” (@NUM2). After riding through the desert, the cyclist would have wanted a nice rest stop, but all of them were ghost towns. “Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills “(@NUM1). Cycling for hours in a hot desert with limited water wasn’t enough of a challenge; the flat land was replaced with hills. The cyclist is exhausted from all the other obstacles that the desert confronted him with; the rough terrain affected his journey since his rate was reduced. In conclusion, many factors negativly affected the cyclist expedition to Yosemite. The dry, bland, and hilly terrain of the desert hindered his journey
1	I belive the setting of an area can affect the mind when put is certin situations. In the reading the man is cycling and he sees no one, he is almost out of water and cant se a house or a person as far as he can see. This is scary and gives te feeling of helplessness but if he would be in @LOCATION1 and go past cars, people on the street and cars he would be calmer he could get water at only building along his ride the tempature would be cold there far he would drink less and go further. This would have changed his mood.
2	Well in the story Do Not Exceed Posted Speed limits by @PERSON1 the setting affects you because if you cant see any thing for miles and you are running out of water it has a sycological effect on you. You can start to panick like he did when it stoped in the old house and all that came out of the pump was battery acid. Also you don know exactly where you are so that also affects u because you don’t know where to go or if you should turn back or what. If I was this person the features around me would have a lot of effect on me. 
2	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. In the beginning of the essay she was happy that she was getting a shortcut &quot;I followed their device and launched out at first light along a “shortcut” that was to slice away hours from my ride to Yosemite National Park.” He thought he knew where he was going “I chuckled, checked my water supply, and moved on.&quot; When she entered the first town, “this sight was troubling”. I got down on my hands and knees, working the handle of the rusted water pump with all my strength, “she was beginning to get worried/ run out of water, the next town was “only eighteen miles down the road.&quot; He was now at the dehightrated state. “ The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips.&quot; Then he saw a building, but it was no longer open, so he got back on his bike, but his thoughts had changed he was now upset and expecting to die. He then saw a store, “Gary and wilbers fish camp”. He went in drank cool water and then on used his own map, rather than old guys.
2	There were many features of the setting that had affected the cyclist. One of the features was the lack of water. This had made the cyclist dehydrated and not think right. It had also made the cyclist have less energy. An example is, “I eased past, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state.” @CAPS1 feature is the heat. The heat had made the cyclist thirsty and sweaty. An example is “I wiped the sweat from my eyes to make sure it wasn’t a mirage…” @CAPS1 example is, “I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly, and I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June.” The features of the setting had affected the cyclist in many ways.
3	In the essay “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit”, there were many features of the setting that affected the cyclcist. The first feature that affected the cyclist was the desert terain, it very hot and there were no trees to provide shade. This affected the cyclist because he got very hot and thirsty. So he drank more water than usual. Secondly, he was running out of water because he was drinking more than usual so he had to conserve his water, which was making him became dehydrated. That all the towns we past through were ghost towns with no running fresh water, so this extremely dissapointed him, it also furthered his dehydration. Just when the cyclist was losing hope he found a small bait shop and got into the shade and finnaly got water to drink. So after all those dissapointments he found hope, in the small bait shop, which gave him the strength and mental boost to continue on with his journey to Yosemite national park.
3	The features of the setting made the cyclist’s journey even longer and more strenuous. The reason it being in such a remote area did not help. For example the people who still lived in that remote area were probably as old as the cyclist grandparents and the directions were horrible. Also, the fact that their were no new shops or areas or rest for the cyclist to go to; the water pump he found was old and nasty and the only building he saw was abandoned. Also ther factor was the rough terrain. It  being froit the cyclist was already very fatigued by lack of water and tiredness the terrain was long, bumpy and just horrible all together. Finally, the last factor was where he was bicycling in California on a @CAPS1 summer day and he being on a which had no n.c(but which bike does) did not help at all. These are how the features affect the cyclist journey.
2	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because the rougher the terrain got the more the cyclist had to strain to make it. For example, when the terrain turned to hills, the cyclist had to struggle to climb the hills which caused him to use more of his energy. Also, if the terrain was flat and smooth, the cyclist had less problems making the long journey. For instance, if the cyclist had less strain on him then he would not be as tired and would not drink as much water. In conclusion, that is how the features of the setting affect the cyclist.
10	Dear @CAPS1 in @CAPS2, Computers are one of the world's best discoveries today. For one, they help in our educational processes. They also help connect people from all over the world in little time and are a neccesity in science research. Overall, computers are the best thing that has ever happened to mankind. First and foremost our children today are already struggling in their educational systems. But with new computers they strive to meet every goal. Teachers cannot tell them everything but computers can, underneath that hard drive is a wealth of knowledge awaiting to be saked up by eager minds. Also, in todays world, waiting is almost non-existant. Learning to type gives these children better opportunities for success in later life. Family, say your child is out @NUM1 school day. Normally, they would miss their homework. But now, they can check it online and get back to their crucial studies when they are feeling better unless you want to risk tommorow's future workforce, computers are in essential tool for us, and our children. One of the best things a lot this world is that we're all different, connecting with each other helps us learn how to tell with each other and move forward as a society. Conneticing through the internet through programs like @ORGANIZATION1 is important for buissnesses as it helps them make decisions faster will ultimatly effect us. But don't be fooled. It can also befor pleasure, say @CAPS3'son &amp; buissness trip in @LOCATION1. No problem. Just go on webcam with him and you don't have to miss him anymore. In the government, problems evolve quickly, and steathily. To solve this, a president can quickly connect to his/her advisors while still being in his/her office. Connecting people through computers is maraculous, and important to life as we know it. In addition, we wouldn't be were we are in science if it wasn't for computers. First of all, we are making great strides with cancer research to day, than estatic common computer. If it wasn't for that, we might not even have kemotherapy. Lets face it, computers are faster then us; way faster. But this is a god thing, because faster proccesing means faster research. While a simple machine @MONTH1 not tell us the cure through its proccesing speed. It certainly brings us a lot closer to unraveling the mysteries certain diseases shold beneath. Two minds are better than one. Even a scientist can not know everything. But while connecting through a computer to scientists all over the world, they can analize research, and make very informed, responsible decisions. Certainly that will extend our life exsentency, and who doesn't want you've larger's some people say that people are too glued to their computer screens. But bear in mind, these are the people helping you stay alive, and helping lower your heathcare bill yoour talking about. So when you get ill and they find a cure, why don't you still compain that they only found it because they were attached to their keyboards and monitors! Trust them, they know what they are doing. So can we come to an agreement life? Computers only do good things, like enhance our youth's advention, connect our and help us find cures for the most malignant diseases and illnesses in the world. So help the world help you, and go promote the use of computers across your community. It will only further advance us as a society in the end.
1	he wouldn’t know he would be faceing while rider or the road @MONTH1 be something bad might happen to his bike or one of his bike’s wheels or he might fall of his the bick he would set so tired that he can’t go any more he might give it up
1	The setting sffects the cyclist by the need and comfort of riding down with no infrastructure around or people that most be the best mood nice and colun no cars and just him and the beautiful sky to ride with, like if there is infrastructure he must have to watch for people, cars and just have to day to streetsigns and act. So thats outing  the feature of the setting would affect the cyclsit.
3	In the adventures of the cyclist the setting is not only what developes the character but, that what affects how he pushes himself to not give up, even when he feels helpless. This is one example of how the cyclist is affected, &quot;I had been hitting my water bottles pretty reguarly and I was traveling through the high desert of California in June,&quot; With that information you can observe how this harsh setting creates problems for him physicaly because his body needs water. Which he is extremely limited and doesn't savor it very well. These issues create the problem of dehydration, and when mentally you think your going to die without water. You start to panic and lose control over yourself.
1	The features of the setting affected the cyclist. There were
3	In ''Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted speed Limit'' by Joe Kurmaskie, the features of the setting most the time disappoint him. You can tell that the features of the setting disappointed him because every time he got to a town he couldn’t get water. In the text it states, ''I got down on my hands &amp; knees working the handle of the rusty water pump a for like substance oozed out followed by @NUM1 degree brackish water that tasted like battery acid.’’ You know the setting disappoints him when he sees the terrain he has to cross as well. You can tell who he says ''At some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path a ridicuously large snake.'' The narrarator was disappointed that he listened to the directions of the elder rather than use his map. Joe Kurmaskie does a great job of making one narrarator faced &amp; how he felt about them.
1	The features of the setting affect the cyclist b/c the route, that the cyclist was taking there was a rough road him to travel. The cyclist took bad advice from some old men that hadn’t left off their porches for decades.  also, as he got into his long journey he began to notice what the advice the old men had given him was bad was bad advice, the cyclist was headed to Yosemite &amp; he had gotten some advice from ???(not legible onwards)
2	When the cyclist first set off, he was doing fine, he had plenty of water. As he kept going, and sort of got of cause, he began to come into the desert region. He was hot, and he was ruunning out of water. This was making him dehydrated. Also, seeing the tumbleweeds, and lack of vegetation probably made him even worse mentally, because he was maybe thinking he was never going to get free from that. When he saw the fish bate shop though, he was probably relieved that he was going to be saved,    
1	There are many ways that a cyclist will be affected and one of these are the setting. The setting affects them because if it is short smooth setting the ride will be easy. But if it is long bumpy rough roads it will be harder to control the bike which means that the cyclist’s job will be harden this is how a cyclist is affected by his or her settings.
2	The cyclist ran into rough settings on the way to @ORGANIZATION1 park. The first is the town he came to was a ghost town. Then he was running out of water when he ran by tambleweeds, and a large snake in front of him. He had no more water and there was rough roads ahead of him and he came across a juice factory. No one was there and he was out of water he did not know how longer it would be until he came tp another town. That is why I say that how the features of the setting affected the cyclist.
3	The features of the setting have a very negative effect on the cyclist. According to the old men the cyclist would pass by a few towns if he took the route they told him. But every town the cyclist came to was deserted. “There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind.” Because the towns were deserted, the cyclist water supply was dwindling because there was no place where he could get more water. He became dehydrated and kept pushing himself to find a place where there was fresh water. “Trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state.” Once he found some pebble and thought about sucking on them because it helps to slow down dehydration. But he didn’t because he thought he would choke on them. The setting around him also made him have negative thoughts. “It didn’t really matter. I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean.” Because the setting was a hot, deserted, desert it had a very negative effect on the cyclist. If he hadn’t been running out of water I don’t think that the effect of the setting would have been as bad. But because he did run out of water it made the effects much worse.
10	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I would like to notify your business that computers benefit society. Computers allow people to talk to friends and family, they are important resources for many jobs as well as school work, and they allow people to learn and store information. Computers are one of the biggest advances we have in technology. First and foremost, computers allow people to talk to friends and family. I like to go on the computer, mostly because I'm able to speak with my friends. Computers are a good way to talk to friends that you @MONTH1 not see often or just to talk at the appropriate time. I have a facebook and I always talk to my friends about events happining in school or school work. For instance, last month I sprained my ankle and I stayed home from school for one day. So I went on facebook at around @TIME1, when everyone was home from school and my friend told me what was for homework that night. So, now because of our computers I could catch up on the work that I missed that day of school. Also, if you have family that lives far away or someone in college you can send them an email to keep in touch. My cousin is in college right now and I always talk to him on the computer to see how he is doing. For example, we always talk about sports we are involved with during that time of year. As you can see, computers are a great way to keep in touch with family and talk to friends. Secondly, computers are a big part of many peoples lives because many jobs involve computers; as well as school. Computers are a very useful piece of technology because people use computers for paying bills, jobs and more. For example, my dad tests computer programs as a job. The programs are constructed, then corrected and revised, then finally sent out all over the world. If people weren't allowed to use computers then many people would lose their jobs and many families would be in huge debt. Also, children do a lot of school work on the computer. For example, I take spanish and I earn culture points for my class by answering a question on the computer. Studies show that over @PERCENT1 of children use computers for some sort of school work. Computers are a big part of the working society today. Finally, computers allow people to learn about different places around the world. The computer holds a lot of valuble information. There is facts and fasinating pictures about different countries. It also shows people around the world the culture, style, language and many more facts about places around the world. For instance, my uncle was on the computer one day and he was looking at places in @LOCATION1 and after a long hard thinking process him and his family moved there and they still live there to this day. Computers inspire people to learn and see different places and @MONTH1 lead them to something important one day. In conclusion, I feel very strongly about how positive computers are to society today. I know that you will feel the same way because computers have so much to offer.
1	The features of the setting affect the cyclist. One reason I say this is because he ran out of water and he could dehidrate. Also looking for water slowed him dsown more. Another reason I say this is because the man gave him the wrong directions, which got him lost and confused. That is how the setting affected the cyclist.
3	It is said that, &quot;experience is a good substitute for @CAPS1 instinct.” This means if someone knows how to deal with the environment they're in they can survive even if they weren't born with the animal instinct that come with the territory. However, even the most experienced person can be overcome by the extreme weather conditions they live in. In the essay, &quot;Rough Road Ahead,” by Joe Kurmaskie, the experienced cyclist decides to take a long, difficult, and dangerous trip. His ride will take him a long the long desert paths of California with a limited water supply. This is the major element that and him in the story. Because he listened to same old men he went without water for most of his trip. Between his constant excersise, extreme heat, and lack of water, dehydration hit him fast. A common side effect of dehydration is hallucination, which the cyclist knew. It says in the essay, “I wiped the sweat from my eyes to make sure it wasn`t mirage.” This represents his knowledge and experience in the matter, and showed that he was adapt to his environment through experience. A similar story to this is jack @LOCATION2's, “To @CAPS2 a fire” where the man is also pitted against extremes at nature through the vukor, but the elements still ovetook him. Both stories represents man's quest for adventure, and also the canstrant struggle for survival that people face. 
1	The feature of a setting can affect a cyclist energy. In the setting turns irds hills, it can every this Cyclist out.
1	The features of the setting affect the cyclist most on the fact that it strained him out the hydrated state. It made him unable to operate at his full power/efficiency. It deprived him of the little energy he had in him to begin with. That is how the setting affected him.
1	The setting affects the cyclist very strongly. The desert and heat with no water cause him to get dehydrated. The rolling hills and rough terrain tire him out. In the story it says “and growing realization that I could drop from heat stroke on a gorgeous day in June.” This shows that the heat and terrain could cause him to over heat and live a heat stroke.
2	The temperature of the place that the cyclist was riding through affected him very much. The temperature caused the cyclist to sweat. This affected him because he would get thirsty and eventually he ran out of water. For example in the text he says “the water bottle contained only a few tantalizing sips” and then it goes on to say, “I could drop from from a heat stroke.” This showed how it affected him because he thought he is going to drop from the heat.
1	Features of the setling affected the cyclist were the harsh &amp; hot climate and terrain. The author clearly wrote how “the sun was beating down on him and how he almost died from dehydration.
1	The features of the setting do affect the cyclist. If the road is rough you have to have the right bike. Then if you get a flat tire you have to know to look out for dangerous and posionous things. If you were in a real bad accident you’d have to be prepared just in case they don’t find you in time. You would have to know what nights were like. For example, if it got real cold at night you need to keep youself warm.
1	The desert and the hills had a huge effect on the cyclist. The desert in June must have been very hot and going up those hills had to be hard. The road was also very rough. It says, “Rough Road Ahead; Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit.” It also says, “I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June.” The cyclist was very thirsty because of the hot weather. I think the setting had a huge effect on the cyclist.
2	The cyclist’s condition was greatly influenced by his setting because he was lost in the high deserts of California in June. The heat crippiled him or he traveled in search of Yosemite. He became lost and ran out of water making his situation worse. Being lost in seemingly the middle of nowhere in the hot heat he became exausted, dehydrated and fearing heat stroke and loss of consicencess. This is shown in the essay by, &quot;the growing realization that could drop from heatstroke&quot; And, &quot;It looked like i was going to lose concisness for the last time.
8	@ORGANIZATION1, @PERCENT1 of people in the world use computers one time in their lives. Wether it's looking up information, sightseeing, or clothing with friends people are on the computer. They use their computers for work and games @CAPS1 children use the computer to learn. Some scientists suggest computers improve your hand-eye coordination, while others think it makes people smarter because they are seeing new things. You, @LOCATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 Newspaper staff, use a computer to type the news. You probally also use it for @CAPS3 of the things stated above. Most of the jobs in the world have one part that has to do with computers. Farmers @MONTH1 need to keep reports on their money income. Mechanics @MONTH1 use the computer to create blueprints, @CAPS2 officers use a computer to keep track of all the license plates. Baby sitters @MONTH1 need to do their homework. As you can see @CAPS3 jobs use the computer. How @CAPS3 people do you know that met someone or has a friend on the computer? I know I do, @CAPS3 people meet freinds on the computer. Ever heard of @ORGANIZATION2? they macth people together. There is @CAPS4, @CAPS5, @CAPS6, and @CAPS3 more sites were you can chat with freinds. All of these reasons come together and say the computer does benefit society. They help people in any number of ways. I agree we should spend more time outside but we should also spend some time inside.
1	How the features of the setting affected the cyclist in the story, “Do Not Exceed Posted Limit”, were very dangerous to his life. The cyclist was traveling to the Yosemite National Park on a hot @DATE1. The cyclist traveled miles after miles on his bike only to past by deserted towns, “This place might have been thriving little spot...a ghost town.” The terrain was threatening because after twenty two miles or so, the cyclist had to overcome, “short rolling hills”, which would use more energy and make his thirst for water even stronger. The cyclist was out of water and the hot day was not helping. After a grueling journey, the cyclist used all the strength he had to go to a local bait shop and drank from the sink after the trechorous environment he was exposed to. The features of the setting in the story, “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” were life threatening and almost killed the cyclist, due to lack of water and the terrain he overcome.
2	The features of the setting effect the cyclist by teasing him. First it was the rippling streams that taunted his thirst, then the old faucet and last the welches grape factory. The strraing were the beginning stage simply provoking thirst then came the faucet. The faucet made him relise that he was dehydrated. And last the abandoned welches grape juice factory had him almost abandon hope. The setting was effecting his mood.
2	The features of the setting affects the cyclist in the story. In the story, it says, “The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips. I could drop from a heatstroke.“ This statement clearly says that where the cyclist was riding, water was very hard to find and scare. He is talking about how he will die if he doesn’t get water. Another example is that there are no buildings around and is deserted with no one around and many hills and roads. In the story it says, “the terrain changing flat road was replaced by short rolling hills. This means that he was partially all by himself and he had no one to go to.
2	In this story, the features of the setting heavily affect the cyclist. Certain features portray that this “journey” to Yosemite National Park was dreadful, but at the same time enjoyable. &quot;I would come to along this breeze jaunt.&quot; The word breezy shows that the cyclist can enjoy riding the bike because there is a breeze. Another feature of the setting is very old and dirty. The water that the cyclist is drinking is drying his mouth out even more. “A tar-like substance oozed out followed by brackish water feeling.” This shows the dirtyness of the water. Also this setting shows the cyclist had to use all he had just to survive. It says “working the handle of the rusted water pump with all my strength.” @CAPS1, the features portray sacrifice and bravely of the cyclist.
3	In the essay “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” the setting greatly affects the cyclist. The setting around the cyclist led her to drink a lot of water because of the dry conditions. “I was traveling the hish deserts of California in June” This shows that most likely she was hot, sweaty, and a source of water was not near to her. The rough terrain also led to her using own strength to get up and down hills, and to get plants and animals. The settings in the story led the cyclist to become dehydrated and weak, she was forced on as low supply of water and dodge numerous hazards, with no sign of living people near her. “This place might have been a thrivins little spot at one time say, before the last world was&quot; This suggests a ghost town, where no people were currently living. There was nobody around her to help. The setting led to her deteriorating health. Her physical health was in danger because of her dehydration and her lack of energy. Her mind was also starting to ware. She had a shake her head to make sure what she was seeing in one part of the story.   
2	The features of the setting affects the cyclist. Because the man didn’t have a lot of water and he was go into the California deserts in June. Another reason is because the flat road was changed into rolling hills and up ahead there was a sign that said “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit.” the speed limit was @NUM1. One more thing is make sure you don’t listen to a gentleman that is old and hadn’t be off ther porch in decades. That is some of the things that can affect the cyclist.
3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist since it is affecting her condition. She needs water to survive, and the next town is very far away. So she could possibly pass out without brake, and the hot temperatures. “When I tried a draper I was, it had the flavor of battery acid” (Kurmaskie @NUM1). If she doesn’t find water soon, it will affect herb condition. Also, the features of the setting affects her determination. When she knows that she needs to find a town. she works harder. &quot;i would conserve my water go inward for an hour or so atleast or my inner spirit&quot;(@NUM1). She would try her hardest to make smart moves, and make it to a town, as fast as possible. She works harder since she knows without water, her life is in danger. Now, things could get even rougher.
1	During the cyclist journey in “Rough Road Ahead” by joe Kurmaskie he expierences setting changes such as the road being flat then going to short rolling hills. When hes wrideing he says the road is flat. “Flat road was replaced&quot; This tells us the road he was on was nice and flat. Then as hes rideing he notice the land change.” Flat road was replaced by, short rolling hills.” this tells us that the cyclist will have more trouble sence the terrain changed. That’s how the land changes  
3	The features affect the cyclist.The setting affects the cyclist because it’s real hot. So he takes a couple tips on some short cuts by some old men. Then come to find out these tips weren’t really short cuts. So now he’s riding and angry that he took their tips. Also he’s running out of water and becoming dehydrated. He sees an abonded place with water, but in order to get it you need to pump it. So he starts pumping and sees black gunk. He pumps for about @NUM1 to cool the water, but it doesn’t cool off. Come to find out the water tastes like battery acid. So he starts riding again. but encounters a snake. Luckily he gets away, but he feels that he’s about to die and regrets listening to men who haven’t got off their porch since @PERSON1 was president. What makes him more angry is that they seemed so sure. As as he's riding he sees a juice factory and goes there. Now it’s a fishing store and drinks lots and lots of water. He also says he’s never listening to old men and he’ll always use the map.
2	As the author of the story goes on her bike trip, the landscape around her becomes less and less welcoming. The first thing the cyclist encounters is a rusty pump &amp; old shed. When the cyclist tries to get water from the pump, she describes the water as very hot and not cooling down at all. When the cyclist continues, tumble weeds that look like “diamond head snakes” cross her path. She encounters no buildings for a long time when she does encounter a building, It is abandoned and suggests that people left because of the landscape. The cyclist encounters another elderly man in her journy but decides not to take his advice because of the path the last set of elderly men set her down. 
6	I think that computers have great affects on people. Computers are a good way to @CAPS1 intouch with people, @CAPS2 online, @CAPS3 jobs, and @CAPS3 information on @CAPS4 facts. Computers might not be good exercise @CAPS5 you but at helps you in life and it also keeps you organised @CAPS5 example it keeps files @CAPS5 buisneses and @CAPS5 people that are in the music industry computers makes beats @CAPS5 them and can also record @CAPS5 them. computers helps every one in all ages. It helps the younger kids in school where they have to write a @ORGANIZATION1 or have to do a project, and helps the elderly peope @CAPS5 their jobs. Computers alson helps you know what is going on in life, like on the veiws see who has been hurt or the weather. Truely the computers are realty good @CAPS5 every thing they help you do so and it is really amazing how technologie changes. If it werent @CAPS5 come veters I dont think some of us would be where we are today.
2	The features of the surrounding setting affect the cyclist from hi/her performance for example, In the essay “Rough Road Ahead. Do Not Exceed Posted SPeed Limit” the setting is full of hills, twisting, rising and desending. All of these things are working against the energy that the cyclist has. Also, the lack of the people in towns give the cyclist a hard and depriving time on finding a water supply so he/she does not dehydrate. Third the weather in the essay has a great deal of being affected on the cyclist it is hot in the desert of California and the cyclist has to be very hydrated to continue on his bike ride.  
1	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways, they ware heat, lack of water, and hills. While on his journey he almost gets dehydrated because he does not have a good supply of water and he said they taste “like battery acid.” And he had to convince up the road for anothe @NUM1 miles so that he could finally replenish himself
1	The features of the setting affect the cycleist by hurting his ability to keep going. In this story the cyclist was faced with many setbacks or problems. At first he took advice from very old man who had out of date directions. Then the cyclist thought he could keep going on a very limited water supply. The cyclist then was getting dehydrated and angry. The cyclist then found an old building which raised his hopes only to drop them once he found out it was closed and rundown. Finally he finds a store and then dehydrates and is on his way again.
1	I think features affect the cyclist because when you write a bycles you need to con
2	In the story “Rough Road Ahead: Do not Exceed Posted Speed Limit”, by Joe Kurmaskie, the cyclist has a very long journey that it’s affected by a variety of things, and problems. The cyclist is confident with himself at the beginning but after a few moments he feels really bad, and learns a really good lesson. “I eased past trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state.&quot; the cyclist shows that it is really hard for him to move without water. This quote shows that he is not only thirsty but dehydrated which is several for a human being. The cyclist also had a really bad time, because he had to taste stones in order to make his thirst go away, one example of that is when
3	In the essay, “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” a cyclist is confronted with a troubling setting on his journy to Yosemite. He is led away from the steady road as a result of taking mislead advice from an old group of individuals. In this essay the setting plays a crucial impact on the cyclist. In the essay, the author sets up the story describing the day as, “traveling through the high deserts of California in June.” Because of the amount of heat the cyclist was enduring, he became weary and dehydrated. Alone with this, the cyclist had to work much harder because the man noticed, “Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.” This setting is a major setback to the cyclist’s journy, and required him to persevere. In my life there have been numerous obstacles which I have had to persevere through. One of which had been when I was out camping, and suddenly, as in the essay, the setting changed, and a storm came. Though the other campers and I did what we needed to to make the best outof it. In the essay, the cyclist is affected greatly by the setting. This was the same in my experience as the setting affected myself. In both situations, perserverance led to a final satisfaction of the journey.
1	The features of the setting effect the cyclist because the roads are bumpy. The other things that is effecting the cyclist is the water on the roads. There are a lot of curved roads which always slows down his speed.
1	In the story the features of the setting affect the cyclist. The setting is described as a rough terrain, which makes it harder for the cyclist to travel. Also it’s hot, and there are no buildings or people around. This also makes it hard for the cyclist because he runs out of water. throught the story the cyclist keeps going and ends up sarving
1	The feature of the setting affect the cyclist because the surrounding is so negative. Everything around the cyclist is percieved negatively, so the naturally the cyclist feels like the task is harder and more challenging than it really is. For example, nothing is surrounding the cyclist but sand and the hot temperature since the setting is so empty and no one is around, then everything seems harder than it really is. Also the cyclist feels like he can’t go on and is weak because there is no living he around him. Furthermore, if the cyclist was in the park with the sun shining and people around and in sight, his attitude would change and everything would seem easier.
10	Dear the @ORGANIZATION1, @PERSON1 studied that @PERCENT1 of people believe computers have a positive effec on people. You can stay in touch with realtives. Also you can entertain you over long trips. Computers have positive effects on people. Computers let you stay in otuch with realtives keep up with friens and are a good of entertainment. If you have distant realtives you can keep in touch. Video chatting lets you see someone and talk to them practically face to face from thousands of miles away. If you are sad and need to talk to somebody you are a few clicks away from being cheered up. Also if you are in the army and have a @ORGANIZATION1 baby you can watch as they take their first steps or say their. Video chatting used only way to stay in touch but also you just talk even wihtout a computer. Aim and @CAPS1 let you see whats goign on with your friends that you might see everyday or once a year at @DATE2 camp. @CAPS1 lets you keep in touch with everything thats going on with things like status updates. Aim lets youtalk with just your keyboard whre you type messages to poeple. Mabey you want to go in to town with a friends just send them a message by @CAPS1 or aim. Computers a onley for staying in touch though you can stay while you travel around. COmputers let you do so much to stay entertained over long rides or even rides. If you want to watch a movie just put in a dise or even rent on off itunes or netflicks. If you want to listen to a song download it in seconds and listen to your. Also you can even play video games on your computer. Just buy the game install it and then play. Computers are a great thing during down time and have positive effects on people. Computers let you keep in touch with family stay up to date with friends and are an excelent source of entertainment long trips or downtime. Computers are the lightbulb of the @DATE1.
2	The fatures of the setting affected the cyclist by it hard for him to control hill bike down on rough road, hotter making him thisty and running out of water. Also there wasnt an building in sight so he could get anything to drink. Also he did know where he was go. These are the features that affected the cyclist
2	The setting affect the cyclist in many gruding and harsh was. First, the lack of civilization contributes to an uneasy feeling and an inability to refill his water bottle. Second, the heat and uphill bottles are taking their tollon both aplists physical and mental strength. Third, his water bottle is emptying at an alarming late due to his third and relentless heat. In paragraph four die exospodent cyclist reaches the first ''town.'' This place @MONTH1 have been a striving spell but on that morning it fit the traditional definition of ghost down.” @CAPS1 he came to house with a rusty water pump, which sped out brackish, near boiling water, which did not support the porched cyclist, physically, on mentally.
1	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because “never accept travel advice from
2	The setting of the story affects the cyclist in a negative way. He intrusted that these men he had asked directions from knew what they were talking about. With the directions in mind he traveled on his way to his destination. Only to find deserted towns, disowned factorys, and hills. With all this being the “high deserts of California in June.” With all these aspects the cycalrst was worn out and dehydrated saying “I’d read once that sucking on stones helps take your mind off thirst&quot; shaving his deep name of thirst. After finding a place to get a drink he stated “I had an overwhelming and buy some bait” showing his deep gratitude and relief of finding water.
1	In the story “Do not exceed posted speed limit&quot; The features of the setting affect the cyclist in a few ways. One way is that the harsh conditions of the desert make him need alot of water resources. This is because the heat and exercise will dehydrate him. This is evident in the story because after he drinks all his water, he is desperate enough to try to drink out of an old pump that had black sludge in it. This is how the features of the setting affected the cyclist.  
3	While trying to reach Yosemite by a shortcut, the cyclist faced many challenges and emotions. The cyclist started out his journey cheerfully with thoughts of the cool pines of Yosemite. “The sun was beginning to beat down, but I barely noticed it.” The cyclist continued on his spirits as well as her water supply going down. The cyclist encouraged himself to keep going, just to find an open building. “…telling myself that if I could make it that far, I’d be fine.” @CAPS1 many abandoned factories, the cyclist tried many methods to decrease his thirst including sucking on stones. “…slowly gaining elevation while losing hope.” @CAPS2 the cyclist found a deserted building, he lost more and more hope. When the cyclist found open store with modern bathrooms, he had “an overwhelming urge to seek out @PERSON1, kiss them, and buy some bait.” At the end the cyclist promised himself to always use his map.
2	In the essay, “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” by Kurmaskie, the cyclist went through hard times, trying to get to Yosemite National Park. A cyclist is someone who tried their bike mostly all the time to get somewhere. First off the cyclist asked old men for directions to get to Yosemite National Park. The cyclist knew that was a mistake in the first place, but he had hope that maybe they knew what they were talking about. Seccondly on his trip, he came accrossed an “Ghost town” with nothing in sight but a bike snake. The cyclist became dehydrated and was running out of water, the only water he
2	Well some features might have more than others and the cyclist might have more than others. Also the author faced alot of problems like the lack of water, the poisonous snakes and the condition of the road. So there were many thing that affected the author and the cyclist, when they were on there journey.
1	In the passage “Do not exceed posted speed limit,” there are many features from the setting that affected the cyclist. One feature that affected the cyclist was the snake he encountered on his way, for example in the text it says “At some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake”, “I cased post, tyring to keep my balance in my dehydrated state” This proves that the snake was a feature that affected the cyclist by giving him a point to stay calm even in the state he was in being dehydrated and all the affects he encountered from that.
2	There is many things that could have made his bycicle ride much more enjoyable, one thing is if he wasn’t in the middle of no where and if he actually knew where he was. For example, “There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind.” There, he had almost no water to get him through the day. For instance, “The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips.” @CAPS1, he did not know where he was going so it was harder for him. In conclusion these are some things that made his trip hard.
6	Dear Newspaper, I think that the effects are okay as long as we get off the computers and go outside and see some friends and get some exercise. Computers let us not just talk to each other but it also lets us challenge each other on games without hurting each other it could even stop all ways all at once because we could challenge other countries in war games without killing real living people. We can check our taxes and stocks. It also makes it easier to find health insurance, car insurance, and house insurance. We can look up historical facts on the computer. We can look up how to stop snake venom from getting to your heart and how to make a how and some arrows to hurt with. You can find plumbers, technicians, oil companies, and lumber companies. you can find dates on the computer, too and find information about certain eople too.
1	The feature of the setting do affect cyclist in such ways making him illusionalistic and dehydrated. He saw all idea that a juice factory was working, when it was abounded. He saw rusty pipes, this made him dehydrated because he knew those pipes could never produce water.
3	In the short story “Do not exceed posted speed limit” the settings of the story affect the cyclist. They make him think he will die and overall make him worried. In the story the cyclist takes two old men’s advice on the best way to get to Yosemite mountin and gets himself in the middle of nowhere. He finds himself in the California desert without water, he lets this go to his head. “I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean.” That line was from the last page of the story. The biker was taking an unfamiliar route and he let himself believe he would die. He knew he was in the desert without water the setting makes him nervous because he was in a desert. He wouldn’t have been nearly as nervous if he was in a forest where there are streams. He lets the desert and the heat convince that he is going to die. By coming across ghost towns he believes he will never see anothe person again, he gets oledrar because of where he is. He thinks the heat will kill him. The setting affects him and tricks him into believing he is going to die.
3	The feature of the setting including the conditions, weather, and amount of water can possibly decide the life or death of the cyclist. The conditions such as hills, and rocky roads can decied a future for a cyclist because if the rocky roads turn you off balance you could fall down a hill and give yourself an injury or possibly die. For example, in the short-story it says, “over one long crippling hill, a building came into view” This shows the conditions in which the cyclist had to deal with. In addition, the weather and amount os water can also decide the future. “The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips. Wide rings of sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke.” This shows us that if the cyclist gets dehydrated enough he could pass out and no one would find him in the desert. In addition, the heat isn’t helping him out any once he could die without anyone knowing. These reasons show us a cyclist needs to make sure they have enough water and the conditons and weather is right so they don’t make a life-threating choice.
2	When the cyclist is at his low point, he is an abandoned ghost town, looking for water that tastes like battery acid. The cyclist feels hopeless in the abandoned town. When he first reaches the water pump and the abandoned juice building he has a little hope only to be let down, because the building has no juice and the water pump’s water is too hot and the water is not any good. The setting is the reason his mood changes through out the story.
0	I am going to write a response that explains how the features of the setting affects the cyclist. In my response, I will include examples from the essay that support my conclusion. I think the features in the setting affect the cyclist because different things such as snow or rocks could affect the way someone rides.
3	In the begining of the story, a young cyclist sets out on a long journy to Yosemite national park. Along  his ride he meets some old but confident men. They tell him a new rout wich “was to slice away hours” from his ride the setting was excedingly hot @DATE1. He was supposed to encounter a few thriving towns along the way the first was a “baren ghost town” the next had water “the flavor of battery acid, then he came to an abanded welches grape juice factory. The author navigated through a very trying setting until he reached a baite shop. The advice that he gives to his readers is to stick to your guns &amp; don’t let old timers try and change your mind.
2	In the essay “Rough Road ahead” by Joe Kurmaskie, the cyclist had many changes due to the setting of what was around. The cyclist was lost in the dessert. This affected him a lot because the desert is very hot. He could have died from either dehydration or exhaustion. Also, in the desert some animals can be very dangerous on the cyclist journey, he saw a poisonous snake. It was a good thing that he was cautious around the snake because if he wouldn’t have been, he might have gotten bitten and there would be no one around to help him. The desert that he was in. also happened to be desserted and there was no one around to help him with the directions. The worst thing would have to be that he ran out of water. Without the water, he could become very weak and dehydrated.  and could have even died. The setting of where the cyclist was affected him greatly.
2	The features of the setting affect the cyclist by making him thirsty and him thinking he is lost and going to die. The cyclist got information from an old guy that has not been off his porch for years. Just when the cyclist thought he was lost he saw “Gary and Wilber’s fish camp-if you want bait for the big ones, were your best bet!” The cyclist went in and got water, and the old man asked him if he wanted to know where to go, but this time he said no.
2	In the short story “Do not exeed the speed limit” by Joe Kurmaskie, the setting has great impact on the cyclist. In the begining of the story he describes the scenery as &quot;@CAPS1&quot;. As he continued following the old mens out dated advice. It lead  him through more barren lands. When he came to the first &quot;town&quot; he described it as a ghost town. The second setting he arrived at was “One romshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a corral that couldnt hold in the lamest muic” he continued moving to the next town, which was @NUM1 away, he came to what he thought was a Welch's Grape juice factory and bootling plant. This tools a toll on his confidence because he said &quot;I hung my head&quot; he moved on and had finally arrived at un abandoned buiding called &quot;@PERSON2 and wilbers’s fish camp. &quot;This is where he drunk water and became repleshed. The setting had a great effect on the cyclist. Because depending on the location, decided weather he would live or die in the hot deserts of California.
1	One of the main things that affect the cyclists is the heat. Due to the heat he drinks all of his water. Another feature of the setting that effects the cyclist is the rough road since he is so tired he has a difficult time riding on the hills and other hard road conditions.
8	Dear local newspaper did you know that the average person spends @NUM1 hours and @NUM2 minutes a day on the computer? This is why I think that people are spending ton much time on computers. If people spent less time on computers they would exersice more, be outdoors more and spend more time with their family and freind. If people were to spend less time out computers than they would exersize more. With the growingproblem of obesity in @ORGANIZATION2 less time on computers would help this. Tests show that the less time spent on computers the more time spent exersizing. And with @PERCENT1 of @LOCATION1 obese this world help that problem alot. I once had a freind who would allways be outside exersie and playing. Then he got a @CAPS1 acount and he started to be home on the computer all day and would never be exersizing. Less time on computers would also time outdoors. Result from a I took at my school say tahat @PERCENT2 people would go outside if they couldn't use their computer. And it more people are outside will notice how nature is and @PERSON1 says that use of the electricity in a house. So if everyone of it have a effect on if to turn off their computers they would spent more time with friend and family. that there are to freinds and family on programs like @CAPS2, @CAPS1 and it is talking face to. And you could also do like to the and you see people. use @ORGANIZATION1 but you would need and it. I would be alot easyer and less it you would get of the computer and talk to them face to face. This is why I think that people are spending to much time on their computer and it is having a effect on their life. If they were off the computer they would spend more time exersizing, more time helping the environment and more time socializing with their family and friends. So please @LOCATION1 stop using the computer all the time.
3	In the story,” Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” written by the @CAPS1, the setting reflects how the cyclist is feeling. For example, “Flat roads was replaced by short, riding hills “@CAPS2 as the terrain was changing, so was his attitude. When he first started the journey, he was happy and care free and the land had no hills and he flat. However, once he notice that everything is not has the men said, he seems to grow a little angry and upset, @CAPS2 like the land seemed to reflect this soon he found himself in a bumby and unpleasant road. The setting also seemed to give the man more obstacles to overcome on adventure” tumbleweeds crossed my path a ridiculously large snake blocked the majority of the movement in front as me.” The land seemed to be leasing and tormenting him, when he started to figure out that listening to the old men was a mistake.    
2	In the story “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” by Joe Kurmaskie the features of the setting affects the cyclist by draining him of energy, he is sweating so much, he keeps on drinking his water and slowly finishes it and still has a long ride ahead of him. “The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips.”(Kurmaskie’s) since is was so hot the cyclist was thirsty and drank all of his water. It was a warm day and he needed to stay hydrated.
1	In the book ‘Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” by Joe Kurmaskie the setting was in codi, California. The author went on a journey
1	Throughout the riders long journey the setting greatly affected him. For example, the hot weather caused him to drink the majority of water suply making him dehydrated and tired. If the weather was cool he would have lasted much longer.
3	In this story the cyclest was affected physically and emotionally in many ways. One such way was the setting around him. For example, when he rode into the first town he gained of boost of confidence because he believed that he was on the right track to Yosemite. Then when the cyclist rode upon that old shed and the rusty water pumps he began to feel a little worried because he was running out of water and The Old Timers never mentioned the shed. When the cyclist encountered the rolling hills with tumbleweeds and snakes I believe he began to feel dismayed because he was lost. I believe this because in the text he says &quot;I was going to die and the birds would pick me dead.&quot; This shows how hopeless the man fealt. when he reached &quot;Gary and @CAPS1 fish camp&quot; he was relieved and thankfull because he no longer had death blazing towands him in the form of a yellow sun, empty spaces, and empty water bottle. This was how the the features and setting affects him in many ways.
3	Riding through beastly mountains, hot and burning deserts and no water. A cyclist was riding through a town and asked for directions. The two old men gave him the wrong directions and send him on a trip through hell that only a determined person could get through. First he had to go miles without water which resulted in him loosing faith becoming dehydrated and not continuing with his plans. The terrain he had to go through was unbearable and could almost kill him without water. Luckily he had faith and determined so he got through it and learned a lesion. Maps are made for people to use so if you have a map you should trust it and in the ending it shows that the cyclist learned that because he said “And I promised myself right then that I’d always stick to it in the future.”
1	In the short story “ Rough Road Ahead Do not exceed pusted speed limit.” A lot of things affeced cyclist. Such as the rocky road , and the lack of water for example where the author says “when I tried a drop or two, It had the flavor of battery acid.” this shows how has loosing lope, and he seems a little scared. Also the abandond towns  didn’t help.
2	All the features of the environment through which the cyclist is riding affect him greatly. First, since he is riding through the desert in June, that means that it is very hoy out and he will need plenty of water for his long bike ride. Also, the terrain of which he is riding is rough which causes him to lose energy. The sun was also beggining to heat down on him which means that he was going to have a hot ride to the town and which later caused his struggle for water. Overall, the hot, desert setting affects the cyclist. It causes him to dehydrate and have a need for water. In the story it says, “The water bottle contained only a few tantalizing sips” and that he could drop from a heatstroke on a beautiful day in June, This is basically showing that the hot environment caused him to drink a lot of water, and now he has run low which could cause him to have a heat stroke.
1	THE FEATURES OF THE SETTING AFFECT THE CYCLIST BY DEPLETING HIS WATER SUPPLY, AND ALMOST GIVING HIM HEAT EXHAUSTION. IN THE TEXT, HE SAYS: THE WATER BOTTLES CONTAINED ONLY A FEW TANTALIZING SIPS.” THIS HOTNES HE HAS LITTLE WATER LEFT FOR SURVIVAL UNTIL HE RUNS OUT.
2	The features of the setting affect the cyclist greatly. At first it was flat road which the speaker was happy with and he had “a smile on.” (@NUM1). Then came large rolling hills which created a challenge, the cyclist needed to muster up enough energy to continue. The rough terrain was next causing the cyclist to work even harder to cycle. As if the rough terrain wasn’t energy soaking enough, a snake blocked a majority of pavement and large elevations came into play. The harder the terrain, the harder for the cyclist.
7	Dear local newspaper, I think that computers are a great thing to have. For instance they are entertaining, they have communication, and they help make designs. My first reason is that computer are entertaning. I hate to go look at nature. But I love to play videogames on my computer. I still get my exercise though, because I go out and play basketball then play on my computer. The computers are still a good thing though because after @CAPS1 done with basketball, hanging out with friends, or if its raining I like to play some good old gun blasting computer games. My second reason is that you can comunicate with computers. I love to talk to my friends on facebook. You can just login and talk to anyone in the world. There is also video chat you can actually see someone who is talking to you from anywere. Plus email is great for work. You can send information from one computers to the other. My last reason is for designs every modern car that you drive, is originally from a computer. People get on these computers and make blue print designs to make cars. These are my reasons that computers are good.
1	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because depending on how the setting is, is how much skill they need. Like if their going down hill then they really only need to know how to control the bike. If their going up a mountain with lots of bumps they need to have some skill. Usually if their riding in a shady area then the wear clothes to keep them cool. But if their going to be in the sun the they need to wear light clothes. The setting affects the rider very much.
2	The setting in “Do not exceed posted speed limit affects the cyclist in many ways. The old men told the cyclist there were flat roads on the path he was to take, when the cyclist got there, there were hills not flat roads. The cyclist traveled through the desert to get to his destination. He started to run out of water because it was so hot and humid. He started to get dehydrated and could bairly keep his balance. In this story the cyclist had to pass a large snake “a ridiculously large&quot; snake – it realy didn’t look like a diamondback – blocked a majority of the pavement in front of me “(Kurmaskie). The snake was big and the cyclist had to work his best to pass it while wobbling from dehydration. The settings in this story had effect on the cyclist in many ways.
2	The features of the setting affect the cyclist for many readers after another. @CAPS1 are some examples why the cyclist was bike riding down a windy road. He is in a hot place similar to a desert. It is very hot there and is affecting him during his travels,&quot;I eased past, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state. Another thing that affected him because of the setting was that the desert had rocky roads and windy paths because he followed the old mans direction. &quot;Rough Road Ahead&quot; are final example is that he was in the desert so he saw a snake come out of the tumbleweeds.&quot; A large snake it really did look like a diamond back.&quot; @CAPS1 are three examples how the cyclist had been affected due to the setting of the story.   
2	The fetures in the settings like hills, make the cycleist use more energy, the more enegy that he uses the more water he will whant to drink. This is difficult because he states “The water bottle contained only a few tantalizing sips”. Therefore he was in trouble.
2	In the story the features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. For example he is in the desert and it is very hot outside. Also he is running out of water. This is bad because he could become dehydrated. Another example is when he comes upon the building he thinks it is a mirage at first because he’s pretty much dehydrated. The rough terrain also makes it hard for him to pedal and he is already weak from lack of water. In conclusion all these elements of the desert affect the cyclist in some way.
3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist’s mood towards the journey. At first, he is confident that the old men’s knowledge of the land is accurate and he is excited about what lies ahead for him. However, his excitement soon turned into dismay and slight doubt as his journey drags on. The heat of the weather and lack of water makes the cyclist develop an uncaring matter. “I’d read once that sucking on stones helps…with any luck I’d hit a bump and lodge one in my throat.” The verbal irony in this passage delivers a negative feeling to the reader and it is here that it is clear that the cyclist doesn’t care what happens to him. When he finally reaches a sign of civilization, the cyclist becomes himself again and decides that his knowledge is best.
2	In the story “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit while riding his bike the author Joe Kurmaskie has alongride. Where he is riding there is up and down hills also the road is very rough. He was running out of water in the desert. “I stopped at a rusted water pump to get water and a tar like substance oozed out.” @CAPS1 that he is off his bike he least worrie about the posionous snakes of the desert. He founded Welch’s grape juice factory but it was abandoned. The author found a bait shop and got water
1	In the short story “Do not @CAPS1 the Posted Speed Limit” by Joe Kurmaskie, the setting of the story affects the cyclist in many ways. In the story the cyclist experiences many changes in temperature and climate. He also experiences changes in land structure which makes it extremely hard to pedal and get where he needs to. From my reasoning is why the setting @MONTH1 affect the cyclist.
2	The hot sun and the desert features in the setting are affect the cyclist in ways that could potentially stop him from making it to his destination. The sun is beating down on him and is making it harder for him to reach his destination. “The sun was begining to beat down...wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt.” By him being so hot and tired fromthe sun, he thought that he would die from dehydration. This would very likely stop him from making it to his destination, Yosemite. His lack of water supply didn’t help the situation either because he could only go @NUM1, was “water depleting @NUM2.”
1	The features  of the   setting   does   affect the cyclist. For example, if it is hot outside then he would need more water than normal. Also if it was raining he would have to drive more careful. That is why the setting would affect the cyclist.
8	Dear The @ORGANIZATION1, &quot;@CAPS1, @CAPS1, @CAPS1&quot; goes the floor. &quot;@CAPS4 oh here comes pete.&quot; &quot;@CAPS5, is he getting fat&quot;. &quot;all he does is play on the computer all day long.&quot; @CAPS6 is on increasing amount or teenagers throught the @LOCATION1 who are playing on the computer too much. This is needs to stop. &quot;@CAPS7 playing on computers is one of the worst things that they can do with their time.&quot; @CAPS8 @PERSON1 of the international health committee. @CAPS6 are always going to be obesse people around the world but in the past @NUM1 years @LOCATION2 has doubled the amount of obese @CAPS7 in all of @LOCATION3.&quot; @CAPS9 show that over @PERCENT1 of the american population is obese and very much so. The future of american is all obese lazy @CAPS7 who only want to sit down in front of a screen all day. @PERCENT2 of @CAPS7 who don't experience nature at a young age never fully appreciate it. Since they play on the computers all day they don't ever use nature, they won't care for it and litter and pollute even more. Just @CAPS7 playing on the computer can be very bad for the environment like it is bad for themselves. Not only do the computers hurt the @CAPS7 and the environment it hurts the family and friend, @CAPS7 who are on the computer all day aren't spending enough time with their family and friends families are supposed to be close and they can't be if someone is playing on the computer all day. Just a couple of weeks ago @PERSON2 rayfield @CAPS8 that he got grounded because he was playing on the computer so much he didn't talk to his many in two weeks. @PERCENT3 of people who get divorced happen because of the arguements over the amount of time spent on the computer. &quot;@CAPS8 @PERSON3 from the yale marriage research center. If @CAPS7 knew that they might cause their parents to diverse they might stop playing on the computer so much. Therefore @CAPS7 shouldn't spend that amount of time on their computer because of the health, the environment, and their families. So its up to the people really, do you want a nice physically fit nation where every family is close or and rundown obese hole in the wall that is &quot;called&quot; the @LOCATION4
10	Dear Newspaper, The invention of the computer has made a great impact on society today. Although many people would look upon computers on a negative note, the computer allows us to do essential task needed in everyday life. Many people feel that the applications on a computer are @CAPS1 keeps us away from doing other productive activities, but the applications a computer holds is neccessary for must tasks. Apps suchn as  the calculater saves time from doing all the work on a piece of paper. It allows you to do simple or complex math in just less than @NUM1 seconds. Its a great for finding how much a tip is, financial reasons such as now much you have to save, or even dung same basic math or science homework. Another great application is note taking that can easily be typed. This application allows you to take notes by typing, which again eliminates the need to write with a pencil or a paper. Note taking on the computer can be used for easy to read notes to study from to get a good grade on an upcoming test or quiz. The most important and must commonly used application on a computer device is the internet. The internet has over millions of websites for many reasons. If you plan to go to the movies tonight, the internet will surely give you movie times, directions, and how long the movie will be. It is also a great way to plan family trip or to book flights and such. Considering this, the apps are very useful. The computer is also a great device to use for learning. It allows you to look online about new subjects such as far away places or people @CAPS1 would our country be line if we were not educated on the outside world around us? It is also a great learning technique for research. Our teachers today gives us many projects and assignments to learn about new things, and @CAPS1 a great way to research our topic than on the computer. The fashion of the @NUM2 and @DATE1 is just a project I did last month. The computer allowed me to find the garment both women and men wore, @CAPS1 material they were made from, and even now they managed to buy and get the material. The research from my computer gave me a great understanding on my topic and helped me to learned the basics of my topic. You would probably agree that communication can be used in negative ways, but communication is @CAPS1 keep our world spinning. The computer device is one of the many devices used for communication. Email on a computer allows you to send messages to a single or multiple people whatout the need of signal or service. Blogging is also a way of communication on a computer and gives you freedom to express your feeling on education on a certain topic. The instant message is probably the must used by teens. It is quick. It allows you to quickly talk a person without waiting, for reply for more than days. In conclusion, the computer is essential to our everyday life and without the computer, our people would not function!
2	The environment around people in certain situations can affect them in many ways. For instance if  you are hot, tree could be shade, or thirsty, a river neer by could help your thirst. If you were hungry and hot, but nothing was near you this could make you hot. In this cyclist case the environment affected him in many ways, from bumpy roads, “ghost towns, and trees. For example he said, “The sun was beginning to beat down, but I barley noticed,” this is because of the &quot;cool pines&quot; around him as he explains in the next paragraph. It also says in the text that the terrain changed and he even came upon a snake, which added to his thirst. So then making it harder for him to go one. From reading the the text on can see how features can have effects on a person.
3	The features of the setting stronger, effect the cyclist's journey to Yosemite. The features of the land;in, and hills, the fact that it is desert, and the setting in the middle of june also effect this story.The dry and hills land is a huge factor for the main character. Because if is hilly, he has to work twice as hard. The land is dry, so he his thirsty and has no where to get anything to drink.The land is also desert, so there is no where he can go for help or to get food, water, or civilization. He believes that he is not going to make it. The text explains in paragraph !!, &quot; the growing realization that i could drop from heatstroke on a goregous day on June simply because i listened to some gentlemen who hadn't been off their porch in decades, caused me to laugh&quot; The setting plays a huge role in the story. It is hot, dry, and deserted this out effects the main character and journey.
3	The cyclist in the essay Rough Road Ahead: do not exceed posted speed limit feels discouraged and dehydration because of the setting. Near the beginning, after viewing the first stop which consisted of a few broke buildings and some rusted pumps he states “This sight was troubleing,” He also feels dehydration when he reaches the pumps and finds the produce “A tar like substance oozed out, followed by blackish water”. Also as he is pedaling he sees a sign that says do not exceed 55 miles per hour. He
2	In this quick passage by Joe Kurmaskie, the many conditions  of the road and the area around it determine how he acts and what he feels, “ The  sun was beginning to beat down , “ (Kurmaskie) .He is starting to get tired ‘because ‘ it is becoming hot and sunny, so he is feeling less confident. He was traveling through the high deserts of California in June “. (Kurmaskie).Not only is he very tired and hot not where he is riding is barron and open and there is no one around him to give him help or to find water. Through the passage you can tell that the temperature and weather around the cycler can change how and why how he does. 
0	that   explains  for my features I’m the of the setting affect the cyclist. the   essay that support your conclusion is the cyclist .the features is the setting becaused the cyclist the Include the support for the conclusion.
0	The scenery makes the cyclist hapy. He’s sooooooooooooo happsy! Woohoo! happsy
1	In this story the setting has a affect to the cyclist trip and to him self. It being hot and over @NUM1 degrees and going down hill with a lot of turns. The cyclist is getting so hot that hes water is no longer cold. Being in this desert is killing and about to make him have a heartstoke. All the things in the desert is doing a lot affect to the cyclist.
3	The setting of a situation can affect a person both mentally and physically. This is evident in @PERSON1 “Do not Exceed Posted speed Limit.” The cyclist is unaffected, for the most part until the directions he was given by “a collection of old timers who haven’t left the confines of their porches since Carter was in office.” takes him over terrain not suitable for biking. Prior to following the men’s directions, the setting was enjoyable a made for an easy ride a reader knows this because the cyclist is confident. For example, he says “The sun was beginning to beat down, but I barely noticed it. The cool pines and rushing rivers of yosemite had my name written all over them.” This confidence begins to depleat as the cycling gets harder. For example, the cyclist says “sometimes life can feel so cruel.” after he hits rolling hills and a sign warning of rough road and not exceeding the speed limit. The cyclist became disappointed and wanted to give up because he couldn’t even reach that limit. However, he’s determined and pushes through to reach a shop. This gives a sense of satisfaction and confidence. So in conclusion setting can have a powerful affect on mood or motivation.
2	The features of the setting affect the cyclist by making him ???  are ??? like when he rood through that ghost town. The setting is a big part of this story thats all that talk about. And when hes getting water or how the tumbleweeds are crossing the road. He was all ways thirsty and rode his bike along ways and is no paint in ??? ??? ???.
3	How the setting changes the mood of the cyclist is that what he sees pretty much discribes how he feels. Like he starts off with strong less and a smile on his face. Then he comes to the first town which was a ghost town, that didn't really dampen his spirits because when he sees it he laughs. Also when the setting changes so does his confidence in the old men's direction giving. Like at the first town he still has confidence in what they told him. Then he notices that it starting to get hotter but that doesn’t change his mood much. @NUM1 miles later comes top a fork in road with rusty water pumps and a ran down car all that makes him less confidence in water level. Then he realizes the next town is a long way away so he losse more confidence and gets more worried about water. Then the flat road is replaced with rough road so his mood goes down more. Then at last he goes to a fishing store and so he gets water and his spirits go way up. Here is how the setting affected his mood.
8	Dear Readers, I believe that Computers do good in our country and have a positive affect too people. This is because it saves paper sending emails and you save money too, also you can learn new things about different countrys like @LOCATION1, and lastly you can iteract with people you know and talk to them and use technowlogy to your advantage. These are a few reasons why computers have positive affect on society and the wayore live. First off computers help save the environment and they do this by leting us not cut down trees and make paper out of them. Do you know how many trees are cut down a day around @NUM1 trees and they are all not imeditly taken to the mills to be turned into paper. But thet stopin piles at loging sites and are leftrotting there not be my put to good work or what they should be. I feel that trees have feelings like us but can't talk with out a mouth. So when you cut down a tree its like robing. Using computers we save trees and stop all that from happening. She one reason why think computers are a positive impact on love and society. Secondly learning you can learn a lot on a computer all you have to do is look for it. I learn many things each day at school because of the help of computers and I feel that is computers are use it can excellour learning and @MONTH1 been a lot more in a lot shorter time then we would have my to find a book or the subject what youre looking for. Computers have made things a lot impact on children but we all new things I when we use computers. So computers are a good thing and a bad thing. Finaly you can talk and interact with friends. techknowlogy has advanced so much that we don't see the world in prospective like take a cell phone for example what do you see mostly likly a phone. But if you open it up what to do you find? You will find a micro computer thats capable of surfing inter playing music just smaller size then before. computers revolutronized the way we look at the world and techknowlogy we can talk and play games usiing this techknowlogy most of what we see every day used with techknowlogy hike, a game station or even a car rardo. adn all of it is used to help using ract with one on toher. So I veiw techknowlygy a so good thing. In conclusion techknowlogy has a positive and negative impact by more positive than negative influence. Techknowlogy help us in our everyday lives and helps save the environment by letting us talk and save paper just by button. Techknowlogy has revolunoized the wat mankind lives and how they veiw society but it us all a good thing in the end. And so I concluded that techknowlogy/computers have a positive and negative impact on socuoty.
2	The features and setting in the story affected the cyclist because they made his journey to Yosemite even harder. In the story it says that it was so hot he could drop dead from heatstroke. Also his lack of water made him extreamly tired as he petaled. Next the sun was beating down so not only was he tired due to his lack of water but also because of it being so hot out he was loosing water and energy from his sweat. Thats why the features and setting made his journey to YoSemite difficult.
1	In the short story, “Do not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” The cyclist experiences some difficult times. When starting the journey he had very little water. Because it was hot and dry his water went quickly leaving him very little water for the rest of the trip. The ragh roads also made him, tired making it harder to make the journey.
2	Features of the setting that affect the cyclist are “the cool pines and rushing rivers” they affect the cyclist by keeping him cool and energized by the senery and the temperature, another is the juice factory and it was old and shut down showing that he would die alone. The goast town which was completely and utterly desserted showing that the place is barren and unlivible these are some of the features the affect the biker.
2	The cyclist is very discouraged by the dry and hot settings around him. A feature is something specific about some thing else. In ‘Rough Road Ahead. Do not exceed posted speed limit the cyclist takes the advice of a few old men that seems to be somewhat outdated, and gets him lost as he is running out of water and energy. The cyclist says “Over one long, crppling hill, a building came into view. I wiped the sweat from my eyes to make sure it wasn’t a mirage” (Kurmaskie @NUM1). He is greatly affected by the heat and was so tired he wanted to make sure the building was not an illusion. Also, the changed terrain affected how much water he drank and how hard he had worked just to get up that one long hill. The dry climate and tough terrain greatly affected the cyclist.
2	Heat, dessert, humidity – all are things that affect the cyclist as on his journey. First, heat because the heat is making him thirsty for water @CAPS1 he is running row on. For example, the narrator describes, “… water bottles only had a few tantalizing sips.” This means that the day is hot and running out of water. Second, dessert because the narrator is the only one around and deserts are usually diserted. For example the narrator exclaims “There was no one in sight, not a building, car, structure of any kind.” @CAPS1 clearly states that he could be in a dessert where no one wants to be. Lastly, humidity, because it can be hot but then the humidity comes into plan and makes the sky more dry and seen hotter than it usually is. This is why heat, dessert, and humidity all are things that affect the cyclist as he is on a journey.
3	The features of the setting greatly affect this cyclist. At first he is fine riding along the old-timers “shortcut” as he states that “things began well enough. I rode into the morning with strong legs and a smile on my face.” But what he didn’t know was this was the beginning of a very rough day. He arrived at the first “town” which was a ghost town. He wasn’t overly worried yet but at about sixty miles in on his journey he came to a ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a broken down corral. The cyclist explains how he had drank a lot of his water and was in need of some. He tried the pumps but he explains how “a far like substance oozed out, followed by brackish water feeling somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees.” A couple miles later he came to a highway sign that read ROUGH ROAD AHEAD: DO NOT EXCEED POSTED SPEED LIMIT. The cyclist continued on desperate for water. He even came across a snake. He was now fearing a heat stroke. He came to an abandoned grape juice factory and hung his head. The cyclist then was almost completely dehydrated from the long, tiring bike rid. The cyclist was sure he was going to die from dehydration or a heatstroke that this terrible ride had caused. He finally came to a shop a drank from the sink. So this ride was torturous due to the setting.
1	The features of the setting affected the cyclist in positive and negative ways. At first, there were the two old men who gave the cyclist the out-of-date information. They affected him negatively because if it wasn’t for them, the cyclist would have never gotten lost. When the cyclist arrived at the first town, the water pump affected him, the cyclist was running out of water and the water from the water pump tasted like battery acid and was about @NUM1°. The cyclist was becoming more and more dehydrated and the small, rolling hills didn’t help his dehydration, he also used a lot of energy in order to go over the hills. Finally, he found Gary and Wilber’s fish camp where he was able to get water. This whole experience in a way, affected the cyclist positively even though, at the time, he was affected negatively. The cyclist learned to not take advice from really old people who “haven’t left the confines of their porches since Carter was in office.” The cyclist was affected positively and negatively by the features of the setting.
2	In the essay “Rough Road Ahead: Do not exceed posted speed limit” the cyclist is on a journey to Yosemite National Park and stops for advice on a quicker route. When he asks the old men he says, “Never accept travel advice from a collection of old-timers who haven’t left the confines of their porches since carter was in office.” Along with using their advice he faces abandoned ghost towns that they said were thriving spots. The cyclist overcomes the rolling hills of terrain and mirages and the heat of a day in June in the California in deserts. Finally he sees bait and tack shop and when he sees that the men who own the place are older than the other guys he just stares at them in all. Based on the quote you can infer that the cyclist will ignore their advice about having the best map. 
1	The features in the setting affect cyclist in many ways. One of which is bring only to carry so much equipment which @MONTH1 be needed. For example, you can only take so much water with you and once you run out of there are no buildings or anything around that you are out of luck. Also, you can only take so much food. Finally, when you are ready to go to sleep you can’t just pull over you have to ride until you find a hotel or get home. I know that I would not make it. So those are just a few reasons on why the setting affects cyclist.
3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist by making him dehydrated, troubled, and relieved. The cyclist is dehydrated because of the horrible heat. He says “the growing realie at von that l would drop from heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June.” This means that the heat is a treat to him and would cause him to become dehydrated and have heatstroke. The cyclist is troubled by the scarce sourroundings. &quot;a corral that couldn’t hold the lamest mule.” He is getting worried because there is no one around and his directions are starting to sound wrong. The cyclist is relieved by the water from the sink. He had the “overwhelming urge to seek out Gary and Wilber, kiss them.” This means that that he is so relieved that he has finally found water and he wants to thanks the owners of the bait shop for providing it.
9	Dear @CAPS1, I do not think people use the computer to much. I think this because some use them for work, some use them for school, and some use it to talk to family or friends that are not so close to them. Firstly, most buinesses need computers to keep the buisnesses up and running. Like were my mom works she needs the computer for pay roll, inventory, e-mailing the works about jobs, and to look up companies to supply concrete, stone, tricks, etc. Buisness people have excuses to have to use computers all the time. Most buisness people also use computers to plan buisness trips. Secondly, kids in school use computers to do homework, class work, research for projects, or to go and study island and education. Some kids can choose to use the computers improperly but at the same time interesting. Like how cells divide into smaller cells how body systems work or how a girl or boy is made from embrio to birth. In addition, most people use computers. Like @CAPS2 people use @CAPS2 to talk to on the other side of the world or you can use aim. I have both cell phone to call and text people that live far away. I use aim to talk to all my friends, I use to face with. So, don't say all people are on the computer to much and for the wrong reasons, because that is not true at all. Finally, altho all people are always on the computer it is must likely to talk to friends you haven't seen in a while or for work issues, and for school related work. In my opinion all people will always use the computer because it is the way of life now a days. So, I don't think there are any affects on anyone because we all use it to our benifits.
2	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in the story “Rough Road Ahead” by Joe Kurmaskie. The downhill land format helped him in a way because he wouldn’t have to use strength and pedal as hard without having as much water in his body. When he came to a pump, it was rusty with tar oozing out followed by hot brackish water flavored like battery acid. The dryness of the dessert had a bad affect on the cyclist because he wasn’t able to get to the Yosemite water until the end. The breeze of the wind had a positive affect because it helped to cool him down. The features of the setting in the story “Rough Road Ahead” by Joe Kurmaskie affect the cyclist.
2	Many things that involve settings can affect other things. In the “Do not exceed the posted speed limit” by Joe Kurmaskie, a cyclist is affected by the setting as he travels to Yosemite National park. “The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips. Wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that I could drop from a heatstroke on a gorgeous day….” (kurmaskie @NUM1). The sertting from the day is affecting him very much and it is hard for him to continue. He is very tired and almost sick from the heat. The settings of this place are hurting to the cycleist and he wants to go home and away from the heat. The setting of this place effects the cyclist very much.
1	The features of the setting affect the cyclist. One way that the features affect the cyclist, is that it is summer time, and it harder for the cyclist because
1	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. One way could be if the setting was in, like, a place with a lot of water, then the cyclist wouldn’t have to worry about dehydration. Another reason would be if the old men were never outside in the first place, then none of this would have also happened.   
1	The features of the setting affect the cyclist physically. The want of the California desert canes the cyclist to became tired and dehydrated. For example the another states “I cased past, trying to keep my balance dehydrated star,” The setting is the main factory which causes the cyclist to become dehydrated.
1	One part of the setting that is affecting him is the sun, which is mercilessly overheating the biker. Another problem is the terrain he is on, which is a number of small hills is wearing him out. There are also apparently no trees for shade and no clouds or wind to cool him off.
2	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because as the terrain got rougher things to the cyclist got harder. In paragraph @NUM1; there is a senteance that says, “It read: Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit.” In the next paragraph the cyclist comments, “sometimes life can feel so cruel.” @CAPS1 because the road ahead got rough to the cyclist life was cruel. All the features like the snake, lack of water and rolling hills are all obsticules in life, people have to experience. We might not like it but the reward at the end is wonderful.
2	The features of the setting that affect the cyclist are the conditions of the road and weather. he hit some bad and nasty water. along with other hazardous things, he also tried to ride through a desert where he had already drank all his bottles of water and had nothing left to drink, he was very dehydrated and had to drink nesles water. It was hard for him to keep going, being dehydrated so bad but he had to. at one point a big snake almost took up the entire road and he had to just ease his way on by it, his riding conditions were so bad, he thought he was going to die, he said the birds were going to eat him. The weather was so hot it was hard to go on, he finally found a bathroom, went inside it drank water from the sink and yellced to a man that told him the direction he wanted
1	The features of the setting do indeed affect the cyclist. First in the story when describing the setting it says “there was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind.” @CAPS1 basically giving a hint or foreshadow that something bad is going to happen because hes alone. Another description of the setting when it affects the cyclist when it says “Rough Road Ahead; Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” @CAPS1 pretty much saying danger ahead, something bad will happen.
1	The setting affect the cyclist in many ways. How because there was not a posted speed limit up there cause the cyclist went right throw and over goin faster then he was suppored to.
8	Honestly, I totally and absolutely believe that child internet use should be cut down in the @LOCATION2, because of many reasons. And here are just a few of them. First of all, the internet can make people very obese, for example, if your friend was going to a walk to your house, but then decided to @CAPS1 you instead, he is probably not getting a lot of exercise. As a matter of fact, the leading @CAPS2 in @LOCATION1 is no longer cigarettes. It's obesity. Actually @NUM1 @CAPS3 are obese, with that number still rising. Another reason why internet use should be cut down because bullies, hacker, and terrorists. Because. And the some I believe that child in the @LOCATION2
2	Poisonous snakes, mirages, rolling hills, and dry dead tumbleweed these features in the setting that the cyclist was going through have the greatest effect of all. They showed the trecherous path he took the obstacles he had to surpass the prevail. The purpose of including some features of the setting like the poisonous snakes, mirages, rolling hills, no signs of life, and no water all show and impact how bad the conditions were. If it left out these sectives the audience could say/think he was traveling through any old trail, for all they know the cyclist could be traveling along a windy river passing threw nice developed towns, so you see the features in the setting help set the mood and also reveal the confident of the story.
0	When you do something really to often you get used to it, well I think is the same thing with how sitting affects the cyclist features. It might make their butt flat or their back has a diferent shape and with different shep I dont mean that they are diformed but evey person is diferen so their back can either have a “@CAPS1” shape or an “I” shape or a “D” shape.
3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in these ways. The cyclist was very hot. “wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt and the growing realization that I could drop from heartsroke on a gorgeous day in June.” The towns that passed through that were supposed to have people were in fact deserted. His ride ended up being even harder than it would have been. This is how the features of the setting affect the cyclist.
2	There are many features of the setting that would affect the pedalists. “Flat road was replaced by short rolling hills “(kurmaskie @NUM1) shows the change of terrain. Hills must be traveled up to get to the other side and that takes much time and eneegy, especially for bike riders. “high deserats of California in June “(kurmaskie @NUM1) shows heat. Heat makes it harder for most people to concentrate and causes people to heat overheated when exerting much force at once. These two co
1	The different settings of the cyclist affected him by how he felt when he rode the bike on the rode. He was well excited and happy that he is going on the ride and how he truly felt about how he rode the bike real fast through the short cut. And how he came over a long, crippling hill he was riding real fast. So unfortunately he was riding fast non stop and how he came through the whole road with relief. He felt so free and how he when he came over hills that are tall and large. But he mostly believed he could find his way at the end. He said it himself he always stuck in the future. So he’s keeping his future and his wisdom to himself. He thought he was gonna die but all he had to do is ask for a little push. But different things did affect the cyclist by doing the impossible of his very bright future.
3	One of the biggest problems that the author faced in his essay was his surroundings. The setting of the story in Yosemite provided many obstacles such as the vastness of the park, the summer heat, and the fact that many places had been abandoned. The summer heat was the biggest problem for the cyclist. He had to bike many miles, but he only had limited supply of water. Eventually, his water supply began to run low, which increased his determination to find the next town before he collapsed. It is this determination which moves him from ghost town to ghost town and keeps the story moving. Another big problem was the vastness of Yosemite National Park, which he was biking through. Any wrong turns (which he took, thanks to the direction he was given) could get him lost and thrown off track for a very long time. It was his confusion as to where the next time was that kept him biking, with difficulty and made for an interesting story. An example of the vastness of the park was when he quote, “About forty miles into the pedal, I arrived at the first ‘town.’ This place might have been a thriving spot at one time-say, before the last world war-but on that morning it fit the traditional definition of a ghost town.” This quote shows that even after many miles, he hadn’t seen a sign of anyone living, which would have increased his desperation to keep looking for civilization.
3	In ''Do Not Exceed Speed Limit,'' by Joe Kurmaskie, the author depicts the vivid details of the setting and how they contribute to the cyclist’s condition. For example, the author wrote “Over one long, crippling hill, a building come into view. I wiped the sweat from my eye” The way the author described the hill as “crippling” should how much energy it was taking away from the cyclist. Another quote that contributed to the cyclist’s journey was, “that smoky blues tune ''Summer time” rattled around in the dry honeycombs of my deteriorating brain.” This expressed how dehydrated the summer heat way making him. I believe the author used modifying details to support the description of the cyclist’s condition. I think the description of the setting enhanced the reader’s perception of the cyclist’s journey.   
2	The terrain the cyclist faces don’t help very mach considering he is almost out of water, he came across hills that ticed himout a lot &amp; made him even more thirsty. Also, when we came across the juice factory he used a lot of energy to get there because he was excited and that made him even more thirsty. Therefore if he didn’t have any energy left after all of that he wouldn’t have been able to get to the baits shop.
1	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. First of all he is in the middle of no where, and he doesn’t know the direction of where he is going, and he also doesn’t know the people who live there. The other thing is that he doesn’t have a food, or a drink, so without eating or drinking he can’t get energy, so he can’t ride the bike.
2	The features in the setting in the story afects the cyclist in many ways. For example in the story it said, ”At same point, tumple weed crossed my path.” This is saying that he is in the desert or somewhere very hot because I know that you usually only see tumple weeds in very hot places. Thus, being in the desert affect the cyclist because he is already low on water then being  in a place as hot as the desert made him get even nor dehydrated. Another feature in the setting in this story that affected the cyclest is the hills he had to climb. This affected him because he was already  dehydrated and climbing hills made him have to work more which caused him to lose more sweat and become even more dehydrated. Those are two examples of how the features in the setting of this story affected the cyclest.
10	Dear newspaper, This year my school and a cop come into my school and tell me and my peers about the dangers of online. This has made me believe that computors are not beneficial. Computors are not beneficial because they enforce bad habits. Plus, websites and some applications are dangerous. Also, they are very addictive. Computors have a bad effect on people. To begin, computors enforce bad habits. For example, some websites are bad websites that say mean things about other people. Some kids @MONTH1 join in on the cyber bulling because other kids are kids @MONTH1 give in to peer pressure because they want to get accepted by their peers so badly. Furthermore, someone @MONTH1 agree to meet someone they don't know. That can be scary because you do not know if this person is really someone you thought they were. Recently, I read a magazine and it had an article in it about people going to meet other people they online. Most people found at that it was not the person they thought they were. Finally, the computor enforces bad habits because people @MONTH1 send someone some questionable pictures to someone else. As I mentioned before, when the police officer came to our school he talked about this. He said that people were sending pictures of them that were innapropiate to other people. Those other people would send it around and in the end it was a horrible mess. I'm sure if computers didn't have a giant effect on people, this would not be as big of a problem as it is. Computors do not only cause bad habits, but they are also dangerous. I'm sure if you listen to the news you will hear stories about child predators. I think that is one huge problem. If computers did not have such a on people this would not be a problem. In addition, computors are dangerous because kids @MONTH1 choose to make bad decisions because they do not knew. For example, many kids who are on myspace or facebook have not talked to their parent or guardian about internet safety. Or maybe even their parent or guardian isn't monitering them to make sure they are safe online. In conclusion, the computer is dangerous because feelings could be hurt because of myspace, facebook, a blog, a video, or maybe even more. As an illustration, one time one the news I heard a story about a girl who was tensed on the internet. She felt so bad that she committed sucide. I found that horrible. A person should never comitt sucide, especially because some other person could not be nice. To sum up, computors are very dangerous. Computors are also addictive. To start off, it makes you spend less time with your family. (not finished!!!)
2	The setting in this story is very hard for the cyclist. His main problem is the lack of water. If you deprive the body of water all of your major organs will bake in the hot sun. Another problem was the condition of the terrain. It is very hard to cycle on bumpy dry land. These are any a few problems the cyclist encountered.
1	The feature in the setting affeted the cyclist alot. It was a hot summer day and he was running out of water. With oll the heat he could have had a heat stroke. Another problem was the hills. He didn't have alot of energy, ?? the sun were tiding it from him.
1	The features of the setting affected the cycles beceuse it was hot and was a mough train.
1	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because as he gets closer to the nearest town  the ground becomes rougher to ride on. Like when he sees the sign saying not to exceed the limit. That shows that the ground is going to be rough.
3	The features of the setting in, “Rough Road Ahead” negatively affect the cyclist. In the California desert, water is everything. If you run out of water then you might as well have run out of life. Without water, dehydration kicks in and it affects not only your body, but your mind too. The cyclist only had a limited amount of water with him when he started. ”I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly, and I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June.“ Through the deserted towns he came across, he searched for a source of water but found none that were useable.” When I tried a drop or two ,it had the flower of battery acid.” @CAPS1 feature was the heat. It began to mess with his mind and take toll on his body quickly.” I wiped the sweat from my eyes to make sure it wasn’t a mirage” He worned about heatstroke and his bodys need for water throughout the entire trip. Finally, in the deserts of California, wildlife can affect you. The cyclist was using a path that nature had claimed  and was not traveled often by people “ crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake blocked the majority of the pavement.” As you can see, the cyclist was negatively afftected by the features of the setting in, “Rough Road Ahead.”
1	The feature of the setting affected the cyclist because if there is a rough road ahead your just going to have to be able and to handle the up and downs, bumps. The author was scared that he was gonna die and that the birds were gonna pick his bones clean.
1	In the story the cyclist faces many issues that could stop him from not finishing his journey. First, his water supply could cause him to become dehydrated and he could pass out. Another issue is the hot weather in June, which could cause him to a heat stroke and literally die. The rough terrain could stop him from finishing the trip because he could pop a bike tire and would have to walk. The cyclist faces many problems that could end his trip and maybe even life, but pushs through and survives.
1	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. One way is that the cool pines keep the sun from beating down on him and from getting heatstroke. Another way is that the towns he he went to had either bad as or no water and he was becoming dehydrated. The heat from the sun was make him feel funny, he was hoping he wasn't seeing mirages.
0	The cyclist does most really like the setting of the road. It’s messing up big time
1	The setting is a desert in California in June, this affects the cyclist because it is very hot and he only has a couple drinks of water. There is no place for the cyclist stop and get more water. He says, “there is no one in sight, not a building,car, or structure of any kind.” As you can see that kind of setting would definetly affect the cyclist.
9	As you can see, technology these days is always getting more and more advanced. It seems as if there is a new invention that atracts many people to buy all the time. One electronic that has been useful in so many ways to people are the computers. Many think to much time is spent on this, but then I think about how much it's benefiting. Computers can tell you pretty much anything you need to know, @CAPS1 it's about same country, or how to solve a problem. @CAPS2, computers are so advanced were you can talk to friends who are faraway. Lastly computers is helping us giving very specific directions, rather than figuring out a map. Say you're doing a school project about a country. By typing in exactly what you need to know you can find your information in a heartbeat. @CAPS1 it's population, density, languages, foods or holidays, computers are the easiest and most simple way to get this information. Or maybe you just want to know about this country because it interested you. Maybe even you plan on visiting this country, you're going to want to know about the place you'll be spending your time. If you do plan on traveling to somewhere you've been researching, you can order your plane tickets right there online. You can figure out the routes you plan on taking, and this can help oprganize your trip. Another reason computers are benefiting so many people, is the feature of communicating with others, @CAPS1 it's taking to a faraway friend or family, or you're bestfriend a couple streets over; you probably still want to keep in touch with them. Computers are so advanced now, that they have webcams; were you can visually see the person your contacting right into the computer. This is a more exciting way to talk to someone, especially if it's someone you don't see often that @MONTH1 even live in another country, @CAPS2, most teenagers like to keep in touch pretty much every day. Usually kids like chatting on instant message just for the pleasure of talking to your friends. Finally, computers are benefiting us with knowing directions and routes. Like mentioned before, computers can give straight foward directions. This is esier to handle rather than useing a map while on the road. There are websites were all you have to do is type in your exact loocation and your exact destination and it will tell you specific roads and turns you need to take. In conclusion, those for who are worried about the ones who should be exercising, being outside, enjoying nature, should learn to expand there time doing so, and shortening time online, and learn to be on the computer, only when necessary.
1	Some feature on the setting that @MONTH1 have affected the cyclist was the fact that he was running out of water and when he pumped water he said he pumped with all his strenght at first a tar like substance oozed out follwed by brackish water he said the water tasted of battery acid. Also in this setting the cyclist notices a terrain change flat road then turned short hills , follwed by a snake that looked od a diamond back.
1	In the essay “Rough Road ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit.” By Joe Kurmaskie. The features of the setting affect the cyclist because he was on a bike and it was hot he ran into bumpy roads, and hills. For example he says “Not June miles into the next section of the road. He noticed the terrains changing. Flat land was replaced by short, rolling hills.” @CAPS1 example is “Wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that he could die from heatstroke.” These examples show that it was not easy and how the features affected the cyclist. In conclusion this story shows that you should never take directions from a old person, exspecially if its hot and you are riding a bike.
2	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many different ways. To start with, the terrain of the road turned from flat bumpy which caused the cyclist to have an easy trip. In the story it said, &quot;Rough Road ahead do not exceed posted speed limit.&quot; Since the cyclist had to use a lot more energy on the roads and his water supply was limited, he became very thirsty when he finally say an old town ahead, he stopped and it looked like it was a bandoned he began to pump water out of the water pump and no matter how long it pumped for it looked like battery acid. The quote  from the story said, &quot;when I tried a drop or two, it hard the flavor of battery acid,” that is some features of the setting that affected the cyclist throughout his journey.
2	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in this story greatly. The cyclist is cycling in a desert, “...I was travelling through the high deserts of California in June.” @CAPS1 it was hot and the sun is beating down on the cyclist, “the sun was beginning to beatdown...” @CAPS1 it is remote and there is no one to offer help or assistance, “...it fit the traditional definition of ghost town.” There are no natural water sources for the cyclist to refill his bottles of water. He might have died from dehydration. “I got down on my hands and knees and worked the handle of the rusted water pump with all my strength, but only a tarlike substance oozed out.” There @CAPS1 was a poisonous snake on the road which could have bit the cyclist. @CAPS1, there were hills that required more energy to get up. Since the cyclist had to use more energy to get up the hills he got more tired and thirsty.
3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist’s attitude towards the old men. Since the cyclist listened to the old mens directions he was furious with himself. Seeing that the last attempt of direction had caused the cyclist to become nearly delicious, the setting had added severly to the problem. The beating sun and high desserts in California in the middle of June made the cyclist dehydrated and tired. When he come to a rusted water pump “black tar oozed out, you can picture the cyclist as furious and anxious and of course thirsty. The rough terrain and tumble weeds had caused the cyclist to feel skeptical of his decision to follow the old mens-directions.
3	The cyclist in “Rough Road @CAPS1; Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” starts off in the “serenity of an easly summer evening” taking road advice from old-timers. At first when the sun was beating down on him, he didn’t mind; the thoughts of Yosemite kept him determined. Later however, his determination was fading as he realized that his “short cut” was not so short after all. The “high deserts of California in June” and the terrain changed furthered his dehydration and need to find water. The emptiness of his surrounding with “no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind” made him focus on the horizon and tell himself that if he made it there, the he’d be alright. Finally, a building came into view. The hope he got from this gave him strength to move on. Ironically it was an abandoned building. The cyclist describes it as a “Welch’s Grape Juice factory and bottling plant.” @CAPS2 this he had lost hope and hung his head. Believing he was going to die, the cyclist got back on his bike. Driving away from the factory, he saw a sight of a fish camp and immediately regained hope. Going there, he regained his strength and learned his lesson, never take road advice from other people.  
2	The setting in the reading affected the cyclist because it was hot, dry, and nothing around. Being hot was one part of the setting that affected him because he had to drink water a lot. It was dry every where around him so he couldn’t stop anywhere and cool off. Also when things got hard there was nothing around but ghost towns and abandoned buildings. This is how the setting affected him.
1	The features mentioned in the settings of the story made it harder for the cyclist. The lack of water during a summer in California  made it very uncomfortable for the cyclist to go through the deserts. The worst part was when he tried to suck the pebbles to cycle his saliva in his mouth, he ended up swallowing one.
1	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because his body has a hard time adjusting to his life threating situation. The neat and desert atmosphere are draining his body of water, @CAPS1 he needs to keep pedaling on. Also, the terrain is stripped of water, so he doesn't have anything to refuel with. 
0	I think that if we where to inforce the punishments on those who speed that there wuold be less car crashes really those that have bad road rage shuold be in anger management
10	Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 I understand your one trying to decide whether or not computers are bad for people. I for one thing that computers are turning our society anti-social, we are becoming obese, and there is alot of cyber bullying that happens via computers. You can learn about all this and more if read on. @CAPS2 a stated earlier computers many problems in @LOCATION1's social lives. You see @CAPS2 much @CAPS2 @PERCENT1 of our population spends at least @NUM1 hours a ween on the computer. When doing this they are typically . watching videos or tweeting a friends. This @MONTH1 all swim like a activity but it is really pulling us away from our social lives. There are many sites that allow you to chat with your friends and leave messages on their &quot;wall&quot; but is that really communicating? In a way it is but it is taking away social skills that we will need later on. You can't get a job by instant messaging a person, you have to talk face to face. But how will we be able to do that if we only email and @CAPS3? Plus while so much you will be prone to using in , thus you with, nothing but a bad grade. Now we to problem that we see occuring all over . You the work on the computer. This activity what , they monitor, lets you at , everyday, since he comes home and plays on the computer and more time exercising. Finally we come to my last issue, cyber bullying. Over @PERCENT2 of @CAPS4 teens will be faced with some sort of cyber bullying in their life. When teens sion up for facebook and twitter they are signing up for depression. When a teen starts to get bullied they usually become sad which then leads them grades to go lower due to lack of concentration and that leads them to be more depressed and that could make them either commit suicide or join gangs and/or start making bad . But we can prevent this if we the of time people out @NUM2 spend on computers. And I think benifit that. In conclusion I believe that is we are bad for society. I think them is we the amount of time could be lives. I think that if you look deep down into what it to say how you will understand why we need to do healthier @LOCATION1? 
2	There were many features that affected the cyclist. One feature included the first ghost town that he come by. “but on that morning it fit the traditional definition of a ghost town.” This had to affect him a little because he knows now that the people who told him the shortcut haven’t peen out for awhile. Another feature that affected the cyclist was the lack of water in a &quot;desert in California in June.&quot; The cyclist now knows that it might be awhile before he gets any more water. The hills also had an affect on the cyclist because he knew now he was going to have to work really hard to get into the next town, without drinking much water. The Welch’s building also had an affect on him since it was abandoned and no drinks were left. In conclusion, the cyclist had to battle many features on his way to the National Park.
3	The cyclist see his journey affect by a succesion of events that will make his journey trave?? every time more difficul and difficult. One of the first errors his makes is take advice from people that have no clue of where there are at. @CAPS1 (I shouldn't have done was let them have a peek at my map.) The temperature of the desert also influenced him (I was travelling through high desert of California). The  cyclist also finds his' self with a combination of emotions at times he thinks he is going to past away and at times he believes he will be fine. (@CAPS1 @NUM1) As i stumbled into a rather modern bathroom and drunk deeply from the sink, I thought i had a over whelming wigs to seek Gary.
2	The features of the start affected the cyclist by going listing to so dyhrate who have not left town pours in this instead of following his name got him going in the middle like the start sites on the sreach make right site at the ??.???? the what he steal inside that &quot;I reached myself riht then that I'd always asked to it????????? find on the last ?? is the bitter. this is said ?? he did not  ?? the sight and felt he walking not make, fall on the ?? and get dust stick. Did he ??? want to happen gian so be ?? to always look at the map.     
1	In the story, The man has a very hard time trying to get to some water. He faces many obsticales in the story. For example, he has gone about @NUM1 miles without water. Also, their are a lot of hills and turns withen the story which slow him down He is having a hard time getting to water because of many obsticals
3	In the story the cyclist is on a bike ride to @LOCATION1. He has a new map is doing very well, until he asks these old men the best way to get there taking less time and by getting these faster a.k.a a short at. He takes there directions and feels good abut it. But soon things change, he experiences new terrain and it becomes much harder. The type of setting that he faces are steep hills, speed limits that he can’t exceed, dry hot temperature, and he has no water. All these features combine together to make the situation worse. While he is experiencing these things he feels like he is going to die and feels like giving up. But eventually he finds someone and doesn’t ask for directions. So the lession is don’t take directions from a stranger unless your willing to face the unexpected. 
2	The features affected the cyclist because of the rough roads. This affected him because it slowed him down, I know this because in the story it said “Rough Road Ahead Do not Exceed Posted speed Limit”. which this means slow down or you will have an accident. Another feature has it was hot which means he was losing water because it either evaporated or he was drinking it. I know this because it said “The water bottles contained  water a few tantalizing sips” which means it was few left.
3	The settings affect the cyclist in many ways on the way to Yosemite. Well for one when he took the shortcut, one thing that already made it difficult was that it was June, and he’s out in the desert. Also it says how he went to a couple towns that were deserted so there was no way to replenish his water. It says, “I pumped that handle for several minutes, but the water wouldn’t cool down. When I tried a drop or two, it had the flavor of battery acid.” @CAPS1 thing about his setting that changed was the hills.  But once he came to a bait shop, the old man asks  him if he  knows the best way to get to Yosemite, and he responds, “yes- sir: I own a very good map.” @CAPS2 by this he’s understood that the best way to travel anywhere is the path or road he knows because he’ll know what to expect. This is how the setting changed.
1	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. One of the ways are that it is affecting him is that the discription of it makes it seem hotter then what it really is. He says “neihbor hood of two hundred degrees.” He is saying that it is really hot. The features of the setting affected him because I mad it seem hoter and he was taking it to far.
1	In the essay the features of the setting affected the cyclist. The cyclist used words to discribe the setting like “flat road” and “short, rolling hills”, There were also more example. The way the cyclist discribed the setting gave the reader a visual picture. I think the cyclist was affected by the setting.
1	In the story “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” by Joe Kurmaskie, depending how the main character feels, that’s what the setting is like. When he got the next town and left he was feeling well because nothing was going wrong. The setting was very tranquil. The narrator says, “The cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite had my name written all over them”(Kurmaskie). This setting was very happy and pleasant just like the narrators mood.
8	Dear (Newspaper), This is a very controversial topic. I am discussing. But on this one, I must say I agree with the experts when they say computers have a negative effect on people. It ruins their social lives, and other bad things. If you spend all your time on the computer, you get no exercise, no fresh air, and you will not get to experience the rest of the world. Not recieving your daily exercise is a big problem. Obesity has already been an issue for millions people in the @LOCATION1 And it is mostly because they eat unhealthy snacks while sitting at the computer the whole day! you want to live a long and healthy life, don't spend all your time having your eyes give to a screen. In adition everyone needs fresh air, right? Going on the computer inside a room is not going to help at all. You need your daily intake of oxygen. Lastly, if you are on long enough, enough, it will become an obsession. Computers already have a bad effect on people all around, and just think about what has just been mentioned. Another problem computers have is that they keep you away from your family and friends. As mentioned before, the social life you had will be gone. With that in mind, people will always see you on the computer, and eventually get sick of you. Computers bring no adventures, just pictures of them. Going out into the real world might be hard, but it is something that should be done. a real life cannot be lived in a dark room with no people or no nature. Haven't you always wanted to travel around the world, see different types of cultures, lifesyles, etc? It gets to the point where computer use should be limite, and living your life should be in place of your free time. Using a computer all day will not let you meet new people, and see new places. You will sbe getting nowhere with a computer screen in your face, so put it away! In conclusion, using computers all the time restrict you from exercising, getting fresh air. Meeting new people, and seeing different places all over. At the end up the day, life is short, so you can't aford to waste it. computers have a negative effect on everbody, and hopefully someday these problems will be changed!
2	Some things that affected the cyclist was the terrain changing into a flat road that was replace by short, rolling hills. Then he came to a rough road. Another obstacle from the cyclist was the tar-like substance that came out the rusted water pump followed by brackish water feeling somewhere of @NUM1 hundred degrees. Everytime he pumped it wouldn’t cool down and the water tasted like battery acid. He was hitting his water bottle regularly that is why he needed new water. The cyclist was travelling through the high deserts of California and the sun was starting to beat down so he was dehydrated. The snake blocked the pavement in front of him that looked like diamond back.  
3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in the the short story “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” The getting of the story is, “a reservoir campground outside of @CAPS1, California” during the early summer. Being the early summer in souther California, the temperatures are going to be hot. And the main character, who is a cyclist and is doing a lot of physical activity, is a going to sweat a lots. The temperature and excessive sweating cause the cyclist to drink a lot of water. The water runs out and we are now it our conflict. The setting also reads the main character to his resolution of the conflict. Being by a reserveir, fishing is going to be a popular activity. A bait and tackle shop would be the perfect business to have, since there who is at bait and tackle shop, the cyclist could go inside a quinch his thirst. Therefore, the setting of the story affect affects the conflict and the solution.
3	The cyclist decided to ride to Yosemite National Park during a hot summer day in California. His first instincts was to use a perfectly good map that was up to date. Then he started having a conversation with some old me who decided that they would tell him a short cut they took back in the day. The cyclist decided to take the old’s men’s short cut through the desert with one meschy bottle of water. It was really hot out side and the sun was scorging down on his back while he was riding his bike. This made him hotter than he ??? and there was no shade are place for him to top and get some water. This made the trip harder for him because now he was focused on finding water and not on his ride. The settings of the cause effected the cyclist in many ways he was not prepared for the route, and the route he took was not biker friendly. If he would have took the route that was on the map then he would have know where he was and his ride would not have been affected by thoughts of slowing down to put rocks in the moth to reserve water or thoughts of finding water he would 
3	The cyclist a had rough time. The elements were against him. It was dry and hot and he had no water. In the text it says,&quot;The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips. &quot;This shows that he had hardly any water, and what he did have would only make him thirster. &quot;@CAPS1 weeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake. &quot;It was obviously not and the quote maker you visualize a desert or colorado. The man was no one in sight not a building, car, or structure of any kind. He was saving up his energy and his water. He was starting to go a little crazy. The hills were killer for him, in the text it says &quot;over one long, crippling hill.&quot; This show you now rough the conditions were because he told us in the begining that he is a cyclist. The biker hell a very rough time and the setting definity effects this. 
1	The wether can change the corse of action a cyclist will take. If it is cold out side then the cyclist will bring beveyer cloths if its. Hoter out side he would most likly bring lighter clothes. If he was riding farther hed bring more supplys like water and food If he was going on a short rid then he wouldn’t bring so much stuff. The way the wether is changes the way a person will prepaire,
2	In the story “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Speed limit” by Joe Kurmaskie the different aspects of the setting effect the cyclist in several ways. When he first begins he doesn’t even notice how hot it is and he says, “the ran was beginning to beat down, but I barely noticed it.” His mood starts to change very quickly. Soon he drinks most of his water of becomes increasingly tired. He finds a water pump which irriates him when he realize the water tastes like “battery acid.” As he continues he sees a snake which he could swear was a diamond back so he slowly goes by out. When he notices a factory he uses his last bit of energy to reach it only to be discouraged when he finds it abandone. His spirits finally rise when he finds a store and drinks a good amount of water.
2	Multiple parts of the setting effect the cyclist; When he arrives in a town with a water pump, but this pump doesn’t have good water, “when I tried a drop or two, it had the flavor of battery acid“ (Kurmaskie @NUM1). This part of terrain shows its effect. When he becomes very dehydrated, “in my dehydrated state“ (kurmaskie @NUM1). Another part of the setting that effected the cyclist was when he arrived at the juice factory and it was closed which depressed him.
2	The cyclist in this short story was greatly affected by the setting. He was riding in a desert which is very hot, with little civilization to help him. Also the rode that was driving on was not very smooth which gave him troubles. The wildlife also had an impact on him. He once went by a big snake that he cautiously had to ride around. Also he thought he was going to die and that the birds were going to pick him off. The desert itself was what really got to hm. Deserts don’t have much water which is what he needed and he couldn’t find a town to stop at, at least one with some people any way. So the setting in which the main character was riding had a huge effect on him.
2	The cyclist was exhausted as he was going up hill. The setting of story affects the cyclist alot. This is because in California it is really good to be cycling. The weather is warm and perfect for a town. It had one ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps and a coral that could not hold in the lamest mule greeted him.Besides that, after riding twenty miles ahead, there was a terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short rolling hills. After he crested the first few of these, a large highway sign jumped out at him. The rough road was the time where he had to be really careful and not to exceed the speed limit.
2	The setting of the essay greatly affected the cyclist. These settings discourage him, although he tries to keep hope. Seeing dry desert, hills begin to heighten, nothing man-made is in sight. These subconsciously affect the cyclist and his growth of thirst. To one point the cyclists original objective became invalidated for his thirst pangs and exhaustion.
6	Dear local newspaper, I feel very strong about my opinion of what effects computers have on people as in it helps others communicate with one another, give people info about different types of things, and make people smarter. To me that sounds like something with a positive effect, would you say? First of all, as some people say it doesnt let you interact with family members. Yes it truely does you can interact with both friends, and family members by going to chat rooms such as aim, meebo.web cam meeting such as skype.com. So that throw that concern out or the window you work have to worry about that. Secondly, you get to learn info about differnt types of things such as learning about wild animals any animal like a giraffe, cat, rat or learn about different places like @LOCATION2, @LOCATION3, and @LOCATION1 etc... Also you could find all of this info at home in one day. Most important I would make people smarter the computer teaches you hand eye corrdinations for free. The computer can teach you about any career, or regular job that you would need to learn about in just minutes, if needed? To conclude computers have positive effect on people, it lets people communicate with friends and family, you get to learn about different types of things, and it makes people smarter. Even I was done reading this it I thanked the lord for computer, it helps us so much.
2	Being a cyclist is not as easy as it sounds. Sure riding a bike might be easy, but being a cyclist is so much more difficult. Cyclist have many obsticles to over come while riding. One obstacle would be a rough terrain. Cyclist are used to riding on smooth, paved roads. Going off – road or riding on a dirt road might be a challenge. In the short story “Do Exceed posted Speed Limit”, by Joe Kurmaskie also has another example for an obsticle cyclist have to be careful of, and that is running out of water, “I eased past, trying to keep by balance in my dehydrated state” (@CAPS1 @NUM1). The cyclist went on in telling how he needed to try to keep his balance but it was hard because he was dehydrated, and balancing is important when riding a bike. In conclusion when it comes to as easy as riding a bike, you need to take precaution in what might lie ahead.
3	The setting affects the cyclist in many ways. It makes him feel hopeful, determined, alone, and completely exhausted. The desert- like terrain leaves him feeling very tired and thirsty. The bumpy road is hard to pedal over, and the endless stretches of land make him feel as if the next town is years away. While travelling, the cyclist recalls “At some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake . blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me” (Kurmaskie, @NUM1).The tumbleweeds are a symbol of dry desert death. They remind the cyclist he is completely alone in a vast stretch of sand and rocks. Were the snake in the path to poison him he’d not only under the beaty sun until some other unfortunate cyclist found him. However, later on when he sees the sign for Gary and Wilber’s fish camp, the hope is restored back to him. He is yet again determined because waiting somewhere near is the water he needs to keep him alive. In the end, the setting helped him to safely feel the hope deep inside of him.
2	The feateres of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. For example &quot;not two mlles into this next section of the ride, I noticed the terrain changin. Flat road was replaced by short, rolling  hills. &quot;This affected the cyclist because he had to pedal  harder to go up the hills and he got short of breath due to this. Another example  is, &quot;At some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path and a rediculously large snake-it really did look like a diamondback-blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me.” This affected the cyclist because he had to wait for the snake to move so it didnt bite him while he crossed it. One last example is, &quot;As I stumbled into a rather modem bathroom and drank deeply from the sink, I had an overwhelming urge to seek out @PERSON1 and Wilber” This had an affect on the cyclist because he was now hapy to have water and have reached his destination.
1	The features of the setting affected the cyclist because he saw “short, rolling hills,” tumbleweeds” and “a ridiculously large shake,” and he thought that he was not getting anywhere.
1	Each area the author entered changed what he felt and experienced. At first, he is lent courage by his surroundings. When he passes through the first town, abandoned and empty, he is still confidant he can go on sparred by the lush green trees and the cool rivers around him that belied the hot sun overhead. They are basically the reason he continued to go on. Later on during his trek through the desolated empty desert, his bleak surroundings make him feel hopelessness as well as despair. Even in the small details, such as the ghost town or the pump, this is ploven, as the ghost town brings him the first vestige of despair, and the useless pump only amplifys it. The scenario and scenery reflect and alter the authors mood throughout the story.
1	The rider was affected by two men giving him wrong directions. The rider followed their advice instead of taking the right way he ended up taking the long way. He was getting very thribiy. He also came face to face with a snake. Then he finally found the nearest town in got help.
1	Some features of the setting that affect the cyclist are. The hills that the cyclisit has to go over and the heat. The heat is making the cyclist sweat alot so he is loosing fluids and he starts to got dyhydrated. The hills are making him have to work harder and getting more tired.
3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist in many ways. They affected his confidence, his energy, and his determination. In the beginning of the essay the cyclist is very confident. This is show when he says.” The cool pined and rushing rivers of yosemite has my name written all over them. This shows confidence because he knows he can make it to yosemite.When he runs out of water he begins to lose confidence and thinks he way die. Since he ran out of water because of the heat, his energy is also dropped. You know he’s running out of water when he says.“The water bottle contained only a few tantalizing sips.” @CAPS1, after lose of water and confidence; he actually had higher determination to make it to Yosemite. This is human nature because our bodies when into survivor mode and become determined to survive. As you can see the cyclist was affected in many ways by the features of the setting.
2	Many things that the author talks about in the story affect him: One example in the oldmen that give him advice. They tell him that they know a great shortcut which turns into the authors hardest ride ever. Another example is: the heat, the location, time of day, and time of the year. In California, in @DATE1 in the dessert will give you lots of heat. In order to beat this heat you need lots of water which is one of his biggest problems. He runs out of water. Another hindering thing he discovers is the abandoned welches grape juice building where he sees a picture of a boy drinking a refreshing glass of grape juice. All these combined gave the author a hard time but in the end he found a bait and tackle shop where he was saved
3	In the story “Rough Road Ahead Do not exceed posted speeed limit,” the cyclist is affected by features of the setting. In the story it says “The sun was beginning to beat down. “This quote means that it was getting hotter and this was going to make it harder for the cyclist to ride. Another quote that states that the features of the setting affects the cyclist is “Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.” This means that the cyclist is cold not only going to have to deal with the heat, but he is also going to have to side-over hill after hill. Eventhough they @MONTH1 be small, rolling hills, it still takes alot of energy out of you to ride up and down hills repeatedly. A third quote that shows the setting affecting the cyclist is “I got down on my hands and knes, walking the handle of the rusted water pump with all my strength. A tar like substance oozed out, followed  by brackish water feling somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees “this quote means the cyclist is so desperate to get water, that he uses his small amount of strength left to try and get some water. When he finally does get some water, it first come out as an ooey substance then the water come out really hot. In conclusion, these have been examples of how the cyclist was affected by features of the setting. 
9	Dear @CAPS1, I'm writing to you today about computers I believe that computers can teach you things such as, hand-eye coordination and how that, can open job doors for you. Also you can socialize as well as study with this device. My first reason being socialization. i think that this is a good way to socialize due to the many options. one example would be facebook. This is a social website that is used to connect or reconnect with friends. in a recent poll @NUM1 out of @NUM2 people say that computers had made them more social. Lastly, computers are a good way to socialize because of the range it can travel. You can talk to people without the long distance fees of . This can range from the @CAPS2.S to hungary in seconds. My second reason would be that computers are useful in studies. I would say this because even though books are good they use hard to find. With the computer you can access multiple sites. This being you can from wikipedia all the way to the infamous google in just . Another reason I believe computers are good for studies in that you have endless. you will get a the . The lost . My third and final reason is computer give you exceptional hand-eye coordination can because I know accountant. i asked him, &quot;@CAPS3 did you take that accounting job?&quot;, and he answered, &quot;They only took me because I have good hand-eye coordination.&quot; @CAPS4 thats one job exemple, another would be real state. Due to computers multiple options you can look up because in the your client. With good hand-eye, however, you can be more efficiecnt with your work. This could help you lead competition, thus, making you more money. This then ends my essay. Stating with socialization, skipping down to studies and ending right on jobs and and bye's front steps. These are only @NUM3 of the many bountiful things that a computer can do. @CAPS1 I hope you read this with my regards.
1	I think that the features of the setting affected the cyclist because of the sharp turns and the lonelyness it say in the text “About forty miles into the pedal. I arrived at the first town.”
3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist greatly because there was tough terrain. The heat had affected him greatly as well. He seemed that every where he would go, he couldn’t find anything, no buildings or people until he got that one town. In the story, “Rough Road Ahead;Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” the cyclist qoutes.“At same point, tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake.” @CAPS1 your bike on the middle of the desert, not knowing which way to go and only seeing  harsher conditions can only give you no hope .He soon almost ran out of water only made things worst.The sun beating down on him and his mind playing tricks on him also, so with the cyclist , settings had alot to do with his journey.
3	The features the cyclist experianced during his ride affect his body and mind. At first the cyclist was on flat graund, drinking plenty of water and without fear. But when he came to his second town, he became ton on water. This troubled him, but he was optomistic telling himself “the next town was only eighteen miles.” After this the road was replaced by short, rolling hills.” this started to trouble him. Dehydration started to set him and every hill was a challenge. Once out of water he sucked on pebbles and hopped it would “take your mind off of thirst.” When he finally made it, he was so relieved. Everything from dehydration, wich affects the body to lozing hope affected the cyclist on his ride
2	The conditions in the California desert were horrible for a cyclist. The temperature was extremely high and the humidity was very dry. The roads also had a lot of hills and when a cyclist has to use his energy in the heat to go up and down hill after hill, it can be very hard. There were also no stops to refill his water a long the way,which is bad because the neat,lack of water,and all of his energy extension leads to major dehydration.The conditions along this trip are not good for a cyclist and can be very dangerous.
1	The setting of the essay “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed posted speed limit” affected the cyclest greatly. He was riding through a desert in June. This meant that the temperature was very high. The narrator even states “I could drop from heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June.” @CAPS1 feature of the setting that affected him were the hills. He even calls them
1	The features of the setting affects the cyclist because he knows he’s in the wrong area. The cyclist understand's that he should have never took that advice from them old men. So he was upset and new he should have taken his advise. The cyclist had a feeling that he wasn’t supposed to take it that way he said he shouldn’t have let them take a peek at his map. So the features really affect him.
3	In ‘Rough Road Ahead” by Joe Kurmaskie the main character faces a lot of trouble. First people give him the wrong directions. But, worst of all he has to travel a lot of mile on a bike through extreme temperatures. Going up and down hills and pedaling really hard. He doesn’t even have any cool water. As the character says, “…followed by brackish water feeling somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees (kurmaskie @NUM1). That kind of water didn’t help him either. It didn’t quench his thirst because it was so hot, he said it tasted like battery acid. But, finally he worked up his confidence and kept pedalig till he found a fish camp that had a bathroom with a sink that had cool water. Then he headed off to Yosemite and didn’t take anyone’s advice.
2	The features of the setting effected the cyclist. The setting was a desert in California making it VERY hot outside. The hills were hard to climb and there were dangers all around such as poisonous snakes. Not just this was terrain hard to move around on but the path was thickest. “@CAPS1 weeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake.” This made it harder for the cyclist to reach his destination.
1	In the towns that the cyclist arrived at were all ghost towns. In the text, the author said, “it fit the traditional definition of a ghost town.” It affected the cyclist because, with the towns being deserted, the cyclist couldn’t refill hi water.
1	The cyclist was motivated to get the job done. When they   said only “    eighteen miles down the road.” He thought it was going to be forever but he made it because he “conserved his water ...” and last kept on going, when the road   turned into a rocky gravel road, he still kept on going, but it was harder on his legs and water supply.
7	I believe that computers have good effects on people. Computers allow people to stay in touch with long distance friends or family. Computers have games for kids that help them learn, and, also, people learn new things, too. My first reason is that, computers allow people to stay in touch. If someone in their family live long distance then they could always use e-mails to talk. That way they wont lose each other. Also, sometimes, friends move away and you always want to keep in touch. Another thing is that, if they want to send photos to each other, they can use e-mail. Also, because, thru an mail takes forever. Please, let the people stay in touch! My second reason is that, computers has games kids play. The games kids play could help them learn more. Sometimes watching t.v. don't help. If they acutually play the game and see what their doing, then they will got smarter. That's what we want for our kids, right? Also, kids have fun playing these games. Do you really want to take the learning experience away? My third reason is, computers help people learn new things. Like, they could go on the computer and learn what's happening in the world. People can learn new words they never knew about. Also, pictures on the computer help, too. For example, if someone is traveling somewhere, and they don't know how the price. They can get on the computer and check it out, right? So, in conclusion, I believe that computers are good use. They help people stay in touch, help kids learn by playing games and help people learn new things about the world and more. So, I'm saying, please, keep the computers. They are not a waste of our time. Turst me!
8	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I think that children are spending to much time on the computer for the wrong reasons. I say this because all young children and teenagers want to do is get on to @CAPS3 and @CAPS4 all day instead of reaserching and things like that. I have three reason's why I think going on the computer for the wrong reasons instead of exercising, enjoying nature and interacting with family and friend is a @CAPS5 first reason is because it is very dangerous and there are sometimes kidnappers on the chat room. @CAPS5 second reason is because their taking time away from trying to learn stuff off the internet. @CAPS5 final reason is because the interact influences violence. There are @CAPS5 three reason, on to here more. @CAPS5 reason number one why I say people are spending to much time on the internet is because it is dangerous. Young teenagers and children all enter a chat room online. Most of the time that is bad because kidnappers lie about their information so that you can meet up with them and then they take you away. So instead of being on the chat room you could be on the computer looking on the daily news or searching like that. This is why I say that the internet is not alway good to be on all the time if you aren't or learning about the nation. @CAPS5 second reason why I that speding too much time on the computer all the great sometimes is its taking away from your come in the and go to the computer instead of doing their homework on reading. @CAPS6 like computer sometimes more than they like is learned and thats not good because not knowing I could if they got up their is on the computer for educational games but they dont. reason why I am concerned that people using the computer a lot. @CAPS5 final reason why I am concerned about people using the computer to much is because the internet on the computer can influence @CAPS6 to be violent in @CAPS5 ways all games and going on yo all the that affects the world if they keep seeing violence and things in that nature frequently. I say this because in this generation when they see violence it gives an image in more need and then @MONTH1 think its cool to do it because it @CAPS6 like @CAPS3 more than a book on the computer more than a look. When young teens see violence on the computer @MONTH1 think it's cool. This is @CAPS5 final reason why I was concerned that people are spending too much time on the computer. So these one some of the main reasons why I say that the computer is not always a good because people spend a much time on them.
1	The condition the cyclist are in calls for a lot of preparation. The cyclist was in a hot desert area with winding road and hills. The cyclist need to have plenty of water to make it where he is going, and, as read in the story, the conditions almost caused @CAPS1 health to the man who was trying to ride through.
3	Setting in “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” really determines how the story turns out. The setting was in deserted areas, the desert, and even roadways. In the desert, there is no water making the cyclist become dehydrated. without water, he thought he was going to die. In the road areas, the speed limits was extremly high fifty-five miles per hour. This would not be good since he is doing  “ a water-depleting @NUM1.” When he finds areas that are abandoned, these are water pumps, but the liquid that comes out @MONTH1 be water, but it tastes like “battery acid.” Setting can affect alot in the story. Without this setting, the story would be alot different than it is now.
2	In the story Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit by Joe Kurmaskie, the cyclist had a couple of problems turning his journey little, amount of water, tough roads, including there were no cars on the road either. It all caused a lot of difficulty for the cyclist like on page @NUM1 paragraph one the first sentence “It didn’t really matter. In was going to die and the birds would pick me down” The elements were so tough on the cyclist that he or she was going to going to give hope. But luckly in the end the cyclist found a place to stop and get water with directions.
2	The features of the setting affect the cyclist. He is trying to get water but when he tried the pump, “a tarlike substance oozed out, followed by brackish water feeling somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees”. The cyclist doesn’t have any water so it is difficult to go on. He could suffer from heat exhaustion. As he came to the next town, he found, “the building - abandoned years earlier, had been a Welch’s Grape Juice Factory and bottling plant”. He is still thinking of getting to the next town to get something to drink. That is how the features of the setting affect the cyclist.
2	In the story there were many features of the setting tha affected the cyclist. One that had the greatest impact was that it was dry and hot, and that the terrain was very rough in the desert. Being that it was dry and hot made his ride hard. For example, the heat caused him to get dehydrated on his journey and begin to feel signs of heatstroke. The terrain caused an even bigger dilema. For example, in the story him riding through that terrain causes him to get tired and become even more dehydrated than he already is.   
3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist a lot. First is the emptiness, the feeling that he is all alone. Nor a car, person  or building in sight. The fact that if something were to happen then there would be no way of telling anyone. That it would be along while before  anyone would be able to  find him. Nor that  might ecase some, But I think dalved him even more. It gave him that extra boost of energy that seems  to have come out of nowhere. Then there is the type of animal. The desert environment is very, unforgiving. The sun beats down like your only person on the plannet. The lack of water the food that it hasn’t rained in decades. The never ending, @CAPS1 road. The ups and downs and all the animals that await him. The fact that if he stops at all, ever, then a snake could easily bite him and that would be the end of it. These extreme conditions and the harsh environment that is explained in the text has alot to do with the cyclist and affects him a great deal.  
1	The setting of this short story affects the cyclist by making him dehydrated and dies. Also in the setting he found the abandon factory which makes him feel hopeless. If the setting was elsewhere then this setting he would have felt different as he didn’t  meet the people  of the reserve he could have been in the better roads than the old roads he was in
3	The countries of the setting that had the most effect on the cyclist were the deserts and hills. The author tells us first of his depleting water supply as he journeys through the high deserts of California in June. “The hills had a major effect on him because the intensive host that any desert contains, with this heat, his limited water, and the fact that it was June. I’m sure the author was most a happy person traveling within his intensive journey. Another misfortune that the author explains is the touring changing.” That road was replaced by a host rolling hills. “With my own experience, I know these cannot be a worse kind. Tall steep hills are a difficult climb, but your a living house the luxurious most to cool. In his mind too with, the author’s “Short, rolling hills”, the climb gets more miserable with every hill, and the coast down the other side barely cools your bare skin, leaving your thiving soul to continue in this dep pain. I’m sure the cyclist was experiencing a burned out spirit after just a few of those deadly hills.    
1	The features of the setting have affected the cyclist in “Do not exceed posted speed limit&quot; greatly, first he statrs off happy because he’s going to Yosemite national park and he’d gotten short cut advice that would make his trip shorter. &quot;He rode into the morning with strong legs,” Then he got to the first stop. It looked like a buzzing town at one time, but now a ghost town. So he kept on with plenty of water and thought he could make it to the next stop. The next stop was an old abandoned gas station where the only water was @NUM1. He was hitting the water pretty regular and the hot sun was beating down on him. The next terrain changed he thought he would die &amp; have the vultures pick his bones because he took advice from old timers, then became to his next stop which seemed to be an old welch’s grape juice factory. He thought he would die of thirst but he kept on with little water a hot sun. next the hills came &amp; he paced himself a little time, then he finally came to a modern looking place with cool running water with an old man who gave him directions that he gladly took. After that he been through asuring himself he would die he was relieved to see the old man’s there he would forever on listen to their advice because he made it.
2	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because someone travelling a good distance in California during June will be hot. If the cyclist doesn’t have enough water to supply himself for if he gets lost then the features of the setting are very crucial. Not having enough water can cause someone to dehydrate, which does happen to the cyclist in the essay. “I eased past, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state. “This statement proves that the cyclist wasn’t a good state to be lost when the sun is blazing down on him. Also, when you are dehydrated and tired you @MONTH1 start to see things that aren’t there, but you want to see those things. “ I wiped the sweat from my eyes to make sure it wasn’t a mirage, and tried not to get too excited. “It was a good decision that the cyclist didn’t get his hopes up about a building that might not be there overall, features of a setting for a cyclist can cause anything to happen, so be careful.
8	Dear @CAPS1, Technology such as computer is proven to have a positive effect on people. Computers teach you hand eye coordination, they give you the ability to learn about far away places, and allow you to communicate with others online. Technology is continuing to grow, and it is becoming to impact our lives more and more each day. One way that computers benifit society is that they teach you hand-eye coordination. For example, as a person becomes firmiliar with their computer they are soon able to type on the keyboard with out even looking down to see what letter or number they are touching with their fingers. Although the person isn't developing hand-eye coordination @CAPS2 playing a sport such as baseball, they have still developed this coordination. Computers also benifit our society because they give others the ability to learn about far away places. Instead of walking or driving to the library to find a book about @LOCATION1; they can simply go online and type in @LOCATION1 under a search engine. Within seconds, thousands of sources appear right before your eyes, and you didnt even have to leave your chair! That is another reason why computers benifit our society. Lastly, computers and technology benifit our society becaus' they allow you to communicate with others, reconnect with old friend or family, or simply share the latest drama from your art class. I know when ever I'm at my computer my instant messanger is always open. It is something I utilize everyday in order to communicate with my friends and distant realitive. In conclusion, computers do benifit society, and they are proven to have a positive affect on people. Technology is like a sponge, it absorbs information and then continue to expand everytime you add more. *@CAPS2 doing this I am able to maintain healthy strong realationships with othe.
3	The features of the setting extremely affect the adjust in the ride to the meet town. It was bad enough that the adjust the out of water but on top of that by faced, rolling wills, makes and hard road condition all of these setting played a huge will in the cyclist puformance, &quot;it motued the terrain changing. that way was replaced by that rolling hills.&quot; He also says &quot;tumbleweed around my matt and a includesouly change snake it really did look like a demand luck blocked the majority of the movement in front of me. These setting made it difficult for the adjust to reform because the hills snakes and tumbleweed disturbed the adjust to advanced in the ride. He ran out of water no it was hard to reduce up will and the night of a deadly snake made the adjust named and worked to the difficulty of pufornenance for the cyclist
1	The features of the setting affect the cyclist was like saying you are old and that you know nothing at all. But it is not true. It means you are older and that your information @MONTH1 not be correct for example in the essay when he was on his way to the town he learned to use his map instead of a guys opinion because the guy was wrong.
2	The first town the cyclist came to was like a ghost town because there was nobody was there. The next town wasn’t any better because it was @NUM1 miles down the road. The cyclist faced some problems while on the journey. Some of these problems included snakes - The fact that he wos running out of water- the hill-and the condition of the road.
3	The features of the setting in “DO NOT EXCEED POSTED SPEED LIMIT” affect the cyclist in a negative way. The terrain goes from being very mild to rough and rolling. Considering that the author does not know the layout of this terrain very well, he begins to struggle. The author is very unsure of where to go and begins encountering obstacles such as, tumbleweed, snakes and lack of water. The fact that the author is running out of water, makes continuing on a very stressful. He is worried that he will die of dehydration before he ever reaches Yosemite National Park. Finally, with much strength and determination, he reaches a fish a Fish camp. He is able to fill his water supply and regain his strength before pressing on.
1	The   features of the setting affect the cyclist because he is in a hot of dry place and has no water. He is pedaling up hills and that makes him even more tired. The dude is probably dehydrated and   his  conditions   are getting worse!
3	The features of the settings affects the cyclist a lot in the passage called  “Rough Road Ahead: Do not Exceed Posted Speed Limit”. Cyclist are in very good physical shape. They can cycle for along time; however, weather can affect the cyclist. This happened in the passage. The cyclist was determined and confident he could make this journey. “I would conserve my water and go inward for an hour or so- a test of my inner spirit. Even though he had confidence the features of the setting affected the cyclist. “Tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake….”. “The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips”. The cyclist was tired and exhausted. The weather and terrain had worn him down. The weather can change my level of ability sometimes. I love to play basketball outside. When it is hot and humid out I can’t play as long. The features of a setting can clearly affect people.
2	During this bikers adventure heat and lack of water affect him. In this short story when the cyclist feels lost he says “I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June” This suggests that the rider was faced with the extreme heat of the desert during his ride. He also says “The water bottles contained only a few tantilizing sips.” This quote shows that not only was he faced with the heat, but also with lack of water. These facts and quotes show the clear threats this biker faced on his long bike-ride.
3	The settings affect the cyclist in more than one way. These ways are that he is running out of water, he might become dehydrated and he is unsure of the path he is on. With him running out of water, he is in real trouble. Because of the lack of water, not only might be die but he begins to see mirages. His lack of water eventually leads to dehydration and he become uneasy about things. For example; in the text it says that he staggered into the store. Because he is unsure of the path he is on, he begins to panic a little. Panicing isn’t good especially considering that he is running low on water and is becoming dehydrated. Panic can’t help to solve anything. The setting is in a dessert so he needs lets of water, which he runs low on. Desserts are extremly hot which causes a person to become dehydrated or die. Desserts have little shade, if any; and they have rough weather as well as rough landscape. For example, they’re landscape is mostly all hot sand. Therefore, the setting does affect the cyclist.
2	The setting which is a desert in the summer affects the cyclist. For example, she caldn’t go as fast, “The speed limit was 55 mph. I was doing a water-depleting 12 mph,” so that affected his ability to find water. The setting was also really hot, so the cyclist had a hard time getting the water he needed to keep going. For example, “I pumped that handle for several minutes, but the water wouldn’t cool down.” @CAPS1 how the setting has got on to him, and he needs water badly. The desert setting also affects the cyclist mind. He believed he was seeing mirages and he was afraid he was going to swallow a stone because he might hit a bump. The desert setting affects the cyclist ability to function.  
3	In the story “Rough Road Ahead” the features of the setting affect the cyclist. At points the setting mode the author feel depressed and sad and at other times, happy and joyful. For example, the cyclist was pedaling and pedaling with nothing in sight. In twenty miles he saw camp ?? a ?? that he was thirsty and had holes. When he pumped the water, no  come out. These part of the setting gave the cyclist a bad affect. The cyclist gave &quot;teaches life can be so cruel&quot; He obviously had a bad effect if he thought life was being cruel At some point in the story the setting be a good affect on the reader. He is able to die of thirst when he sees a bait shop. This puts the cyclist in a good mood because he said “my troubles thirst and feels he all behind me” different settings in the story gave the author a different affect. 
10	Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 are not bad for society. They actually can be quite good for people. Computers allow us to talk with people online. They can help us in school and give information we need to do things in life. People think they are bad, but all you have to do is look a little deeper and you will find the good in @CAPS7. @CAPS5 people use a @CAPS2, &lt;@PERCENT2@NUM1&gt; of the time @CAPS7 is to talk with people on the @CAPS3, whether @CAPS7 is using video chat or e-mail. People who don't like to use @CAPS2 and e-mail @CAPS10 &quot;@CAPS4 not use a phone or even talk to them in person.&quot; With e-mail, you can send a message to some one miles away. If you are sending someone a list, a recipe for example. you don't want to @CAPS10 to them over the phone. @CAPS7 would be easier to type @CAPS7 out and then send @CAPS7 to them over the e-mail. &quot;@CAPS5 my son said. he was going to tech me how to use e-mail, I thought @CAPS7 was going to be a waste of time,&quot; @CAPS6 @PERSON1, senior citizen. &quot;@CAPS7 tursns out, @CAPS7 wasn't. Now i use e-mail e-mail every day. Many people think email is a waste of time, but @CAPS7 can help you in your everyday life. The @CAPS3 can helps in @MONTH1 ways also. @CAPS7 can help us get information about various topics. If you are trying to cook a stir fry but you don't know what to put in @CAPS7. You try to call you mother but she isn't there. Your next choise is to look look @CAPS7 up on the @CAPS2. @CAPS7 turns out theres a website that gives a recipe for a stir fry and you follow a do make the best one even. I know for an experience that you can find maps to places on line, since i have to go some is here almost everyweek. Google map is the most used place on the @CAPS3, besides e-mail. Some newspaper have websites @CAPS11 you can read the paper without actually paying for the paper This saves you money and @CAPS7 was less paper @CAPS11 we can save trees. The huge world of the @CAPS3 can change our lives. @PERCENT1 of people that use the @CAPS2 almost everyday are students. Students use the @CAPS2 for many reasons. The biggest one is typing. Students use typing to type reports and e-mail. &quot;I have messy handwriting&quot;, @CAPS10 student, @PERSON2. &quot;@CAPS11 if if weren't for the @CAPS2, no one would be able to read my homework and reports. Not even me&quot; @PERSON2 is the one of many people who are lucking that they harmy typing on the @CAPS2. Another reason students use @CAPS2 is to look up information for reports. If a student puts a bibliography in his report, you will see that he/she used the @CAPS3 @PERCENT2 of the time. There @MONTH1 not be a book in a local library for a student to use, but the @CAPS3 will have many website and blogs for him/her to use. The third reason is for help. There are many website that can help a student to use for help in any subject. The @CAPS3 can help a student pass school. A @CAPS2 can help anyone from talking to someone to helping a student with science. That is how computers are good.
3	The setting affected the cyclist because the terrain you ride on can determine how you ride. For instance when you have hills and dry weather like they did when it said “flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills” The one easy terrain was now made more difficult and only added to his frustration and his dehydration from having no water. Also the heat contributed plenty and it was there the whole time.  Sometimes he didn’t seem to notice or feel it but it was there and it was taking energy from him: Like when it said, “The sun was beginning to beat down, but I barely noticed it.” He didn’t know it but that took from him so he drank more water and that affected his ability to take enough to complete the ride.
1	The cyclist was riding in the hot, desert. This made him thirsties and less active. The story says, &quot;The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips. Wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt.&quot;
0	My point of view that affect a cyclist that people need to recycle sometimes people is throwing away trash can with soda in side of it people cyclist now in days some times they need to change that role my conclusion people need to save stuff to make some new things to make a good quality world of cyclist things.
2	The cyclist listen to the geogers. after a while he starts to get tired. After the seenery desert change he starts to get mad. He criticizes himself for accepting advice from “old-timers who haven’t left the
3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. He always kept his head up and was determined to make it to his destination. The first problem was when he came to the “fork of sorts” as he put it. He needed more water, but the pumps were rusty and all he could get out of them was a tarlike substance followed by blackish water. He tested it, hoping it was better than it looked, but it wasn’t. It tasted like battery acid. He was very thirsty, but had to move on, looking for another water supply. Another problem that occured was, while he was becoming dehydrated more &amp; more by the minute and unsteady on his bike, a huge snake lay across the road. He had to slowly maneuver around it, though it was hard, he was successful and continued down the road. The third &quot;obstacle&quot; he ran into was he was so thirsty and finally had a chance for a drink, when to his dissappointment, he found an old abandoned welches grape juice factory. As nervie and upsetting as it was, he continued to move on, still determined to make it to his destination. He finally came up to a fishing supply store where he was able to take a break and get a nice drink! Even though the setting was tough, teasing, and ironic, the man made it through and still with a smile on his face.
1	Features of the setting affect the cyclist because of his enduranc. The amount of time he can ride without stopping, houever long he can ride up hill, how ever many bumps he rides over, however long he can ride without a drink of water.
1	The features of the setting affect the cyclist by the changes the occur while riding his bike. The cyclist began well with smily face, but then he changed because the condition of the road and the weather that was hot, also there was not any signal to show him where he was going and it was the correct way he was taking. Also, his bike flat needed to be replaced.
2	The features of the setting affected the cyclist by for the roads and heat has. He has tine ling through a desert in June which made it really hot for him, @CAPS1 that the road was bumpy and that made him have to pedal harder.  The @CAPS1 had to prit more effort into it because the romds here long and he had the spirit and determination to get to Yosemite. He @CAPS1 ran into a snake which told him that I am getting deeper into the desert.
3	The setting of the cyclist clearly influences his mood. From the beginning to end, the outside world reflects the tormils in his head. This is evident in the beginning reservoir, empty desert, hills the Welch factory, &amp; finally the fish camp. The reservoir is a heven, @NUM1 safe ground that contains everything the men needs. He is feeling optimistic, ready &amp; eager to follow advice of old men. He first hits a ghost town, which is foreshadowing a dangerous future. He passes through still with a level head. He comes to a water pump that gives him battery acid. This is wher the mood shifts. He suddenly describes his setting as “the high deserts of California.” The sun is boiling down &amp; water is running low. His hopes start to drop. When the “flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills,” it reflects the turmoil in his head. The terrain is harder the chances of his survival lessons. When he crosses a snake, it suggest even more despair. It finally climaxes at the Welch factory. How ironic, it is an abandoned juice factory. This is lost hope. When he finally arrives at the fish camp, he is relieved to be alive &amp; is uplifted. The cyclist has made it. It is clear the setting has affected the cyclist.
3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. He is riding his bike along the road and encounters a dilema.”… @CAPS1 weeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake. Blocked the… pavement in front of me.” He had to stop and into by the snake which showed him down and freaked him out. He had problems with thirst already and had to deal with a snake that “really did look like a diamondback.” @CAPS2, he sees a building up ahead and discovers that it’s a walrus Grape Juice factory. He thought that is might have some water but realized it was abandoned. Relating to his thirst, before he left he grabbed some pebbles.” I’d read once that sucking on stones helps takes your mind off thirst by allowing what spit you have left to circulate.” * @CAPS3 he came across a fishing camp and received instructions on how to go on. This affected him because he @CAPS3 got to a secure place and got proper directions and will learn from his mistake of listening to the older men at the beginning. The features of 
10	To use computors, or not to. That is the question. Hundreds of millions of people use computors in their daily life today, but some believe that using computors does not benefit society. It is my firm beleif that they do. Computors provide entertainment, a way to interact with people, and a nearly endless expand of knowledge. Without them, we would quickly find life to be much harder and less fun to navigate. Have you ever been in your house on a rainy day just sitting around bored because there is nothing on @CAPS1? Well I have on many ocations. When that happens, all you have to do is turn on the computer and you have endless choices at your fingertips. You can go on game sites and play thousands of different games. (this can also help improve your hand-eye coordination). You can also watch movies or @CAPS1 shows that you missed or want to watch again. You can even go on sites such as fanfiction.net, and read or write your own stories! Another reason why computers benifit society is that they help you interact with people. You can keep in touch with far away family members and friends using webcams email, and chat sites without the bill that would come with talking on the phone. You can also meet new people from different countries and become their. That way you learn about different ways of life and cultures. You can also quickly contact people in an emergency get updates on events, and comunicate with your teacher if you have a question about your homework. Lastly, and maybe even most importantly, computers are on enormous source of knowledge. Say you wanted to learn how to start a campfire, you could just search, &quot;how make fire&quot; a google and @NUM1 matches would be found seconds. Also, if you were asigned a project for school, you could do all of your research easily from your computor, then type the whole thing up on a word document. You can even get a college degree online if you wished. And if you want to find a resturant that specializesin @CAPS2 cooking, you can find one close to you, get directions to it, look at the menu, see the prices get the restaurant's history, cud find reveiws for it all on one magnificent little choice: your computer. So you see, computors benifit society greatly. In fact I don't think we could live without them. They provide us with entertainment, an easy way to interact with people, and a huge source of information. Now, to all of you people who still think computors are bad; I'd like to see you lost a week without using one.
1	The feature of the setting affect the cyclist by giving him hope that the finishing line is not far and there was nothing in sight no cars, building or stucture of any kind.
2	The author was affected in many ways be the conclusion. He was tired from the blazing heat, didn’t have much water, and got lost. Water simple was limiting and as he went farther and farther it seemed like thing would get worser and worser for him. A man had gave him the wrong directions and he probably hadn’t been off his porch in decades the author saids.
1	In the story the cyclist explains how the road goes from good to bad: An example,“ Rough road ahead: Do not exceed Posted Speed limit. Also the dry.
2	In the story, these are many elements that affected the cyclist in his journey.The first features of the setting that affects him is the old water pump, which did not work, and when it did the water from it lasted horrible. The next obstacles on his journey was rough terrain. &quot;Flat road  was replaced by short rolling hills,&quot; was how he described it. When the narrator finally finds a building, it turns out to be  abandoned. Eventually he finds a  town and rest after his long journey, and learns his lesson from before not to take advice from people he doesn’t know.
1	Well the features were rough desert like features. For a cyclist this terrain is difficult. For example the lack of water, and the battery acid flavor. These affected the cyclist in a major way.
3	'Not two miles into this next section of the ride, I noticed the terrian changing. Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills'' (Kurmaskie @NUM1). When the cyclist realized the terrain was becoming difficulty he become more ignorant and hopeless. ''Wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt; and the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June simply because I listened to some gentlemen who hadn't been off their porch in decades caused me to laugh. it was a sad, hopeless laugh'' (@NUM1). He wasn't goig to die, die but even though he was struggling, he made a big deal out of it. Unfortunately, the man lived. He would live on, telling people not to listen to old men. ''Never accept travel advice from a collection of old timerd who haven't left the confines of their porches since carter was in office'' (@NUM3). He was on a long, hot raod, and he started taking stabs at the old men ''I made a mental note to change that paragraph'' (@NUM4) The man was not forced to take direction from the old man. In his selfishness to cut back thos trip of only a few rough terrain, heat, and dehydration caused him to be hopeless,angry, and he felt sorry for himself.
2	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. One way is that the cyclist is traveling through the high deserts of California in June. Another affect said in the story was that the cyclist made it to a town where the water pump was all rusted and with all his strength, he worked the handle and got a tarlike substance followed by brackish water which he couldn’t drink. Also , the cyclist had been hitting his water bottles regularly. Lastly, the old-timers said the towns would be close when really they were far apart.
2	There are many things that can affect a cyclist's journey. This cyclist seemed to have bad wick. He starts off mentioning that he is planning a trip to Yosemite and the men that hear this give him a tip. The cyclist is pretty confident in what they tell him, so he follows their suggestions. He ends up getting lost. The cyclist is also travelling in the “high deserts of California in June.” That means that he is travelling in summer with dry air. When he gets to the first “town” he sees, he can it get the water he needs to rehydrate his body. He also runs into a snake while travelling through the desert, which slows him down. Because it’s hot, and he’s tired, he begins to see mirages that affect him. All of these features cause the cyclists to take one long, tiring journey through the desert. These features also taught him the lesson to not take advise from old men who have not left their porch because their information @MONTH1 be out of date.
1	Well the setting was the lil boy was on the bike and he meets this old man and the man toke him a short cut. So he took dis road and I guess something went wrong.
2	In the “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” by Joe Kurmaskie, the features of the setting affect the main characters, the cyclist. After he first journied from the house where he met the old men, he rode over much flat desert terrain, where the sun beat down and dehydrated him. Soon, though the terrain changed. “Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.” This tests his endurance even more as he has to maneuver down the hills while dehydrated and ready to collapse from exhaustion.
9	Dear @LOCATION1, I @CAPS1 believe that using computers has a benefit to the community. I believe this because using computers helps with research, jobs, and staying in town with people. First and foremost, the use of computers will tribute to better research. Most @CAPS2 dont have textbooks about @CAPS3 or @CAPS4 at home with them so they rely on the internet. When @PERSON2 gave the class a parket, I didn't know what some of the words meant. So i logged into my laptop and went on google, within seconds the definitions wore popping onto my screen like pop rocks. After I found out what the words meant, I finished my homework in about five minutes. Without the internet I don't know how long it would have taken. Equally important, using computers will allow a wider selection of jobs. @PERCENT1 of today's jobs in @LOCATION1 require some kind of computer work. some jobs require quick typers. some people type as fast as cheetah runs. Some jobs require people using @CAPS5 or @CAPS6 - Computers are a necessity to get a well - paying job. Lastly, using computers will open a gateway communication @CAPS7, @CAPS8, @CAPS9, etc are a few of the many ways to communicate online. if one of my friends doesn't have a phone, they most likely have a @CAPS7. @CAPS7 gives me a way to talk to, @CAPS11 photos with and leave videos for my friends. One @CAPS12 @PERSON3, @PERSON4, and I were all going to work on our @PERSON1 project. @PERSON3's phone was taken away so the only way I could talk to her was on @CAPS7. Did you know that @PERCENT2 of @LOCATION1 has a @CAPS7, @CAPS8, of @CAPS9? To @CAPS17, I hope you enjoyed reading about how using computers helps with research, applying for a job, and communicating with family and friends please @LOCATION1, @CAPS18 this in the Newspaper so all residents of @LOCATION1 will agree with me.
2	Hot, @CAPS1, @CAPS2-all are the features of the setting that affect the cyclist. First, the hot days with not a lot of water to drink. He will get dehydrated. Also, there is no one around to help him if he gets lost. Joe Kurmaskie explains “there was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structur of any kind. Finally the creature was a large snake that came along on road. So he had to move around it.
1	Seting is one of the most important neds for a cyclist if the terrein or weather are bad, the hotter it is for a cylist its ?? ??
1	The The features of the setting effect the cyclist because the cyclist @CAPS1 challenging porblem face by the author. Forexample, I nottice the terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills. After I had erected the first few things, a large highway. That’s shows when he arrived, the road does not good and also large highway high of jumped.
3	THE FEATURES OF THE SETTING AFFECT THE CYCLIST BY IT BEING SO HOT OUTSIDE THAT HE COULD HAVE HAD PASSED OUT AND DIED. ALSO HE SAW A SNAKE THAT SCARED HIM TO DEATH BUT HE PASSED THE SNAKE. ALSO HE SAW A BUILDING THAT COULD PROBABLY HELP HIM BUT IT WAS ABANDONED,IT WAS A WELCH FACTORY THEN AS HE RUNS FURTHER DOWN HE SAW A FISH PLACE AND WENT TO THE BATHROOM TO GET SOME WATER then somebody asked him where he was going and they tined totzy him but he still had his map so he decided that he was going to use it instead of listening to other people.
3	In the story “Rough Road Ahead” a cyclist takes some out of rate information from a couple of old guys as he went along following there directions he found out that there directions were out of rate and at points dangerous. Also the setting didn’t help because he was in a desert with ghost towns and it was very hot it didnt help him believe he was going to make it out alive. For example in the story when he enters the  fork in the road it says he found “several rusty pumps,” and “one ramshackle shed.” This probably didnt help him because he didn’t have alot of water left and it was really hot and he was losing confidence in himslef that he went get out and there were rusty pumps so he couldn’t get any water that was good. Also in the story it says that “There was no one in sight, not a bulding, car, or structure of any kind” and that setting affected him because in this part in the story he has cycled for a while and he has no water left and he is getting very exhausted a almost has no energy. Also it decreased his hopes because it says there wasnt a building, or a car anything so it was pretty, much a empty dessert that he was stuck in and he thought he wouldn’t setent of the dessert alive. In conclusion in the story “Rough road ahead” the setting in the story didn’t help the cyclist in his hope or confiendce of setting out because the setting was very abanded and also it was very hot and it didn’t help that he was in a desert.
1	Well since the cyclist is in a desert and out of mother he is probably not going to be happy. The &quot;ghost towns&quot; aren't really a boost of confidence either. The rugged hills made him angry too. The heat affected him the most.
1	The features of the land affect the cyclist in the many ways. For example, the first two buildings that he came to were abandond so he could not get any food or water. Also, he noticed that the terrain was changing from flat to rolling hills and this will put more strain on his legs. Finally, the land was hot and dry wich was making him dehidrated. This is how the features of the land affected the cyclist. 
2	In this story the setting affects the cyclist in many ways. He tries to get directions but the people he asked really didnt know what they were talking about. Thats why you have to be careful on who you ask. Then he needs a drink but that dosent work out to well because the water ends up tasting like battery acid. Then the cyclist begins to be on his way again and finds same difficulty in the road. The same difficulty in the road. The road is in bad condition and must do slower then the speed limit. At this point it felt like he was gonna die. Lucky he found a bathroom and drank from the sink.
3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in a few ways. Early in the essay, the syclist states he “enjoyed the serenity of an early-summer evening and some lively conversation with these old codgers.” The cyclist was enjoying himself and the  atmosphere, but then the mood changed quickly to doubt when he didn't listen to the “collection of old-timers who havent left the confines of their porches since Carter was in office“ and his depleting water source quickly became a cause for concern. Doubt was soon followed by @CAPS1 when he saw the sign for Gary and Wilber’s Fish camp and was able to get a drink from the bathroom foucets @CAPS1 was then followed by satisfaction when he “promised himself right then that he'd always stick to [the very good map] in the future.   
9	Dear @STATE1's newspaper editors I have recently read an atical that was talking about how experts are concerned that people are spending way too much time on their computers. Well I agree with them. I strongly belive that computers are tacking time away from you exercising enjoying nature and even interacting with family and friends. Well if you look at teen's this day and how more and more are becauming over weight like back in the days when their wasn't computer or internet not as much people were over weight or even obiste because they had time to go out and exercis or play sports with othes. Exercising is importent because espeshaly when as a teen you are over weight or even obiste well theis problems just don't go away this will cost you in the futer because not only do you have to chance of getting deobetice but you also have to pay for all the medications and treatments that comes with it. Experts also belives that by spending time on the computer will tack time away from enjoing the things that nature has to offer. When other might argue to it is a good thing for people to learn about the different types of place's in the world. Well I delive why do you have to just read about the places online and look of the picture why can't you be the one tacking the pictures for other to see. And why can't you be the one experincing it insted of just reading about it. Experts also believe that by spending time on the computer it is tacking away time from you being able to interacting with family members and friends. Well as a teen myself I have learned that by intercating with family and friends are vary important to our health. I am not the only person that agrees with that because study shows that kid that can talk to their perents and have good convercations with their parent have the ability to do well in school and have more respect towed others verces the the kid or teen that can't really have conversation or talk to their parents. For example if you are the type of person that talk to your family You will have good grades such as A's and @CAPS1's and will learn to have respect for other and the person that can't talk to their parents have troble concentrating or even macking troble fro themselfs and getting @CAPS2's and @CAPS3's. Well I know that as a @STATE1 newpapper editer you are a vary busy person and have lot of diffent things to do but I hope you take this in to concideration and remmember the importants of exercisin, enjoying rotune and interacting with familys and friends.
2	The setting had a bad affect on the author in many ways. One reason is that the heat of the setting caused the author become dehydrated. Dehydration is when your body begins to shut down due to lack of water. The setting also affected him by draining his confidence and making him seek out water. “I hung my head,” means that he was depressed. This proves that no matter who or what you follow there is always a possibility of death from any circumstances. Therefore this is how the author was affected by the setting he was biking @CAPS1.
1	I think the settings made it little more challenging to not letting give up also. Also shows that you do better in life when challenged.
2	The setting affects the cyclist because it is in a warm dry climate, causing him to sweat profusely, and requiring like to drink more water. When no one else was around, it is more difficult for him to continue, if there’s a chance that he is on the wrong path, and no body available to tell him otherwise. With only abandoned buildings, if any, water was unavailable, which made the journey more tiring and physically straining. If the setting were different, this story would not have been as traumatic.
3	THERE ARE VAST FEATURES IN THE SETTING THAT AFFECTS THE CYCLIST. IN SEVERAL WAYS ONE FEATURE WOULD BE THE “SUN BEGINNING TO HEAT DOWN,” AS THAT MADE THE CYCLIST HOT AND THIRSTY. THE THIRSTY-NESS REDUFROM HIM TO USE HIS LIMITED SUPPLY OF WATER. SO THE SUN WAS ABLE TO EFFECT HIM A COUPLE OF WAYS. ANOTHER FEATURE THAT CAUSED SOME PROBLEMS FOR THE CYCLIST WERE THE RUN DOWN “GHOST TOWNS” THAT CONSISTS OF “RAM-SHACKLE SHEDS” AND “SEVERAL RUSTY PUMPS.” THESE FEATURES LED THE CYCLIST TO FEEL HOPELESSNESS, AS WELL AS THE PROBLEM THAT THEY DIN’T HAVE ANY WATCH FOR THEM TO FEEL UP WITH AS HE BECAME DEHYDRATED.  OBSTACLES SUCH AS “TUMBLEWEEDS” AND “PAVEMENT BLOCKING SNAKES” ALSO PLAYS A ROLE IN AFFECTING THE CYCLISTS AS HE MOVE ON THE “@NUM1 ROAD” ONLY DOING “12 MPH.” ONE FINAL, AND LAST OBSTACLE WAS THE TERRAIN HE RODE ON.  THE OBSTACLE BEING A “LONG CROPPING HILL,” THIS MADE THE CYCLIST EXHAUSTED, AS HE USES MUCH ENERGY TO SUMMER THE HELL, HE WAS ??? ???? ??? ???
1	Topic: The features of the setting affect the cyclist. The features of the setting affect a cyclist or the major problem that a cyclist encounter are some rough road, inspection of the bike, putting on necessary equipment, do not exceed posted speed limit For a cyclist to be doing all this I don think there is going to be any features of the setting affect a cyclist. For a cyclist to maintaining the speed limit of @NUM1 or a water-depleting @NUM2: sometimes life can feel so cruel. At some point, tumbleweeds are caused by too much of speed but for them to be using the necessary equipment they won’t get seriously injured. Forget that old saying about never taking candy from strangers. No, a better piece of advice for the solo cyclist would be “Never accept to
3	The features of the setting really affected the cyclist. The author wrote of rough terrain and isolation. “Flat roads was replaced by short, rolling hills tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake”. After reading this information and the descriptions. I inferred that the author was alone in the desert with awful conditions. I go inferal a tone of resentment also. He seemed to wish he hadn’t taken the “shortcut” that landed him in the desert. The hot weather was another factor that affected the author, trying to keep my balance in a dehydrated state. He seems to have not really planned how long the ride would be and how to conserve water. The rough terrain desolation and hot temperatures seemed to have affected the cyclist / author.
3	The features of the setting that most affected the cyclist were the water pump, the Welch’s Factory, and the fish camp. The pump affected him because he was very thirsty, and at first he thought he would have a chance to get water, he was excited and he pumped the water out, as he wrote, “with all my strength.” @CAPS1 he had to go on thirsty, (a very risky thing to do while cycling) because “it had the flavor of battery acid.” Next, the Welch’s Factory affected him by killing his spirits. He was already feeling bad from the lack of water, but seeing the mocking, ironic image of “a sandblasted picture of a young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice”, made him feel worse. It reflected his own desperate situation, all refreshments in the past, there was nothing left. I had a similar experience once. I am alergic to peanuts. One time, on a long car trip, I had slept through lunch, so I was starving, and we were on a long stretch of highway with no buildings to be seen. After two hours, we finally saw a sign for a nearby restaurant: @CAPS2’s peanut shade. I nearly cried. The last thing that affected the cyclist was the fish camp. It saved his life. He arrived and &quot;drank deeply from the sinle.” He was so happy that he wanted to kiss the owners of the camp. This also relates to the car trip I mentioned, because after hours of hunger, we found a very good sush : bar, and sush: is my favorite food.
0	The story that I am doing the most was going to talk about what happen in the story I was not shore but the name of the story sound prety good if I was in the story I not be good becaus the story is really crazy I would be realy good two start and right
2	In the setting they are in lodi, California. That is a part of the desert. The desert effects the cyclist real bad. For one it is really hot. Two the heat is making him thirsty and is running out of his water. Then last he is near no towns so he can’t get anymore water, so the setting does effect the cyclist.
1	The cyclist is most affected by e heat. He is exerting all his energy and will to get to Yosemite. The hot sun and lack of water makes him very tired and causes him to use his energy inefficiently. At one point, he has to make sure the building is a mirage. It is so hot his mind could be playing tricks on him.
8	Dear @PERSON1, I'm sending you this letter on the behalf of the people that spend way too much time on computers. Some people @MONTH1 say that you learn different cultures and interact with new people everyday. The truth is that a computer doesn't help you; in fact it hurts you. By spending all day on the computer you will get fat, lose great experiences on the outside and miss out on life. As a whole @LOCATION1 is known as an obese country. This is due to the fact that most people eat and then dont exercise. Most of these obese people don't exercise because they are glued to thier computer. While interacting with others they just keep on eating, most dont even know why they're eating. If we want to erase @LOCATION1 as being an obese country, then we must get people away from their computer screens. It is actually our fault, because we aren't making a stand. We must show people just how bad the computer really is. Also, while people are on the computer they're missing out on the world. They won't go outside, they wont know what the real world is actually like. Imagine cthat being an adult and having no clue about the outside world. Also, the could miss out on life changing exercises the kind of experiments that people @CAPS1, they would miss out on life as a whole. We only have one life, so you better enjoy it. It would be so sad for someone to just pass through life being stuck on your computer screen. I truly feel bad for that person, then again it could be fixed. All that we have to do is take away the computer. If we do this then all the problems will be solved. Finally, if we get rid of computers we will be known as a new nation. Free from temptation and independent human beings. We will rewrite ourself in history as the that made a chane and got rid of computers.
1	The conditions that the cyclist was in was very horid as he continued on his ride he got hotter and hotter hoping to find water after he finished of his last bit. Taking advices from an old man was and his last decision he made.
2	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because sometimes, it made him lose some courage and optimism. “and the growing realization that I could drop from a heatstroke on a gorgeous day” This is an example of how he lost courage. I wanted to be brave and be strong. But the hot day and all the sweat made the author feel weak. “I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean, leaving only some expensive outdoor gear” This is an example of how the author lost some optimism. He didn’t want to die, but he kept telling himself that he was going to , he should have thought to himself that he was going it make it, but the setting was just to rough. There were bumps along his ride, and the sun beating down his thirst, he became less courageous and less optimistic.
2	The features of his journey are cruel. “Rolling hills,” make him work harder to get over them. The more he works, the more he sweats and therefore he needs fluids to do so. The lack of water he has does not help. Poisonous don’t really bother him if he leaves alone. The condition of the roads adds on to the hills. Rough roads make him work hard to get through and then over the hills. So this guy is getting it pretty rough.
2	Some of the features of the setting that affected the cyclist were the rough terrain and the hills. It says in  the reading “ flat road was replaced by short rolling hills” this would wear a person out without a good supply of water and is not sure in what direction he is travelling. And another thin g that affects him is the hot june weather in California.
2	Throughout “Rough Road Ahead: Do not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” the features of the setting affect the cyclist. The cyclist was traveling through a very dry area, where it was very hot, dry and dangerous. There was no water to be found and the terrain is were rough and bumpy. The speaker stated, “At some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously lareg snake...”  (Kurmaskie @NUM1).The cyclist fared land blockings and dangerous animals. This cause him to slow down a little bit. It was extremely not out in the setting he was in. The cyclist was in the deserts of California in June.The speaker stated, “@CAPS1 rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, the growing realization that I could drop from heat stroke on gorgeous day in June...” (Kurmaskie @NUM1). The cyclist was expirencing the high temperatures of the setting. The cyclist witnessed the intense  features of the setting.
2	The features of the setting effect the cyclist in many ways. He becomes delusional when he said that  if he were lucky one of the stones would be lodged in his throat. Also he is dehydrated because he uses all of his water tend is having to push hard to make it to the next town.
1	The features of the setting started out easy like a road thats flat cool lines to keep him cool and not hot. Then it sat harder lack of water road is not flat anymore snakes the cool pines are gone. 
3	In the story &quot;Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Limit,&quot; the features of the setting greatly affected the cyclist. As he was riding, he was passing through desert during June, a very hot month.There is not much water present in a desert (that would be part of the definition of a desert) and so, particularly in the even-hotter-than-normal June sun, he was at risk of running out of water. Had he been driving through, say, a forest or perhaps rolling grasslands, he might not have been in such danger, and could have merely looked for a river or dreck for water if he was desperate. Another thing that might have affected the cyclist would have been the affect of the desert on his mind. When people think of deserts they often think of dry, barren wastelands, complete with buzzards and maybe a dead cowskull, as in movies. Deserts are in intimidiating, they have a bad reputation and so, as he was riding through and was low on water thought of death how he was, &quot;going to die and the birds would pick (him) clean&quot; running through his now-teriffied head. Had he been in a city or in rolling farmland he might not have been as terrified. There are people in those places, and places to be safe there, but, in his desert, he had neither, allowing him to give way to despair. Setting does a lot to influence stories, so it is important to keep that in mind when reading. 
1	The features of the setting affected the cyclist because he was out of water in a desert like environment and their was no one ground for most of it so he was down on his own. The cyclist was affected when in the story when he says ''I got down on my hands and knees, working the water handle of the rusted water pump with all my strength. A tar like substaNce oozed out followed by brackish water feeling somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees. That affected him because, he was drinking a lot of water before he got to that point in his trip and he was almost out so he needed to fill up with more but he did not have a place to get more water. That is one of the features of the setting that affected him.
2	The features of the setting affect the cyclist by getting dehydrated, getting tired, and by getting lost. After the cyclist was on the road for a while he had drank almost all of his water, but he still had a while to go before he got to his destination. He was going to try to find some where to stop so he could pick up more water but there was nothing around. He also got tired because he was out in the sun, had barley any water, and he didn’t know where he was going. One last example was that he was lost. There were no cars, buildings, or people. So if he were to get hurt or sick no one would have been able to help him. In conclusion, being dehydrated, tired and getting lost were the features of the setting affect the cyclist had.
8	Dear newpapers journalist, People shouldn't have computers. Computers have a negative effect on most people. The @LOCATION1 has The highest number of obese citizens in the world. A lot of people spend their day sitting in front of a computer and work. Then they go home and go on their own computers instead of going for a walk or a bike ride. Some people like to look at photos of nature or birds on the internet, even though there's a whole forest outside. Another problem with computers is how safe they are. There are a lot of people on computers that don't belong there, and are trying to hack onto your computer. Viruses can sneak into your computer without you knowing it, and can look up eveything on your computer, even personal information. They can even monitor what your typing, which could be passwords! A lot of people have been paying their taxes online and if there is a virus on their computer, they could get their person's personal information! Plus, most people who pay their taxes online have to use their online bank accounts, so now. They have your bank account password too! Computers are bad for most people. They make people become unhealthy and can get their personal information hacked by a virus.
2	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because he runs out of water because he is trying to traverse the terrain. In the setting there is a desert in California that he is riding through on a bike, &quot;I was travelling through the high deserts of California” The word &quot;high&quot; means that there were hills which would make the journey even more difficult. The hills appeared later in the story as the cyclist said “flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.” When the speaker says replaced he is trying to show a change of terrain. another feature of the setting is the tumbleweed that he crosses other hills, “tumbleweeds crossed in path.” The tumbleweeds made him remember he was in the desert because tumbleweeds are associated with the desert which brought up the thought &amp; dying and being picked apart by birds.
1	Well if the setting relates to the theme then the story will make sence, like if it’s a sad story and it’s a ugly rainy day then it will match verry nice. That’s how the setting makes it better.
2	If it is hot Out you can dehydrate quickley. also, if is ff ong hand hilly you use a lot of energy. It can berough on equipment, body, and mind. Make sure you dress apropreit lyand carry lot so f water. Next, make sure your tiresa inflated and all equip is working properly. then, plan a good route that you can stopat places and catch a breath or some water. also, make sure you eat well, food provides a lot of energy.
3	In the setting of the essay; &quot;Rough Road Ahead: Do not Exceed Posted Speed Limit.&quot; had a great affect on the cyclist. It made him even more determined to finish because the terrain was so hard to ride through. For example, &quot;At some point, tumber weeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake-it really did look like a diamond back-back the majority of the pavement in front of me, I eased past, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state. &quot;The author fully explains how no matter how bad the obstacles are he comes across he keeps trying to easy on by. The terrain affect the character by keeping him determined. This happens to many people in their sports. For example in football they take any problems and use them as reasons to push themselves harder to finish the game. 
2	In the story the cyclist was affected. The cyclist was affected by the directions of the old man. It sas that they gave it to him to help him out. That it was a shortcut. I think the cyclsit thinks the directions are out of date. The reason think this is that in the second sentence of the story it says, &quot;never accept travel advice from a collection of old-timers who haven't left the continues of their porches since carter was in office.&quot; The feature of the setting also affected him because he had to ride upand down through what he though of as it, rough terrain. That is what I think affected the cyclist.
2	In Joe Kurmaskie’s “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” the features of the setting affect the cyclist alot. The terrain has a great deal to do with it. Also, the heat: First, the terrain affects the cyclist. It affects the cyclist because there is alot of hills. The text says, &quot;With what I believed was my last burst of energy, I maneuvered down the hill.” In order to go down a hill, you had to have gone up a hill. So, having to use the energy to pedal up hills affected the cyclist alot. Next, the heat affected the cyclist. I know this because the text says “and the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke.” This proves it is extremely hot outside. Heat would affect the cyclist because heat prevents you from functioning at your greatest ability. That is how the features of the setting in ‘Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” affect the cyclist. The terrain affects the cyclist because of the hills. The heat because it drains your energy quick. 
2	In “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not exceed posted speed limit,” the features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. One way it affected him is the towns were old and deserted. In the story he said “This place might have been a thriving little spot… but @CAPS1 it was a ghost town.” He could not get any water or any directions. The features of the setting affected the cyclist because the roads were bumby and there were many hills. “Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.” @CAPS1 the cyclist had to use all his power to manuever over the hills. The third reason why the setting affected the cyclist was the weather and that it was a desert. “I was traveling through the deserts of California in June.” He was hot, sweaty and thirsty. He was also tired and desperate to find water and town that was not deserted. The features of the setting affected the cyclist in “Rough Road Ahead: Do not exceed Posted Speed Limit,” by the roads, deserted towns and the lack of water.
1	In the story “Rough road ahead do not exceed posted speed limits,” The setting is a long road with “no one in sight not a building, car or structure of any kind he cyclist could be affected by the rough road that he have to ride down.
3	In the essay by Joe Kurmaskie, he describes his experience of bike riding in the desert. The setting affects the cyclist in many ways throughout the writing. At first, Kurmaskie is confident as he listens to a group of old codgers giving him advice. The setting is calm and happy and Kurmaskie writes that he “enjoyed the serenity of an eary-summer evening”. The word “serenity” gives the affect of calm and peace. However, as Kurmaskie proceeds into his journey, the setting changes. He is troubled by the “ramshackle shed, several rutsy pumps, and a corral that couldn’t hold the lamest mule” in a ghost town that he meets in the desert. Even later, the terrain changes and he sees a sign stating “Rough Road Ahead”. Kurmaskie’s confidence turns into even deeper doubt and worry as his water supply runs low. Finally, kurmaskie sees a sign for a fish camp. Here, his hope returns as he finds a “rather modern bathroom” where he can stop to get a drink. As the setting changes, Kurmaskie’s confidence is followed by determination and then relief.
1	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because he is in a dessert like place with a water surfage and he could hard tired. I would never have asked old people, he should have ask someone that was in charge of a store, because those people get asked many times. also he could have died if that snake got him or from what he said “heatroke.”
8	@ORGANIZATION1, I would like to tell you computers are very helpful in our society today. Have you ever needed to know something about a state or a place that brought up nig news &amp; you needed to get it? Were did you turn to? I know not a book, but to the computer. Without it how were you going to get your info. I think computers are benefitial to our society because it can help you learn and it could tell you when or where to sign up for activities. People interact with others different countries, states, &amp; or continents. Next, is how computer could benefit our society. Computers could help us learn by searching up research for a paper or even expanding our general knowledge. For instance today my class &amp; I are going to the @ORGANIZATION2 @CAPS1 to look up info on seat belts on buses. Without computers my class &amp; I couldn't have get it done without the computers. If we had books, it wouldn't have been enough to give to us all &amp; that would mean we would have to share. With sharing some kids @MONTH1 have hogged the books for a long time not allowing the other kid to get the info needed to do the paper, which would lead to a civil dispute in the classroom those two. With computers we have enough for each kid in the class. And, computers could help with gaining more general knowledge quicker. With gaining more general knowledge you become smarter. Next, computer can help set up activities. Computers could help go sign up for activities like baseball, football, basketball, or a gym. With the help from the computers you don't waste time going to the gym signing up, while you could do it at home. Maybe there's a waiting list to enter. You would've known that if you signed up online. For instance my little brother plays baseball &amp; my parents signed him up online. All they had to do was to take him to the place to sign up &amp; show that. I live in the town of @LOCATION1, while others had to sihn up, register, &amp; pay. All of that could've been done online like my parents didnt with the understanding of why computers could be helpful to society by being able to gain knowledge &amp; able to sign up for activities. Do you see why we need them for everyday life or just to get around? Computers are benefitial to our new up &amp; coming society!
3	The story begins as the author, a cyclist, has taken directions from several very old men to reach his bike-ridden destination of Yosemite National park. He starts out confident enough and then reaches the first town the gentleman described. It is a ghost town and amuses the author still believing he’s perfectly fine he sets out again this time arriving at a place with “One ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps and a corral that couldn’t hold in the lamest mule” It is at this point that the author starts to worry as his water supply is low. He preceeds past rolling hills, snakes, tumbleweeds and different land-marks. Each one rips his confidence and exciterent to shreds. Especially the juice factory as the author is currently very dehydrated and losing all hope. Finally, he arrives at the water he seeks in the form of “Gary wilber’s fish camp,” and refreshes himself and his dried-out hope. Each time the author passed a land-mark his confidence took a beating, and even though he was in dire physical health not having any hope for his sunny breezy vacation can drain a person even more from the inside out.
1	The features of the setting affected the cyclist negitvly because he was in the desert in the summer with little water and no stones too get a drink at, For example he says “There was no one in sight not a building, car, or structure of any kind's. This explains how his setting affected him because he had no where to go or get a drink. That is my reason why the cyclist settings where negitve.
2	The features of the setting affected the cyclist in bad ways. The rocky road and steep hills made him peddle harder. The old people made him go through the rocky way. The temperature from the desert made him thirsty so he ran out of water fast, He said “When I tried a drop or two, it had the flavor of battery acid.” The heat could have killed him anytime. For example “Wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that I could drop from the heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June.” This ride this man took to Yosemite was a very dangerous ride.  
2	The settnig can greatly effect the cyclist. The palce can change what happens and how it happens. For example if the story had taken place in alaska the cyclist would not have had, &quot;Wide rings of sweat circling my shirt.&quot; and instead have been fighting off hypo thermia. The setting is very important because it affects all of the details in the writing. 
1	At first the terrain was fine and he confident. But when he reached the first town it looked like one of those ghoust towns in the movies. The next town didnt come up when he was told it would. The terrain was that of a desert no water for miles. But he stayed determind. And he made it to some water though.
1	The features of the setting affected the cyclist in “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit.” For example, he finds a “ramshackle shed” and tries to find water. It affected him, because it says, “I got down on my hands and knees, working the handle of the rusted water pump with all my strength. A tarlike substance oozed out, followed by brackish water feeling somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees.” The quote meaning that he was determined to find water and perhaps anything.
1	The setting affected the cyclist by depriving him of hydration and weakening him. The large hills and rough roads ebbed away every bit of his strength and wore him down. The narration states, “Over one long, crippling hill” (kurmaskie @NUM1). This work choice reflects the writer’s feeling about his adventure. Words like “long” and “crippling” show that the trip was a horrible experience.
3	Pride, determination, relief – all are things that the cyclist felt during his long bike ride. First the cyclist started of rideing on fresh legs and good directions, but after a while down the road he started to dought the old men, “a diary with my last entry in place of old men, their wisdom, and their been a sense of direction, I made a mental move to change it.” After feeling that the direction might be rough, he rode out of pride to get to his destination. Next the rider had great determination to get to his destination and did many things, “I gathered – a few pebbles and stock them in my mouth to take my mind off of thirst.” This quote shows that he would do almost anything to keep going. Finally the cyclist was fatigue when he arrived at the @CAPS1 shop because he then knew the old men were right and would reach his destination, “As I stumbled into rather modern bathroom and drank deeply from the sink this quote shows he was polite naturally to get water but to know the men were right.
1	The features of the setting affect the cyclist when he was thirsty. “A sand blasted picture of a young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice in his mouth could be seen.” This proves that the rider was thirsty because in the paragraph before this talks about him having a last burst of energy going down a hill. And he was also sweating a lot. And also wiping sweat from his eyes. 
1	I work better when I can feel the  environment.  I think  the some goes  for  cycling  in  the  mountain , fresh air and no worries  on  you  mind them  cycling can become fun like the climates into the easy he even the fresh air,  the fine trees and the environment  makes him feel  better  so for cyclist environment plays a vital role.
10	Dear Local Newspaper, Have you ever forgot the book you needed for homework? Did you ever miss the newest episode of your favorite show? Well, all these things and more can be solved by using the computer. The computer gives us all the things we need. Whether that's information, games, or online friend chatting websites. The computer is necessary for our society today. Countless times I was in desperate need for information. If I'm doing a school report on animals. I can just go on the computer and search whatever I want. There's no more need for driving to the town library and then searching through countless books and encyclopedias. I just think that that is a waste of time, when you basically have everything you need twenty foot away. And it's in your house! There is no more need to search for hours through biographies. If you need to know state capitals, you can find it in no time. To me, that's a life saver. Not only can computers help you with information, it can make school projects so much easier. In my own experiences, I've needed pictures on school projects. Instead of drawing it, the internet can save time and effort. All you need to do is print out the pictures! However, if you have an essay that's, let's say, supposed to be ten pages who wants to write all that? With a computer, you can type it out in half the time. Then, when done, you can print it, or even send it straight to your teacher. But, if it's not finished, you can save it on a thumbdrive, and use it on any computer you want. All in all, that's a huge help. My final reason why computers are good, is that they serve instant pleasure. Computers have millions of games that a kid can play for free. Also, it has many website, like @CAPS1, or @CAPS2, that let you interact with friends. If you need to tell them something, there is no need for a phone. Plus, if you miss certain shows, or want to watch music videos, there are websites for that. As a kid, I'm usually never home because of sports and school activites. If I miss something on @LOCATION1, it is almost definitely going to be on the computer. You don't have to wait a week or so before they replay that episode. Who wants to do that? In the end, I think computers benefit people around the world. No more driving to libraries, or going out and buying games. The computer has everything you want for free. Basically, I think the computer is a huge time and effort saver that every household needs. It definitely benefits society.
2	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in a major way. The setting affected the cyclist performance. For example, the harsh temperature started to make his pedaling sluggish. The settings also made the cyclist a little frightened for instance, the cyclist came across a snake that he was terrified of. Again the settings affected the cyclist by tempting him. For example, the river tempted the cyclist to stop riding and go get a drink of water. In conclusion, the setting had a major affect on the cyclist.
3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. For one, a lot of the settings discoured the cyclist. “This place might have been a thriving little spot at one time- say, before the last world war- but on that morning it fit the traditional definition of a ghost town. As soon as the cyclist hits this “town” he realizes that the old mens advice might not have been so great. The dry desert affects the cyclist the most. This hot climate makes the cyclist extremely thirst, hot, and and sweaty. “Wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that I could drop from a heatstroke...” The cyclist's tune here is sarcastic but he is still concerned about his health because of the heat and lack of water. The fact that there is nothing living around the cyclist also affects him. Since he’s talked to the old men for directions he hasn’t seen a glimpse of life, or buildings or anything. So this definetly discourages the cyclist and makes him lose his will to continue his journey. In conclusion, the features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. 
2	The cyclist traked through a barren land trying to get to a land of rivers and valleys. Trakling through the first town the cyclist saw a ramshackie shed, rusty pumps and corral lotated in the desert of California. The cyclist was very angry that the old men led him into this barren town, however he kept hope and traveled to the next town. Their, he found a abandond fruit juice factory and bottling plant, how the discuraged the cyclist started to give up. “I was going to die,” he clamed with all hope loot. The man feels like their is nothing left and it’s the old men who caused this. Then finally, he cme across a bait shop which he found an his own giving him a huge reliefe. The features effects his attitude because in a baren land you lose hope as did the cyclist. Therefore, what’s around us affect us as in education, friendship, and survival.
3	In the essay, “Rough Road Ahead: Do not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,'' the cyclist is affected doth emotionally and physically by the features of the setting. At the start, when he came to a deserted shed with rusty pumps, he began to feel discouraged. “[The] sight was troubling,”(page @NUM1) @CAPS1 on in the essay, the terrain changes from flat land to short, rolling hills and tumbleweeds began to pass. The cyclist is definitely affected by the change in terrain. He is now exhaugnted but continues to pump his legs and ride on. Before the end of his ride, the cyclist reaches an abandoned @ORGANIZATION1. The setting how includes a large picture of a young boy drinking a refreshing glass of juice. The author seems almost detected by this. “I hung my head'' (page @NUM2) he confessed. In the end, once he finds an old fishermans store, he is relieved seeing the store from a distance excited the author, because, he could finally have a drink. The author mood and body were greatly affected by that features of the setting.
2	The features of the setting in “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” by Joe Kurmaskie show that as the day goes on the cyclist becomes tired and wornout from his long ride through rough terrain trying to find his way back home then he saw some buildings down a hill and said “With what I believed was my last burst of energy, I maneuvered down the hill” (kurmakie @NUM1). After the rider gets home he says he is going to do it again.
2	The main affect is the lack of water. It is in June, while riding his bike in California. Therefore it’s going to be very hot and he’ll need a lot of water t stay hydrated. When he sees that Welch’s Grape Juice factory, it just makes him think of his thirst even more. Also the terrain he is riding is not the easiest. He starts out riding on flat ground but then is riding on hills and not so flat terrain. This doesn’t help his dehydration. That’s why you should always carry a lot of water with you if you’re riding a bike during the summer
1	The affects of the settings was how hot it was and the cyclist road he was on. The rider said it was June in the summer time, very hot. And the roads were not smooth, the were very old and ragady.
1	In the short story “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” a cyclist is going against heat lack of water and rough hills trying to maneuver around.
2	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because he is tRying to bike up hills and down hills, which can be very tiRing. Also, the hot aiR can dehydRate him, which can cause him to pass out. Along with the dRy aiR, theRe is dRy land, which means theRe is no place to stop foR wateR oR take a @CAPS1. The Rough @CAPS2 make the biking naRaeR because it involves moRe eneRgy than biking on a smooth path. Finally, the snake in the  middle of the Road made it haved foR the bikeR to go aRound. If the snake would have bitten him he could have died fRom poison.
1	The setting in the essay &quot;Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” was very hot in dry, very little shade or moisture, at some point maybe even none at all. This whether affected the author because he had no water at all so he was getting more dehydrated the further he went.
8	Dear @ORGANIZATION1, In the past ten years, advances in technology have completely changed the world. Technology makes peoples lives much easier and helps keep more and more people connected throughout the world. More jobs are created and help speed up ordinary events such as taxes, messages, news, and teaching. However, many people have proven that too much use of technology can make teens and adults addicted to the internet. In this addiction many people can lose time with their family, time to exercise and enjoy nature. Since being part of the generation growing up in the new technology era, I have had a first hand experience with the benifits of the new technology. I believe that this technology is a great help to society today. Many more jobs are being created because of this technology. For example, think about how many people could be employed if a new computer system was created. There would be thousands of people working on many things such as the founder, manager, creater of new ideas or just working at the new companies retail store. Running a business or a corporation is a very difficult job to do. But because of the advances in technology, running a business can become much easier and not as much time is wasted. With the new technology, people can send emails within seconds instead of running around the entire office giving out memos. Also for businesses, their stocks of the company can be updated every minute. These advances will make easier to run and make them more efficent. With the advances in technology average people can be updated on the new around the world every minute. Also when it comes time to pay taxes, fill them out and pay on line. None the less, there is more entertainment open to everyone. Through todays new technology, peoples lives are made much easier. They can work faster, get more arrands accomplished, learn more, connect to people around the world, and be caught up with local and international news. Technology is benifiting society and will hopefully continue making life easier.
8	Yes, I agree with the concern that expert have. I say this because its true people get on the computer for a long time and forget about their family, there is also all kinds of danger online, and lastly your brain is not getting enough work out. Don't you think all of this is true? Well, then if you still don't believe me I'll prove it to you. First, people get addicted to the computer they forget about there family. Insted of beign on the computer just looking for stuff like myspace or facebook, but they should spend time with their families playing games like @CAPS1, @CAPS2, or @CAPS3. I say this from a personal expirience, it wasn't me it was my cousin @PERSON1 he got addicted to the computer so much that everytime his family tried to do something fun together they would always end up fighting because he didn't want to go. Secondly, people can be facing major danger online, for example when you got to those chat sessions where you meet people supposley your age, but it might not always be that way everytime on the news you see stories where old people try act like @NUM1 year olds, but they aren't they just want to do bad stuff. So you can be facing a lot of dangerd online. Lastly, by beign on the computer your not letting your brain get the good workout or exersice it needs. Your just letting it be there, but instead you can be reading a book or do a word seach puzzle; these are all good idea for making your brain exersice. On a recent research experts say that people spend time reading and exersicing their brains do very good on test, but people who spend most of the time in the computer fail test. So don't you think I'm right? Don't you think that if you spend to much time on a computer you have less time with your family. You can be facing serious danger, and your brain is not getting the exercise it needs. Did I convinced you yet?
1	How the features of the setting affected the cyclist. The feature was that you should never take advice from old people that never get out of the house. For example in the story it says, “Never accept travel advice from collection of old. times who haven’t left confines of their porches since carter was in office.” This affecting the setting because if it weren’t for his map and let them take a peek at it, That would of saved him a load of trouble.
2	In “Rough Road Ahead: Do not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” by Joe Kurmaskie the setting of the terrain was hot and water draining. In the text it says “Followed by blackish water feeling somewhere in the neighborhood of two-hundred degrees” this proves that the cyclist is exagerating about the very hot temperature of the high deserts of California. The setting is also water draining and had to stop in the desert town to refill his water bottle as in the text says “I got down on my hands and knees, working the handle of a rusted water pump with all my strength.” This proves that the cyclist had to stop for water and using much power to pump it out. In conclusion always prepare for the worst but hope for the best. 
3	In the story, there are many features of the setting that affect the cyclist. One setting feature is the rolling of steep hills. The hills make the cyclist exhausted and even more desperate for water. For example, in the story it says, “Over one long crippling hill, a building came into view”. This shows that the hill was very hard and strenuous to get over. By using the word crippling it informs us that the hill was brutal and very hard to get over. Another setting I feature that affects the cyclist is the absence of any civilization on his cycling path. While he was riding he notices that there is nobody around to help him if he gets in trouble or needs water. The absence of people makes him feel stressed and worried about his journey. It shows this in the story when he say, “There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind”. Also it says in the story “I was going to die and the bird would pick me clean, leaving only some expensive out door gear and a diary with the last entry on the parse of old men&quot;. This shows that there was nobody around to help him and he knew it. He thought he would die alone and that birds would eat him. He was obnonely worried about the absence of people.
3	Usally the features, setting has an major affect upon the cyclist. The features, setting relates, and describes the hassh, and eventually relief condition of the cyclist. The setting relates to the person and plays a role, which the cyclist can observe. One reason how the features of the setting affects the cyclist is it shows the various problems that are being faced with the cyclist. For example, the cool pines, no one in sight, and I am alone. The way how this interepts a clear meaning, I the cyclist needs help getting home, and eventually by traveling, he needs water, to fill his thirst. Prior to thisy, the features, shows the weakness of the cyclist. For example, with that i believed it was my last burst of energy, as I consently, maneuvered down the hill. The features, and settings, affect the cyclist by showing how he was facing his troubles, thirst and fear, which all lead behind him at the end. These features and settings develop a clear understandmet, for the cyclist, and what is to be expected, in by him.
3	The features of the setting had a big impact on the cyclist. When he started that ride, he was confident that the “old timers” were right about which directions and roads he had to take to get to Yosemite National Park. Though the sun was bearing down, he refused to give up, just as he says” The sun was beginning to beat down, but I hardy noticed.” He came up to places that were worn down and deserted, so he knew he was alone if anything happened. The desert heat had made him down his water pretty regularly, so he tried to get more, as in, &quot;I got on my hands and knees When l tried a drop or two, it has the flavor of battery acid&quot; paragraph @NUM1. He was so thirsty that he would drink hot water. Then he thought he has only @NUM2 miles to go, so he kept going. He weakening as he pedaled along the changing terrain as he was “trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state. “With what little energy he had last, he had passed an abandoned Well be Grape Juice factory, which probably tested his patience and sanity. He had resorted to, “gathered up a few pebbles and stuck them in my mouth” just to keep his mind his thirst. He was losing hope when he came upon “ Gary and wilber’s fish camp best bet” then he felt relieved after he was able to get cool water. By then he's learned his lesson, to stick to his map.
3	In the author's recollection of his long and tiresome bike ride he talked about the struggles he had to face. when he set out that morning he asked some old guys on a porch for directions to @CAPS1. They told him that they knew the way and that they knew a shortcut. He choose to take their advice but later regreted it. when he found the towns that they spoke of all he found was ghost towns. &quot;Never accept travel advice from a collection of old-timers who haven't left the confines of their porches since carter was in office. &quot;He dose eventually reach a town were he finds signs of life. There he asks another old guy if he knows the way to Yosemite, the guy says he has a good map. All along his ride he was pleged by the sun and lack of watrer. The sun made him hot and thirsty which forced him to drink a lot of his water. when he rached his last few sips he resisted from drinking it and began loosing consciesness. &quot;I could drop from heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June.&quot;
1	A cyclist can only travel as fast as slow as he pedals. If the setting is a humid sunny day he can’t go to fast due to his lung capacity. If it is a warm but windy day he has to wath his speed to keep from getting hurt. Basically unless the weather is nice or safe enough he will go fast. But his safty care first so it depend on the weather mostly but also the time of the day. If it is night [dark] the reflectors must be put on to keep from getting it.
1	The features in the setting affecting the cyclist because of the heat and the terrain. I say this because in the story it describes all the hills that he has to go up and down with the herendous heat beating down on him. The heat also makes it hard because it makes you drink more and throughout the story he was trying to find some water, and the water he did find was about “two hundred degrees and tasted like a battery acid.” If you have no water that makes it very hard to bicycle that far of a distance in that much heat.
1	The cyclist is affected by many features in the setting. the long hill is one example the snake and the dirt road are two more. The heat of the desert is another and his depleting water supply are all examples of features that affected him.
1	There were many features of the setting that affeced the cyclist. One page @NUM1 paragraph @NUM2 there is a sign that states rough road a head. One page @NUM1 paragraph @NUM4 it says &quot;over the long onpiling hill.” He also the tempature as started on page @NUM5 and at the top of page @NUM1 paragraph @NUM7 “ l was travling in hing desertd of california in June. These conditions of the setting all effect the cyclist.
8	I would like to state on my behalf that I do not agree that computers are good for society. There are three reasons why I do not agree. Many people will not enjoy the outdoors, @CAPS1 people will spend @CAPS1 there time on the computer, and a lot of people will gain wheight to inactivity. When you sit on a computer you dont get off of for a while, why, because you are haveing fun. when you are haveing fun you will not stop wat you are doing, @CAPS2 dont pay attention. Eventually you will get hooked and play on the computer rather than go outside and have fun with your friends. @CAPS4 will just take up all of your time. @CAPS2 when you are bored you find anything that you can possibly do, rather than be bored. Many people are thinking this is a good time to go on the computer but @CAPS3 you bored you will stay on the computer until you have something to do. My mother always tells me when im bored not stay home because @CAPS4 will get worse. There is always something you can do that dosn't you just have to look harder. My last reason is that when you sit at a computer and you are fingers, you gain your wheight you I read @NUM1 children in every years will be obese, not because @CAPS4 runs in the family but because of inactivity. Inacitivity means not active activity. @CAPS3 you calories you will gain weight @CAPS6 wheight is unhealthy and you can stop the problem by just finding something spend your whole life on the computer. In conclusion you @MONTH1 have mixed thaught's @CAPS3 you ever want to go on the computer all the time. @CAPS4 doesnt matter @CAPS3 you go on just dont all the time. But remember my reasons why not to spend too much time. You will not enjoy the outdoors, find something else to do when you are and you will gain wheight @CAPS3 you spend all your time on the computer. 
2	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in this story. First of all, in the story it says “…and the growing realization that I could drop from a heatstroke…” (@NUM1). This quote shows that it is extremely hot and it is affecting his riding. The narrarator also says, “I eased past trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state”(@CAPS1 @NUM2). This quote is saying that he is dehydrated in is having trouble keeping balance on the rough terrain. In conclusion, the setting affected the cyclist in this story.
1	The setting affects the cyclist by wanting to go longer and riding the bike. And to see what is up ahead. By riding a bike in the heat, you can have a heat stroke and die from dehydration and the heat. That’s why you are supposed to have a lot of water with you when you are riding a bike.
2	THE CYCLIST SETTINGS HINDER HIM IN THE ESSAY “ROUGH ROAD AHEAD. THE CYCLIST IS IN THE DESERT IN THE SUMMER TIME WITH HARDLY ANY WATER. HE IS TRYING TO FIND HIS WAY TO YOSEMITE, BUT HE GETS LOST ALONG THE WAY BECAUSE SOME OLD MEN GAVE HIM BAD DIRECTIONS. DURING THIS TIME HE IS RIDING HIS BICYCLE FOR MILES AND MILES IN THE HEAT OF THE SUMMER. HIS THOUGHTS OF THIRST GET IN THE WAY OF HIM TRYING TO CONTINUE ON TO FIND YOSEMITE. I BELIEVE THAT IF THE CYCLIST WAS IN A COOLER ENVIRONMENT THEN THINGS WOULD HAVE BEEN DIFFERENT BECAUSE HIS SETTINGS WERE SORT OF A DISTRATION TO HIM
3	The cyclist became very tired and the area he was in did not help at all. he was in the desert in june very hot day and every town he had come to was abandoned and had no water. It was also very hilly which made the work even harder. 
3	The features in the setting of &quot;Rough Road Ahead, Do not Exceed Posted Speed Limit&quot; affect the cyclist because the determine how easy or hard he ride is for the cyclist. For example. The land being hot, would enable him to die or heat struck without water, the land being dry means he doesn’t have a place to refill his water supply and the land being barren means to the man that if he didn’t be of heat stroke there is a chance he wouldn’t be found and wouldn’t survive. Another example of how the features of the setting offer the cyclist is in the story when the road gets rough and he sees the speed time sign his though are about here he is going a water depleating 12 mph. This shows that he features of the setting, namely the contour of the land and the roughness or he road make the journey a lot harder on the cyclist. The features of a setting could possibley be the biggest arrest on a cyclist, and whether they have a long hard journey in which they have to push themselves to the limit like in this story or a nice lersury ride.
2	The cyclist “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” was definatly affected by the setting. He was cycling in California - which is a hot place to begin with - in June - which made it even hotter coming upon a hot desert. When you’re doing a physical activity like that, the last thing you want is to be in the heat. The narrator only brought one bottle of water which at first he was drinking regularly. Then it started to get hot and he was out of water. This affected his body by making him tired, and his mind because he started doubting himself. Then there was the abandon juice building where they made juice. He said “In an ironic twist abandon years earlier had been a Welch’s grape juice factory and bottling plant.” He was dying of thirst and then he found the bottling plant. The cyclist was definatly affected by his surrondings both mental - by saying “I’m going to die.” - and physically by becoming dehydrated.
3	The cyclist was riding in some rough, dry and abandoned terrain that made his journey almost fatal. He described it as, “In the high deserts of California in June.” It was dry, lifeless and hot The sun was beating on him and he needed to frequently drink water, but he was running out. The empty towns were what he was wanting on for fresh water, but they’d been very abandoned. This made his journey very dangerous. He could’ve fallen off at any time because of heat stroke He would’ve died right then and there. His sweat was drying in the heat and there was no way for him to cool off in the lifeless desert: lifeless and dry. He had to enhance these extreme. Ironical conditions for miles on end, just to find some water. It was all that a desert is and all that a home shouldn’t go through.
1	The features of the setting affects the cyclist in manyway. The hills are to long. Every town is fear appert and the rodes are rought. The heat also affectes him. He is affected health wise.
1	When your doing any sport or any thing were you sweat your setting is everything. If your sweating in a setting you can easily get sick. The setting from the story Rough road ahead the cyclist had no water and the setting was very hot. Thats why the cyclist was tired and sick because he was sweating and had no water. Thats how the setting affect the cyclist.
2	The features of the setting affect the cyclist  greatly. The features is old abandon towns and hot temperatures. Also abandoned buildings. This makes the cyclist think All hope is lost. The essay says this “Over one long crippling hill, a bulding came into view [...] I hung my head that smoky blues tune &quot;summertime rattle around.&quot; Then to a happy mo In an ironic twist that should please all sadist reading this, the building [...] by the looks  afit had been a welch’s  grape Juice factory and bottling plant [...] I hung my head that smoky bluees tune sumertime rattle around.” Then to a happy mood it states “As I stumbled into a ra ther modern bathroom and drank deeply from the sink, i had a overwhelming  urge to seek out Gary and Wilber, kiss them.&quot;  
7	In my opinion I think that computers have nothing to do with people having lack of exercise or sleep. I think it is all the persons decision to be on the computer as long as they want. The person on the computer obviously does not care if they sleep or not. When people are on the computer I think they dont play as much and start to get fat but that its their decision. Also when the time comes they going to realize that they need to spend less time on the computer and exercise. However, they need a time limit to be on the computer and limited time for eating right and exercising. Being on the computer @NUM1 people dont get the chance to interact with their family and friends because they want to be lazy and stay on the computer. The family and friends get angry and dont want to hang out anymore and within a couple of months they have no friends. Nature is good smells good, looks good, and computers make people stay inside all day! I think we should have more time outside. Also computers sometimes make kids want to not clean their room, not do chores because they are addictid to the computer.
1	With no one around and rough road ahead not to mention dehydration the cyclist begin to feel he was going to die. Because of this he began to dout himself but each time he saw something he tried to get there.
3	The features of the setting greatly affected the cyclist. For one, he was biking through the high deserts of California in June. This caused the cyclist to become overheated ad sweaty. So he drank from his water bottles frequently. Unfortunately, since there was, “no one insight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind,” he had nowhere to fill his bottles and become dehydrated. To make matters worse, the terrain changed from flat road to “short, rolling hills”. Normally, this would not cause too much struggle, but since he was dehydrated and overheated, each hill seemed “crippling”, My thoughts are that if the setting had been a bit cooler and perhaps on the time period the old men had lived in, the cyclist would have had a much more enjoyable experience.
2	Excitement, desperation, and self-pitty are all feelings the cyclist had because of the setting. He was really excited to get to Yosemite park because of it peacefulness. He said, “the cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite are calling my name.” He wanted to get their because it was so hot. He started getting desperate for water, so he drank out of this hot water hole. “I tried a drop or two, tasted like battery acid.” He was running out of water so he got desperate for some. He started to have self-pitty on his self,” sometimes life can be so cruel,” he was feeling pitty on himself because he had such a long way to go still. These are all feeling the cyclist had because of the setting.
2	Features of the setting affect the cyclist’s moods in many ways. The story says. “About fourty miles into the pedal, I arrived at the first &quot;town.” &quot;The cyclist is probably allready tired from pedaling for fourty miles. Then he finds out that the town is desserted, which makes him a little frustrated. The next few stops are also desserted and he is almost out of water. He is becoming desperate. The road becomes bumpy and there is a large snake blocking the way. He is terrified. Finally, he reaches a bait shop with cool water ,and he is relieved. As you can see, the cyclist goes though many moods caused by the setting of the story.
2	The way the feature of the setting affected the cyclist is that  its in June in the middle of the desert. Also he was given wrong
2	The cyclist was affected by the climate, the people, and the surrounding. The climate was the desert in June which was very hot with little water. This made him dehydrated and miserable. The old men that “helped” him acused think to be in the guiding situation he was in. There were no surrounding shop or buildings that were inhabined. This way there was no place for him to get any water nouroushment.       
3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist by when the story says “Twenty miles up the road. I came to a fork of sorts”, This statement from the story affected the cyclist because he didn’t know which way to go. Another feature that affected the setting is when the story says “I got on my hand and knees, Working the handle of the rusted water pump with all my strength”. That statement shows that the cyclist was dieing for water and he didn’t think any was going to come out. Last feature that affected the cyclist was when the story says “Rough road ahead: Do not exceed posted speed limit. This shows that the rider had to go under a speed limit but he was earlier tired and he was going way under it and that he could make it up the rough road.
2	The dry, deserted area the cyclist is in, has many caations and
3	In the text, the author was cycling to Yosemite park through a desert which dehydrated him and changed his mood. Going through this desert he ran out of water so he stopped. Some of the  towns he was told of which turned out to be deserted, and as he could not find water there he soon because dehydrated. This is the obvious affect the setting had on him, another affect was to cause him to doubt old people and to change his mood from confident to desperate. As he was cycling through the desert, desperately chinging to life in hopes he could find, are water, he realized that old people know of the past better than the future as they don’t get out to the every changing world as much as they used to whereas, at the beginning he was confident in the directions and wisdom of the old men. The setting he was in made him a little more wise.
1	Because the setting of the cyclist ride is dry desert it makes the cyclist seem more and more determined. He's is going against the odds so it seems like hes pushing himself to the limit. Against the heat and the long road he's on and having no water all seems lost for the cyclist. But in the end he pulls himself together and makes it happen for himself and triumphs over adversity.
8	Dear, local newspaper I agree with @CAPS1 that computers are not good because of different reasons such as putting a person's health in danger for not excersicing much or making people spend more time on a computer than interact with family &amp; friends and sadly also it causes people to change there attitudes and ways of being. But if you wanna hear more than you will just have to read on. There are plenty consequences that people have for spending too much time on the computer, such as people getting addicted to watching certain things or addicted to watching certain things or simply get addicted to the computer itself. Plenty of people now a days, have to wear glasses and probably most of them have to wear them because of too much computer, and it must be really bad having to wear glasses the rest of your life. Also too much computer is bad for a person's health because they're giving more time to a computer than spending that time excercising. I believe people should spend more time interacting with family &amp; friends because it can also make you lose your friends and/or family because your not giving them the time they need &amp; friends and family are one of the most important things in a person's life. And last but not least. too much computer can change a person such as changing their manners, the way they speak, and there attitides. Well I've giving you reasons why I think computers are not good such as, putting health in danger, changing a person's life, and causin them to lose family &amp; friends now is up to you the rest.
2	From reading the story, l believe the setting of the desert he was cycling affected him immensly. I believe it affected him in the way his attitude of the cyclist changed for the worst. At first he was very motivated, determined, and hydrated. As time and miles went on the scenery mover changed.That can be really hard. in heated water or, you need to be as hydrated ad possible, especially it an enduring in physical activity. When time he went on, he was getting low on water and had nothing in think about a long other them, how much larger, how thirsty he was  and is this worth it? It is a lot eager to the motivated when there is thing to look at to keep your mind of the attitude of the cyclist changed for the worst. In my point of view strongly believe that it could have been form working at the some sandy desert for seeds a long period of time. I have ??? ??? ??? in exercising while making on  ???. It’s hard to see  ??????????? thing. My attitude will go farm.” I’m so determined to I’m bored “ to” what’s the point.” But I thought it was great how he never gave up ??? things got bad. It opened my eyes to see how great it is to reacts your own goals.        
1	The features of the setting affect the cyclist by dehydrating him. The cyclist said, “I toiled on. At some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake.&quot; The cyclist was in the desert and each mile he rode he became more and more dehydrated.  The desert sun drying out his body. He said with each passing landmark, “I eased past trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state.”  @CAPS1 that the more he went on the more the desert affected him and dehydrated him.
1	The features of the setting affected the cyclist in many ways. One way is that the cyclist not sticking to his map. Instead of sticking to his map he had asked a couple of old people. The old people that gave the cyclist directions also gave him a short cut to take. That’s where the second effect came in where the cyclist started to use a shortcut instead of the main road. That’s how the features of the setting affected the cyclist.   
2	Some features of the setting that affected the cyclist were the road conditions and road changes with the hills. So far the cyclist had a great ride for about two miles into his journey after that it started to change. This is supported when the author states, “Not two miles into this next section of the ride, I noticed the terrain changing“ (kurmaskie). Even though the author started this journey out nice it did not take long for thing to change against him. Although the hills and road conditions changing the character in the story still gets through his problems with out much worries. With all of the problems in the setting the cyclist still comes through to end his journey.
3	The features of the setting cause the cyclist two main problems: doubt and dehydration. From the essay, you can infer that the cyclist doubts he will ever make it to Yosemite because of the constant features in the essay that cause him to lose his hope and confidence. For example, near the end of the essay the cyclist is already exhausted and hopeless but then sees a building over a hill. He hurries to the building only to find out that it is an abandoned, run–down @ORGANIZATION1 factory. After getting his hopes up, he is forced to get back on his bike and carry on. This features of the setting causes further disappointment to the cyclist and installs more doubt into his mind. Despite losing his confidence and hopes to make it to Yosemite, the features of the setting also cause him a serious, literal problem: dehydration. The weather is not and he has to carry on over hills and on rough roads. He is running low on water and at the one town he finds the water from the pump is undrinkable. The features of the setting are causing him these problems and are the reason hid health is at risk.  
1	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. @NUM1 way is the condition of roads. Another is the heat. Another is snakes. Another is no town insight. The final one is lack of info. @MONTH1 be the guy made it. @MONTH1 be he got hurt on the ride.  Maybe a snake bit him. Either way, the setting affected the cyclist in many ways.   
1	In the essay, the description of the setting was dry, hot, very open, and desserted. The description could suggest lonlieness, obviously. Even though the man was all alone and didn’t know where he was going, he still persisted. While he thought about “the cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite.” This thought kept him strong, so he kept trying.
1	There were many land features that affected the cyclist and his trip. First of all, it is a desert, which greatly affects him as there is no water in deserts. There was also a snake, which could have bit and kiiled him. As the road were not very well paved and had obviously been abandoned for years it made cycling much harder for him. And the juice factory just taunted him, making him remember his need for water, as did the well that did not pump cold water, but instead pumped hot,gross water
2	When the cyclist first starts his journey he is very sure of himself. He sees everything as the old men told him. As he travels on he notices everything is abandoned and empty. “There was no one in sight not a building, car, or structure of any kind.” The man started becoming very unsure. You could tell he says “I wiped the sweat from my eyes to make sure it wasn’t a mirage, and tried not to get excited.” He was very doubtful he’d get to where he was going. In the end he was very relieved he found a fishing spot with a bathroom and fresh water.  
3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist in this story alot. Having unreliable directions, barely enough water for the journey, poor road conditions and other hazards like the heat and animals made this a very difficult journey for the cyclist. Starting the journey the cyclist recieved bad information on how to get to his destonation which lead him on a long hard journey with not much water. He says in the story “The speed limit was @NUM1. I was doing a water-depleting @NUM2”. This means he was running out of water too fast for the amount of land he was covering. Another feature of the netting that affected him was that the road conditions got worse and worse untill he reached a high way late in his journey. He said “flat road was replaced by short rolling hills.&quot; This means the faster, easy, to ride terrain was replaced by slower harder to ride on terrain. These features of the setting could have been very dangerous and maybe factal and affected the cyclist alot living this story. 
9	You need to gather information for a project you're presenting in school, but how are you going to find aout about your topic quickly and easily? Most people will turn to one of the most commonly used piece of technology in the @LOCATION1, the computer. The computer is used for quick and easy research, interacting and communicating with friends and for personal entertainment. Some peol argue that the computer will take away from enjoying nature, spending time with family and friends and exercising. But what if we didn't have the computer? The possability of research, etc. Would be much more difficult. For example: computers help us learn about almost anything quickly and easily. this could help make work for school or jobs less stressful. Also, a computer can be accessed right in your name, so no travel is required. The computer has programs that are used to prepare articles, essays, slide shows and brochures for presentation, as well. If we didn't have a computer, research would be much more of a struggle and could require travel. Computers are one of the most common ways to communicate with friends and family. Websits and e-mail helps you keep intouch with anyone around the world. You can write e-mails, access live chat or even webcam. E-mailing is just like mailing a letter except it is dilivered instantly and doesn't cost anything. There is also no risk of anyone reading your mail. Live chat iswhen you chat over text on the computer. Webcam is face to face interacting which givs off the effect of talking in person: @CAPS1 benefit is that communicates over the computer doesnt cost a thing. Lastly, computers provide games for your personal entertainment, which helps kill boredom. The computer also helps improve hand-eye coordination, along with staying orginized @CAPS2, pictures, videos and more can be placed in files and saved on the computer making it easy for you to open them at @CAPS1 time. Computers @MONTH1 take away from some activities but think of how much harder and more stressful things will be without it. I think that the computer has a good effect on people as well as it being a helpful piece of technology.
2	The feature of the setting affected the cyclist, because as his surrondings changed he lost hope of making it to Yosemite National park. Such as when he was riding through his first town and it looked abandoned he wasn’t so sure if he shold keep going. As well as when he didn’t see anyone or any buildings he got worried and was wanting to lose hope. But  as second road sign appeared he was relieved.
2	The setting in this short story cause the cyclist to doubt his survival. The main problem is water, or lack there of. The cyclist has no water and thinks it’s only a matter of time before he dies. Another big problem is the rough terrain. The rough terrain is hard for the cyclist to overcome. Also, there is no buildings, people, or cars in sight to save him. Until he finds the bait shop, if anything would have happened to him, there would’ve been no one there to help.
3	The features of the setting of “Do not exceed posted speed limit” greatly impact the cyclist, in a negative way. For example, when the road changes from smooth and easy to rolling and full of hills. It makes it difficult for him to bike. He needs to use more energy to get over the hills. Another example is when it says “tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me.” The connection with seeing a tumbleweed is that of being deserted and alone so this increased his feelings of despair. Lastly, he sees the Welch’s Grape Juice Factory, which is deserted and serves to only make him thirstier. All of these things affect the cyclist. The fact that he sees the grape juice factory is also ironic, because he is extremely dehydrated and the factory is abandoned.
3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in a few ways. first of these is the blazing heat. He is basically in a desert and he is running low on water. As he starts to run out of water he starts conserving it which is dehydrating him so he is becoming weaker, “I would conserve my water and go inward for an hour or so- a test of my inner spirit. Next up is the rough terrain. When you hit rough terrain on a bike it can get hard to keep going and the cyclist was already short on water “a large highway sign jumped out at me. I read: rough road ahad: Do not exceed posted speed limit sometimes life can be so cruel“. Finally is the structure First there was the Ghost town with the “battery acid” tasting water. Also there was the Welch’s grape Juice factory and bottling plant which were both probably dimeriling. “A sandblusted picture of a young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice into his mouth could still be seen. I hung my head”. As you can see the features of the settings generily affected the cyclist.
1	The author finds the desolate and harsh settings to be not discouraging, rather they stand out as a cause of amusement and fun, quest-like tests. The author writes that after arriving at his first ghost-town, he chuckles, amused by the funny “old codgers” and their crazy ideas. When he arrives at the second establishment, and realizes it isn’t the least bit established anymore, he’s slightly disappointed, but sees it as “a test of [his] inner spirit.” At the third building an abandoned factory he still appreciates the irony of the situation. While biking across the desert, he refuses to be discouraged by the empty horizon and instead uses it as a point of reference to work his progress and as a way to push himself. Though the author is faced with empty disappointing views, he keeps his spirits up and keeps pushing 
3	In the story Rough Road Ahead: do not excess speed limit, the reader sees the scenery and terrain get rougher, and lonelier, and as the cyclist travels and limits are being pushed his outlook is somewahat grim he only expects the worst. The rough road strats out after a water pump he finds gives him piping not, brackish water that tasted like battery acid. Water in a sense in this story is a metaphor to his life, and is the source for him living. In the beginning he drank it regularly and when he gets to the pump it is bad, just like when things start to turn sour in the story itself. The cyclist in this story is very a ware to how his body is and acknowledges his dehydration. At one point he says “and the growing realization that I could drop from a heat stroke simply because I had listened to some gentlemen who hadn’t been off their porches in a decade&quot; he later said it caused him to laugh sadly, hopelessly the lack of humans and their technology really broke him down.
3	The desert is the crulest of nature’s environments. Its lack of water, dry air, and punishing heat are enough to kill even the hardiest creature. When traveling through a desert, one must maintain a constant water supply and know their path with respect to the power of nature in “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit”, cycler Joe Kurmaskie must overcome the desert’s heat and lack of water to survive. As the author observes in paragraph @NUM1, “wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, I could drop from heatstroke.” If the human body overheats, it becomes sick and unable to properly function. When in the desert one must keep cool or perish. In @NUM2, Kurmaskie begins to realize the danger of running out of water in the desert, “ I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly, and I was travelling through the high deserts of California in June. “As this water starts to run out, Joe suffers from dehydration, despair, and a loss of balance. Water is essential in a desert environment, without it, as Joe observes, “the birds would pick (you) clean, leaving only some expensive out door gear”.
3	The features in the setting of the essay “Rough Road Ahead Do not exeed the Posted Speed limit” affect the cyclist in a cruel manner. The old man say that the towns are going to be there and they are just not functioning towns. To make the cyclist feel hopeless the setting puts him in a California day in June which is extremely hot and puts in all these unexpected twists. A cruel thing to add in the essay was when it read “The Speed limit was 55 mph. I was doing a water depleting 12 mph” This lowers the cyclists confidence making him seem more worried. Another cruel thing is the author adding a welch’s Grape Juice factory that had been abandoned with “A sandblasted picture of a young boy pouring @NUM1 refreshing glass of juice into his mouth&quot; totally causing him to lose hope left. These features in setting are cruel.
3	The features in the setting, such as the ghost town desert, and the Juice factory, give the cyclist a sense of hopelessness. He is running out of water when he comes to the ghost town, which he thought was @CAPS1 because the next town was only a short ways down the road. However when he came to the next “town” and attempted to use the water pump, a rather hot, foul liquid came up instead of water. He was beginning to lose hope when he came to the Welch’s factory, abandoned. All hope from him at that point was lost, claiming “the birds will pick me clean,” To the cyclist also was best, then he was “saved” by a bait shop. These features in the setting gradually emptied his hope little by little, until he came to the Bait shop after which his hope, but certainly not his fait in old men, was returned.
1	In the setting of the essay; &quot;Rough Road Ahead: Do not Exceed Posted Speed Limit.&quot; had a great affect on the cyclist. It made him even more determined to finish because the terrain was so hard to ride through. For example, &quot;At some point, tumber weeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake-it really did look like a diamond back-back the majority of the pavement in front of me, I eased past, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state. &quot;The author fully explains how no matter how bad the obstacles are he comes across he keeps trying to easy on by. The terrain affect the character by keeping him determined. This happens to many people in their sports. For example in football they take any problems and use them as reasons to push themselves harder to finish the game. 
9	Dear local newspaper, I strongly believe that computers have a great and beneficial affect on society. They have @CAPS4 many features. options, and abilities to use! Would you really try to prevent your child, friends, and families from using such an amazing invention that helps us every day? The computer can help others communicate, help educate you, and even prepare you for the future. One great option that computers have is the option to communicate with others. You can set up an email or a chatting account to talk with friends and family. Now some people might think, &quot;@CAPS1 not use a phone to talk to others.&quot; @CAPS2 these are many reasons @CAPS1 talking online can be better than using a phone. I remember one time a few years ago. Me and my cousin @PERSON2 were alone at her house when the phone wasn't working @PERSON2 went down stars to get us some sodas when I heard a crashing sound, @PERSON2 had fallen down the stairs. Because the phones wren't opperating, i hopped to the computers in her room to quickly &quot;chat&quot; with my dad and tell him what happened. From these on, my dad called on ambulance and @PERSON2 was allright. @CAPS4, not only are computers a great way to communicate, but they can also save somenes life! Another feature computers have is that they can actually educate. For example, if a stuident has to write a paper for school about the @CAPS3, then they would need to do some research. The internet explorer on your computer can open your eyes to a world of kodedge. All you have to do is go to a search engin such as @ORGANIZATION1 or @ORGANIZATION2 and type in the subject you wish to learn more about. Before you know it, there's millions upon millions of websites that can educate you on the subject you want to gain more knoledge on. @PERSON1, a high school teacher, states that &quot;@PERCENT1 of students in the school use the computer to help them with homework and reseacrh.&quot; @CAPS4, there you have it, the computer's a great resource for information. One last reason computers are @CAPS4 beneficial for our society is because they can actually help you prepare for future jobs. Perhaps some day your child will get a job working in on office where they must use computers all day long. The heard of the company is not going to hire you if you are not expierenced with computers. However, if you know how to use a computer @CAPS2, then you have a great chance of getting a job that can support you and your family. Studies say now that &quot;@PERCENT2 of buisnesses involve using a computer&quot; Computers are becoming a bigger part of society by the second, it's important start learning more about them as soon as possible! I think now it's very clear how important computers are in our society. They help increase communication, a great source for knoledge, and bhelp prepare you for jobs. With each passing day, computers help advance the future and help make the world a better place.
1	This essay takes place on a barren desert landscape.The setting being very hot causes him to get dehydrated faster. Also fones are scarce. In this place as he says sometime into free essay, “the negg down was only @NUM1 down the road. This place also caused him to question what he saw thinking it might be just a mirage.
2	The many features of the setting affected the cyclist in many different ways. The beauty of nature around him affected him by making him laugh. In the essay, it says, “ on a gorgeous day in June caused him to laugh.” This shows, despite what happened, he was might are on a nice day outside giving him an optimistic attitude. Also, the beating sun affected him in a different way. It caused him to sweat and almost die of dehydration. “ growing realization that l could drop from heatstroke ” This shows that he was tensely aware that he could die from the suns might. So, the settings around the cyclist affected him in different ways.
1	In the setting the conditions were brutal. The author experienced sedring heat, dyhdration and getting wrong directions. He experienced depression and mear death. He had an encounter with a big old snake and last he reached his distination. This affected him and he learned to bring a map and not to take direction from old people.
2	The setting affected the cycist because it made his ride harder. For example, the weather was extremly hot. “The sun was beginning to beat down.” He says it didn’t affect him, yet he was very thirsty and dehydrated so internally it affected him. Also, the weeds and snakes frightened him. “tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake.” This could not of made his ride easier. Next the hills and roads, “over one long, crippling hill.” This proves how intense his ride was. Thats how the setting affected the cyclist in “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” by Joe Kurmaskie.
3	The features of the nearby setting affect the cyclist in a bad way. The four main things that affect him are the heat, lack of water, lack of nearby buildings, and @CAPS2. For this cyclist one of the biggest problems is the heat. He says” i was travelling through the high deserts of California in June”. this shows that it is quite hot outside by the month stated. June is quite a hot month especially in @CAPS1 deserts. The second problem is the cyclist lack of water. He says throughout the story how thirsty he is and how much he needs to drink some water. When he reaches the end, however he finds water. The third problem is when he needs water, he can’t find anywhere due to the lack of buildings. He pedals great distances trying to find “towns” nearby. Once he finds them, they are either “ghost towns” or are not useful at all. The final problem he faces is the @CAPS2. He says “At some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake… blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me.” @CAPS2 is getting in his way and not helping him to reach his destination at all. Truly . the features of the nearby setting are affecting him in a tramatizing way, because so many things like heat, lack of water , buildings, and @CAPS2 are inches way.
1	The settings effects the cyclist because in California it could be really hot sometimes. The cyclist could dehydrate on a long trip and pass out really get hurt. Also there are a lot of hills which could be really hard on the cyclist.
2	In the essay, the author added many features that could be picked all about the cyclist jouney. One feature was that his water supply was running short. This shows exactly how hot it was and how much he was drinking. Another feature would be the rusty old pipe with the bad water: This shows that that town had been abanodoned for years and the water supply wasn’t up for drinking. The essay in all shows how hand it is in hot weather with lack of supplies and no sense of direction.
1	The cyclist in “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit.” had to go through a hard time in the California desert.  It was hard for him because it was very hot in the desert in June. That he was almost out of water; at first his ride was easy on flat ground. But when he came to rolling he had to use more energy and ???.
2	The features of the setting affected the cyclist because he was really thirsty and then the dry air with no town nearby made it even worse. There was also the bumpy roads and hills that were tiring and mad the cyclist even thirstier. Finnally there was the factory that made him think about juice and made him thirstier yet.
1	The features of the setting affect the cyclist by old people changing the definition of adon’t talk to strangers. The main character
8	Dear local Newspaper, I am writing this to let you know that many people are spending to much time on computors rather than enjoying nature. People say advances in technology believe that computers have an effect on people in such a way of saying. Many people showed on as is say can use the computers but to remember to think about nature what nice things it has in store for us. Im going to saying that experts are right that people are spending too much time on their computers and less time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends. Im thinking that in some points many family members and friends see then other relative person on companion so much on the computers it's like if they are thinking maybe they don't care anymore. Caring about nature and your loved ones is such a great thing. @PERCENT1 of my friends agree with me when I say that people should be less on electronic devices because that can effect your brain or maybe your eye sight (eye vision.) @CAPS1 more and more people should lay off it. @PERSON1 of yale university has conducted extensive reaserch and proven that many computers that are being used by people can be damage of using it every time. I strongly agree with him that there should be a time limit on something to let them later on have the spaare time to enjoy and have fun with nature but something different such as to enjoy listening to soft music. I know you will agree with me when I say that maybe people should spend less time effecting themselves. Whatsoever im hoping from you to agree with my position so this can be possible to break this habit of going on computers and having no time for your family and friends is not such a to start off with.
2	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because real cyclist know what the speed is for a bike so you don’t need to tell them. If a cyclist needed some dierections they would go to a gas station not to some old person’s house. A real cyclist can go as long as they want before the stop because they are tired. A real cyclist knows haw to do tricks on a bike don’t have to do them over and over again to be able to do them. A real cyclist doesn’t have to train to go into a tourtement and win they must have to practice to be able to win.
3	The setting in the story had a big effect on the cyclist. The hot deserted surroundings made the cyclist become tired or discoveraged. For example the cyclist observes, &quot;one ramshacure shed, several rusty pumps, and a comes that couldn't hold in the lamest mule greeted me. This sight was trouble.&quot; This quote shows the old, beat down environment worried him. Also the author says, &quot;there was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind.&quot; In this quote, the cyclist realizes his isolation, and begins to become more determined to reach his destination. Realize, ever been lost, then youknow that it can be discouraging if there's no sign of life around you. All you want to do is keep going and hope you can find your way. This feeling is shown through the cyclistand now the setting around him affects his journey.
2	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. One of them is that it was in the daylight and the sun bothers the cyclist. Another one is that because there was nothing around him, he felt frustrated. “There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind.” If something were there, he wouldn’t feel frustrated and at least he would have more hope to find something. 
3	In the narrative &quot;Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit&quot; by Joe Kurmaskie, the cyclist was affected in a deadly negative way by the setting. The cyclist is travelling through “The high deserts of California in June.” It was hot, so hot the infact, that the author realized he could “drop from heatstroke” at anytime. This unbearable heat, coupled with the “crippling” hilly terrain was enough to reduce the cyclist to a stale of severe dehydration. Obviously not exactig a positive effect. The swelting heat and merciless hills of the setting would not be quite so awful if there had been locations to stop, rest and replenish the eyeishes diverting water supply. However, “There was no one in sight, not a building, or a structure of any kind” The cyclist was incomplete isolation for over @NUM1 miles of arid desert, the sweating sun heating down upon him as he toiled up steep unyielding hills clearly the setting was affecting the cyclist in horribly negative way.
2	When riding a bike for a very long time with no water is bad but is even worst when your surroundings are worst. For example, when the cyclist has no water it is a day with nothing around him to help. Also with no water he could pass out &amp; get dehydrated. When he finds no one to help &amp; nothing around him he sucks on a pebble to keep his mouth hydrated. Therefor you should always check you destination on a bike before just going for it.
1	It is very difficult to be outside in heat, let alone advise from old folks and riding a bike. If it feels like it is @NUM1 out sides, you don’t need to be out there. Doesn,t matter how long you are outside for, a heatstroke could come at any body fast than they can count to @NUM2.
1	On the way to @CAPS1 the cyclist was riding through dry, hot weather in rough terrain. This was making him tired and dehydrated. Half way throgh his journey he couldn't see anything for miles. That must of been discouraging. All the way there he was dehydrated and when he found water it was @NUM1 degrees @CAPS2 because of the heat.
2	Hot, bumpy roads, no shade-all are things that affect the cyclist on his journey. He was riding in??? the and then the sun started beating down on him and he said it felt like the desert,” considering it was so hot. The road was fine at first and than he get a while down the had and it really started getting rough and hard to ride on. The part where he has no shade has to suck because he has the sun beating down on him all the time. All are reasons why the cyclist shouldn’t have taken directions in the first place.
2	The setting of “Rough Road Ahead: Do not exceed the Speed Limit” effects the cyclist in many was. The words “high deserts of California in June,” from the story show that it is very hot and dry. The cyclist get's very tired and in the desert there aren't big ponds to get water out of, so if you don’t have water you don’t have anything. Also the cyclist suffers the pain a difficulty of having to drive on, over and down rough terrain. In the story it is said there was a sign that said “Rough Road Ahead.” There were also obsticals such as tumbleweeds and snakes he had to get around. The dry, rough, dangerous setting put the cyclist life in danger, but because of dedication he got through it.
2	The features of the setting in “Do Not @CAPS1 Posted Speed Limit” affected the cyclist. The text states, &quot;Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills,&quot; (Kurmaskie @NUM1). The flat road that was easy to bike on had changed to many hills that made the cyclist's job alot harder. The biker was negatively affected by this setting because it contributed to his rough times and caused him to lose hope.
9	Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 experts are concerned about today's population's computer usage. With this I agre, as many children and adults are counted and labeled as obese, or overweigt. Technology has advanced as enough to having machines do everyday tasks, proving how lazy some @CAPS3 are now-a-days. People sit at home standing at a computer screen, forgetting about spending time exercising, enjoying nature, or being out and having fun with friends and family. Having a computer clearly interferes with one's @CAPS4 @CAPS5 in real @CAPS5, not the &quot;@CAPS4 @CAPS5&quot; of chatting with others over internet. Having applications released that connect people over the computer devastates the reason to leave your house. Now with video, you virtually meet the other person, showing how lonely and individually separate you can of from others. While your friends are having a party. You'll be absent, as I'm sure they won't have a webcame there. Another reason why a computer is not needed is many people neglect pure nature. When surrounded by new digital age. The beauty of the outdoors become forgotten. Sure you can watch videos, and look at pictures of nature, but is that really anything compared to the crisp, clean aid against your hair or the once in a lifetime animal actions you @MONTH1 see? Plus, nature and the fact of being outside @MONTH1 inspire you to continue a diet, or begin one, seeing how healthy and perfect the outdoor can be. It also serves as a great place to exercise. As we all know, obesity is a factor in the @LOCATION1 and around the world. But now, being oevrweight is at an all time high, claiming lives and causing many into depression. in my opinion, I believe this is highly realted to computer usage. Especially with fast food playing a role. People have not realized the need to exercise more often. In conclusion, you can see how computer usage has affected us as a nation, and in a negative way. Computer using @MONTH1 be &quot;ok&quot; when used in moderation, like sweets or oily foods. it does serve as a way to pass time, for a while, but so does exercise... Which one would you think would end as a believe solution? Obviously, we must stop relying on technology to help, and begin activities ourselves again.
2	In the story “Rough Road Ahead” the cyclist is affected by the features of the setting in many ways. One way the cyclist is affected by the features of the setting in many ways. One way the cyclist is affected is when they have to cross the hills and plains. The hills make it very hard to pedal when going up hill. Another way the cyclist is challenged is when he is almost out of water. They need water to survive especially during their long bike ride. Lastly, the heat the cyclist must endure also affects them. The heat makes it hard to stay focused on making the long journey.
3	The features effect the setting of the story in a big way. At the beginning of his ride there are people around and he has no troubles. After he talks to the old men and starts on his ride to the @NUM1 town there is no one around. There are no buildings in site at all and no source of water. Since there was no one around his confidence of actualy completing the trip begar to go down. Once he arrived at the first town he noticed that it was an old town and no one was there anymore. This made him mad and his confidence dropped a lot. Once he reached the next building he noticed that there was no one there either and then thought hed never make it and that he die. Once he reached the final place it was a more occupied setting. There were people around. He then began to feel relieved that he could get water. The setting with no one around make him lose a lot of confidence.
2	The features of a setting, such as terrain and weather greatly affect the cyclist who is biking in it. The features of a setting can make the cyclists trip either easier or harder. Weather can make them use up their water faster or slower, rain as bad road conditions could force a cyclist go slower. In the essay “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” the cyclist is slowed down and more fatigued because of the features of the setting he was in. The lack of water and settlements slowed him down. Rough roads did as well. Hills and animals on the road slowed down the cyclist even more.  The features of a setting can help or hinder a cyclist, and in the case of the one in “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” the features seriously impared his bike ride.
1	The feature of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. It it was a straight road, it would be smooth sailing. If the road was bumpy, he’d jump up and down a little. If he was riding in the woods, it would be cool and a little dark. If he was riding in the desert, it would be very hot and bright.
3	The features of the setting in “Rough Road Ahead: Do not exceed posted speed limit” greatly affect the cyclist. I’m sure that the heat makes the cyclist more thirsty, and heat can also drain energy extremely fast. Being in “the california desert in the middle of June” does not sound like an enjoyable time to be riding a bike. When the cyclist got tired and exhausted from not having any water, I’m sure that riding past all of the empty land had an effect on his attitude. I think that seeing a building made him get excited, and then when he found out that it was nothing more than an abandoned building, his spirits greatly dropped. He probably felt that he couldn’t continue for very much longer simply because all of the buildings he came across were empty, or abandoned. When the cyclist reached the bait store, he probably felt much better, and very relieved to have gotten there before he had a heat stroke.
3	When the cyclist passed through the old towns the old man told him to, the setting played a big part in making his situation harder to overcome when he passed through the first abandoned town, the water source was dry and empty. The text says &quot;pumped the handle for several minutes but the water would not cool it tasted like battery acid.” The second drink source he passed was on abandoned @PERSON1’s Juice factory. The text says,‘a sand blasted picture of a young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice into his mouth.” These two objects made his situation mentally harder to get through because he was so close to what he needed numerous times, then it was taken away.
2	The cyclist is affected by the change in terrain from flat to hilly, the elderly men’s directions and most importantly his thirst. He tries to save what little water he has left for time when he really needs it. He looks for a place to cool off and get water, which he finally does in the end. He’s also a little bit angry and disappointed of the old men’s directions. He’s really going a lot more miles then he should be according to the directionsand he's beginning to wonder if they’ve lost it. 
3	There are many different features such as the weather, road condition, and how the person is feeling. The weather can effect if it is rain or weather the road are messed up he could get a flat. The way that the person is feeling is a big part on weather they try hard or they do not worry about it too much.
3	According to the essay features of the setting affect the cyclist. If the cyclist is in the middle of a hot desert in June with no water, the cyclist will become excessively thirsty the longer they go. For example; the author states “I had been hitting my bottles pritty regularly, and I was traveling through the high desert of California in June”. The terrain changes to short, rolling hills from flat land causing the cyclist to push herself to get the next town to get water. For instance; she states “over one long, crippling hill, a building came into view”. This cause the cyclist to use what they thought of as their last burst of energy to get down there, but the building was abandoned, thus making the cyclist feel let down. As the cyclist continued on a setting of a bait store came and the cyclist felt relief because now she could get water. These examples show the change of setting on the cyclist’s trip and how it affected her.
2	In the essay “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” a cyclist was trying to get to Yosemite National Park. He followed the ‘short cut’ that some old men gave him, instead of taking the longer route. These old men had no clue what they were realy talking about, so the cyclist ended up taking a path through more obstacles. When the cyclist was in need of more water he ran into &quot;several rusty pumps.&quot; No water would come out of these pumps so he had no choice but to keep going @CAPS1 water. As he moved forwad in his travels he said that the “Flat roads were replaced by short, rolling hills.” @CAPS1 any water, he did not have much strength left to face rolling hills, but he had no choice. The cyclist had to go on for miles @CAPS1 seeing anyone or anything. “There was noone in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind.&quot; His troubles finally came to an end after getting directions from another man at a fish camp.
8	Dear @CAPS1, I belive that people are spending to much time one computors. I belive this and I have @CAPS7 reasons why. @CAPS2 first reason is that people waste money on it. Also every thing they get from the computer you get from book. And finaly @CAPS2 reason is because of the &quot;@CAPS8 crises.&quot; @CAPS2 first reason for say that people spend to much time on the computer is that people waste two much money on it. I belive this because of your electric bill and and @CAPS3 bill. The people who have computer electric bill is always very high and for reason they are forced to pay @NUM1 or more dollars on electricity. This is also true becuse of the constant charging of laptops or running of computors. Also they have to pay @NUM2 and odd dollars on the @CAPS3 bill to keep the @CAPS3 connection. So that bocome a total of @NUM3 and odd dollars going down the dawn. @CAPS2 second reason for this is that anything and every thing you can get on the @CAPS3 you can get from books. I belive this because where do you think the website makers get there info from. Reading books also increase your knoledge so that at any time you can quickly come up with an answer. Another reason is that some website are not always accurate with their information. @CAPS2 third and final reason for this is that we are all dealing with this &quot;@CAPS8 crisis.&quot; @CAPS7 people every day are getting less and less active because of computers. This I cause less people to be phisicaly active and less fit. And the @LOCATION1 is suffering because of it. Less and less people are joining the army because of this crises and computor are sadly con triputing to the world wide crisis. I eagerly hope that @CAPS2 letter hase helped you see @CAPS2 point of view on this subject. To show that people spend to much time on there computer because its a waste of money, anything you can get from a computor you can get from book, and because of the &quot;@CAPS8 crisis&quot;.
2	The setting adds a sense of ergancy. The cyclist is running out of water and he is the middle of the dessert. If he had been in the forest or the subburbs it would not be so grave. He talks about passing out and dieing. He exclaims it did n’t really matter. I was going to die and the birds were going to pick me clean.”
1	In the story, do not exceed posted speed limit by Joe Kurmaskie the cyclist was affected about the road ahead. He took advice that he thought was right but it was wrong. So it took him off track of his good he was trying to reach
2	The way the settings affect the cyclist is very crucel. First, the cyclist took directions from someone who has not left thier porch in decades. So once he accepted the directions and used them problems occurred. One main problem is the cyclist has a lack of water supply. Also the cyclist has incounters with snakes. Another the directions where way off so he had longer to go then he thought. Also when he arrived from his journey he found a deserted town. So in conclusion the cyclest uses his own directions from now on.
3	As the setting changes in the story, so does the cyclist’s narrator’s mood. His mood changes from happy and confident to indifferent and scared. At first the cyclist is so happy about Yosemite that he is just care free and no worries at all. He says that, “I rode into the morning with strong legs and a smile on my face.” Even at his first “ghost town” he just “chuckled, checked my water supply, and moved on”. After this point he could not be so care free. After this town he came to, “One ramshackle shed, several thirsty pumps, and men”. He said, “this was troubling”, it was very hot and he had been drinking his water pretty often. He said that, “He failed on.&quot; He started to get sort of scared he realized that he could, &quot;drop from a heatstroke.&quot; He was scared that because of his idea to believe the old men he might possibly die. He finally get happy when he reaches the bait shop and he got his drink. From then on the stock to his map. His attitude changed greatly throughout the story.
2	In “Rough Road Ahead: Do not exceed posted speed limit,&quot; the cyclist is affected alot by his surroundings. He is leaving the old water pump for Yosemite. “Not two miles flat road was replaced by short rolling hills. The speed limit was 55. I was doing a water-depleting @NUM1.” This shows that as the terrain gets rougher and harder, how much harder it is for the cyclist to go on. Also, since he is already getting to the point at which he is getting dehydrated, it is that much harder for the already tired cyclist to go on any further more less make it all the way to Yosemite. That is how the terrain affects the cyclist.  
1	The setting affected the cyclist by making him very hot. He said he started sucking on stones because he heard that if you suck on stones it makes you not thirsty. He also said he might hit a bump and swallow one of the rocks. He said he wanted to swallow the rocks. The reason for that was that he was so hot. He didn’t even no where he was goin.
2	The features of the setting did not help the cyclist on his trip. First of all he was in the desert on a bike! Which helped him dehydrate faster. Secondly, the ‘towns’ around the way  had been abandoned, leaving no place to get more water and no place to ask for directions. Lastly there were no other people around so if the cyclist was to get into trouble, he wouldn't be able to find help. 
1	The features of the settings effects the cyclist by many reasons such as; dehydration, the road my cause bike to stop working. Since there is a lack of water in the dessert it seems, the guy could get dehydrated easily. The intense heat can cause that to. The road that he is riding on my cause the tires to pop.
2	The cyclist was eager to get to Yosemite park he listened to the “old timers who haven’t left the confines of thier porches since Carter was in office”. He went the way the old men told him to take. He went down a hill in to town which was empty into a hard road &amp; snakes in his way then up a hill then went down the hill saw a abanded “Welch’s Grape Juice Factory”. Then he saw a sign say “Gary And Wilber’s FISH CAMP-IF YOU WANT BAIT FOR THE BIG ONES, WE’RE YOUR BEST BET!”. So then he runs into the bathroom &amp; drinks from the sink. Before he got there he was getting thirsty &amp; tired &amp; when he saw the abanded building he saw a young boy drinking a juice he wiped his eyes to see if he wasn’t seen a mirage. So then he sticks a few pebbles into his mouth. It read that sucking on stones help take your mind off thirst by allowing what spit you have left to circulate. Then he left then a stone went his throat. His troubles, thirst, &amp; fear were all behind him when he saw that sign.
1	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. One feature of the setting was the heat. It affected him by getting him dehydrated. For example the text states,“The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips I could drop from a heatstroke ” This meant the heat was getting to him.
10	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I have heard the concern of many scientists about computers. Computers have brought us into the @DATE1 and have improved our society but they are harming our childrens health and education. Because of computers, children and adults around the world are spending less time with family and friends, they are not enjoying athletic activities and they are having health problems. Because of an increase in technology, children and adults are not spending time with their families. The computers are ruining family connections. For example, a study at @ORGANIZATION1 showed that families with more computers in their houses communicated less. The children are talking to their friends online or are going on social networking sites instead of talking in person to their family members. Also, computers are making it very hard for families to have meals together. When the children are on the computer, they do not want to leave. This obsetion with the technology is making it harder for families to grow moved and of were more succesful in school. The computers are children from a better education. Athletic activities are also suffering been so of @PERSON1, fresh air more children They will be on websites all day insted of being on a. Sports teams because of computers. The electricity that runs computers of this radiation. Being exposed to this could lead to brain damage or possible death. When my aunt bought a computer for the first time, she complained about massive headaches that kept returning. This was caused by the radiation emitted from the computer. Another health risk is obesity. When children sit in front of a computer for many hours, they have an increase in apetite. These children eat because they have nothing better to do. While on the computer, the users eat and will gain weight because of the loss of exercise. They could become obese and possibly get diabetes. Therefore, there is less communication in families, a loss of excersise, and health concerns caused by the computers. The consequences of misusing this technology are devastating and could be life thretening. Thus, I urge you to do whatever is possible to use the computer less or face the consequences that come with it.
3	The author made the setting seem long and unbearable, felt of undesirable heat and lack of water at hand. Specially in the way he kept describing the road with all these challenges that kept appearing like after @NUM1 miles to a town then @NUM2 miles passed that he, “came to a park of ???. One ramshackly shed, several rusty pumps and  a carrol that couldn’t hold in the hamest mule greeted me.This sight was troubling.” Then he went in a discharge, &quot;I was traveling strenght the high deserts of California in June. @CAPS1 ?? imagine, the heat, and unbareabalnes of the ??? journey still I face. @CAPS1 that bike seen endless.Then with a thrust gaining on him for example, &quot;I was doing a water-deplety 12 mph, sanctures life can seen be cruel. &quot;@CAPS1 him feel his constrain regrate on the journey @CAPS1 me feel his constrain sorrow for his endless journey he had to go through. Another example is, &quot;I riped the sweat from my eyes to make sure I wasn't a mirage&quot;. Then, reaching this, the building abondoned years ago. @CAPS1 his journey seen hopeless and long had that make endless with first wave problems getting strength at him @CAPS1 his journey seen to be harder and filled with ?? hope as strenght left to finish his goals.
3	In the story, “Do not exceed postal speed limit,” many features of the setting affect the cyclist. First and most importantly, he is affected by the people who live there. “Never accept travel advice from a group of old- timers who haven’t left the confines of their porch since Carter was in office.” This quote describes the feelings the cyclist has towards the old men. Because he listened to their directions, he traveled through ghost towns and hourly died from dehydration. Also, the lack of people and civilization affected the author. There was no one around that he could ask for help from. “…but on that morning it fit the traditional definition of a ghost town. Here, the author is trying to stop for water, but since no one lives in the town any more, he gets none. Finally, the lack of water has a huge effect on the cyclist. “That smoky blues tune “Summer time” rattled around in the dry honey combs of my deteriorating brain.” This describes how the author is really dehydrated and he feels like his brain is drying up. However, his need for water makes him more determined than ever to keep going until he reaches another town, or this goal destination of reaching Yosemite National Park.
1	The features of the setting affect the man in many ways. One way is that when the man notices the terrain starting to change, he becomes more and more distrought. He  sees the sign that sats “ Rough road ahead: Do not exceed pasted speed limit” it is almost as if he thinks the sign is mocking him. Also, when the rider says “ In an @CAPS1 twist that should please all sadists…” he is telling the reader that this situation is very ironic and that he was expecting nothing.
1	IIn the story I read the setting is a big factor to the affect of the cyclist for example it talks about how the cyclist see’s the sign that says, “Rough road ahead! Do not exceed posted speed limit.” So the cyclist has to be cautious
1	The cyclist was is a horrible nasty environment for cycling, but the thing that really threw the cycle off was running out of water. There were no houses to refill his bottle or no one around to give him updated directions. From the heat made him drink more water and also harder to breath in extreme heat. Without those faults the cyclist would have been fine.
2	I think that the features of the setting affected the cyclist in many ways. For example he talks about things that he had to endure while he was riding. For example he had no water so he was parched. There was a huge snake that took up half of the road and there wasn’t a building in sight. So the setting affected him with doubt but he had confidence of getting where he needed to get then when he got there it was a sign of relif. Thats how the setting affected was.
2	The setting in the story affected the cyclist physically and mentally. They affected him physically because of the rough terrain and the heat because he was in a desert and in the mountains. Also because he didn’t follow his plan on the map he had no cloe where he was and so I think the anxiety of the whole thing took a toll on his physical well being. It affected him mentally because every town he passed through, or every building he passed was deserted and he had no idea where any people were so that had to stress him out. This mentally messed him and he thought he was going to die, thats not good for anyone. I really think he should just do what he thinks is right and not listen to crazy old men anymore. Maps don’t go crazy and they don’t really get outdated, and maps don’t lie to you so he obviously learned his lesson.
1	Some of the features like the change in landscape affected the cyclist. Differing from flat land to miniture hills to highways is kind of hard to cope with, especially considering he was dehydrated and had no water.
2	The features of the setting in the essay “Rough Road Ahead.” affected the speaker by presenting challenges such as dehydration, dangerous animals and rough terrain in order to teach him a lesson about following travelling advice from old men. In the essay, he starts out confidently, on his journey after following “their advice”, reasoning that the men sounded “no sense of themselves when pointing out landmarks and spouting off town.&quot; The setting changes from cool to dry and barren with then mention of tumble weeds,” and even changed to dangerous with the appearance of a diamondback snake that blocked his path in the end the setting changes back to comfortable, allowing him to learn his lesson through the hardship of the features of the setting, and follow his own map from then on.
3	The features of the environmental setting is affecting the cyclist. A setting is a certain time and place an event is taking place along with the setting their are features, which is the background description basically giving away additional information about the subject or idea. The features along with the setting are intefering with the cyclist by the hot temperature in Lodi, California making the cyclist or biker hotter than usualier as he heads in the wrong direction closer and nearer to the hot blazen scroaching desert. In addition to this he is running out of water and is beginning to get more and more exhausted from the heat plus he is starting to lose consciousness along with getting dehydrated. This is a major problem for the character because he is losing his sense of direction and because of this he is getting more panickly as his supply of water is running extremely low. A instance of the environmental setting affecting the cyclist is “I eased past, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state. The water bottle contained only a few tantalizing sips. Wide rings of dried sweet circled my skirt, and the growing realization that I could drop from heartstroke on a gorgeous in June &quot;(Joe Kurmaskie, @NUM1).&quot; @CAPS1 example is “This sight was troubling. I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly and I was travelling through the high deserts of California in June “(Joe Kurmaskie, @NUM2)”. The hotness and heat had also increased the character’s confidence in himself as he was getting more and more panickly. A instance of this is “I began breaking the ride down into distances. I could see on the horizon, telling myself that if I could make it this far, I’d be fine “(Joe Kurmaskie, @NUM1). In conclusion, the hot setting in California had affected the cyclist in a number of ways it had exhasted his water supply and this caused him to become exhausted, dehydrated, and making him lose his logically sense to make decisions however his loss of sense of direction also gave him more self confidence as he stirved to the roads and serves town that was about twenty miles away in order to get water so that he @MONTH1 survive.
8	Dear local newspaper, @CAPS1 best friend, @LOCATION2, was once a nerd with no hand-eye coordination, @CAPS2, he started to use a computer and now he has better hand-eye coordination than me. Computer not only teaches hand-eye coordination, but @CAPS3 gives people the ability to learn about far away places and people,and millons people to talk on line with other people. @CAPS1 friend wasn't the only person who learn hand-eye coordination. About @PERCENT1 of people learn hand-eyes coordination using a computer. @CAPS3 might takes some month to learn, but once a child knows @CAPS3, they will be outside for hours. Who would not want to learn hand-eye coordination? In addition, computer gives people the ability to learn about far away places and people. Computer engineer, @PERSON1, says, &quot;@NUM1 in every @NUM2 people learn about places and people threw the internet.&quot; @CAPS3 will take a few hours, but you will be educated. Why would someone think we are spending too much time in the internet if we are being educated? Addionally, don't you have a friend who live more than @NUM3 miles away from you? If you do, @CAPS2 a computer will solve your problem of communication. @CAPS1 friend, @LOCATION1, lives @NUM4 miles away from me. We communicate using hotmail, yahoo, and facebook. The best thing of all is that is free unlike a telephone. Futhermore, computer specialist, @PERSON2, says, &quot;I learned hand-eye coordination using a computer. Most importantly, i was able to hand in @CAPS1 essay on time because of the information a computer provides and i was able to communicate with @CAPS1 family.&quot; I didn't want to tell you this, but i was also a nerd with no hand-eye coordination and i learned just like @LOCATION2 learned. We aren't spending too much time, we are just being educated.
9	Computers are great, they can help you with anything you need. You can shop on then, pay bills, even book a flight to go on vacation, but people are spending too much time on them. They should only spend a certain amount of time on them and not all day. Many people are spending more than enough time on the computer People ran often stay on the computer for hours and not even relize it, they stay up all @TIME1 doing work, or playing games. @TIME1 a while it will eventually take a toll on the body. Because @CAPS2 you are on the machine all day then you are using little to no energy at all. So then you spend @CAPS1 nights in bed tossing and turning. Then that leeds to feelings horrible in the @TIME2, @CAPS2 you do it @TIME1 it is going to have a bad effect on your body. I believe that people who spend all their time on the computer will eventually get overweight. @CAPS2 you are sitting in a chair all day then you get no exercise what so ever. Then when you eat you don't burn off the calories so that leeds to people gaining wait and becoming over wait from that your body becomes very unhealthy and will most likely leed to health issues. When people are on the computer they end up ignoring nature. They miss out on being in the wonderful warmth of the @CAPS3 @CAPS4, or going out and playing in the snow and making @CAPS5, forts, or having a @CAPS6 fight. They even miss out on just going outside and talking a walk the reason is because they are @CAPS7 @CAPS8 inside their house with their fare glued to the computer. Being on the computer takes a lot out on the body. It can cause health problems and even problems in general. So people should just spend a part of their day on the computer. The other part of the day they should be outside, walking around, maybe playing with pets, children or friends. As long as they're out of there chair and not on the computer and getting some exercise.
2	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in the essay “Rough Road Ahead” by Joe Kurmaskie in many ways. One way the setting affected the cyclist way when it got hot and the rider was running out of water. another way the cyclist was affected by the setting was when he said he &quot;could die of heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June simply because of listened to some gentlemen who hadn’t been off their porch in decades caused me to laugh. a third way the cyclist was affected was was when he went inside the bait shop and cooled down. lastly when he rehydrated himself in the  so the setting was a main factory to the cyclist in the essay “Rough Road Ahead” by Joe kurmaskie on his way to Yosemite national park.
2	The cyclist chose to ride through the worst terrain one can ride through. The cyclist rode through deserts and deserted towns. Thats when he started to get thirsty. At first he wasn’t tired or thirsty because he was riding by cool trees and rushing water in the morning. Once he got to the desert part with no water source then he got thirsty and started to drink his water which depleted fast. The lack of a dry place can make you thirsty by itself but after riding a while it became bad. The setting had everything, to do on how the cyclist had no water and thought he was going to die from heatstroke. That’s how the setting affected the cyclist.
2	The setting affected the cyclist mood in the story. The cyclist was riding rough terrain and rolling hills. This made the cyclist feel like his journey was hopeless. When the cyclist arrived at the abandoned @CAPS1 Grape Factory he felt on twist of many. He was extremely thirsty and there used to be a @ORGANIZATION1 build there when the cyclist was a the fock in the road, he thought he could get some water. When this failed the cyclist was even less determined. He felt like the world was against him.
1	The settings effected the cyclist, because where ever he went it seem to never end. Like when he was riding along where the old men told him to go. He went through a ghost town like they said he would go through a town. Then he kept on going but it never end and the summer heat started to get to him. Like when he started to dehidade he this old juice factor and started imagening that he was drinking juice. So he started seeing things.
2	As the author cycles through this shortcut, he is in a very dangerous setting. As said in the poem, he is in the high deserts of California in June. A desert makes the heat unberable for the cyclist. Its just sun, sand, and him. Then it tells the month summer of course makes the temperatures for the cyclist about @NUM1 almost maybe even hotter. This could cause him to drink plenty of water and almost lose all of his water supply. “The water bottle contained only a few tantalizing sips.” Then there is the distance of his ride. The author is always saying “About @NUM2 miles” or “Twenty miles up the road.” All of this hard work can cause heatstroke &amp; kill him.
3	The features of the setting like the dessert the sun and abondered towns affect the cyclist alot. The dry dessert makes him feel as if he were riding forever. And probably makes him wonder if he is ever going to make it to a town. The sun makes hime even  hoter not  he already is makes him sweat more and makes him even more thirsty.The abandoned towns make him lose hope in finding water or even if he is ever doing to make to yosomite. The mood of this story goes from content to sad to happy. He is content after riding to the first town but then the rest of time towns are abandoned too and start to ran out of water an he thinks he is going to die which makes it sad. Then he becomes happy when he finds the bait shop an finds water.
3	In “Rough Road Ahead” by Joe Kurmaskie, the features of the setting affect the cyclist negatively. The story takes place in June in California. This is a very hot time of the year in such a desert location. The heat adds to the speed at which the cyclist becomes dehydrated, as well as his inability to think as coheratly as he could had he not been in a desert in June. The cyclist is also travelling through desolate, an inhabited land. The author says, “There was no one in sight, not a building car, or structure of any kind.” This emphasizes the characters total lack of resources. There is nowhere within sight that he can turn to for help, water, food or shelter. The road was also rough, plagued with many rolling, crippling hills. Such terrain is much harder to manuver, especially in such a are state of despair. The setting of the story, &quot;Rough Road Ahead&quot; greatly impacts the cyclist.
2	There are a lot of things that effect the cyclist, such as the heat, having no water, the rough roads and the long trip. The cyclist is out in a desert so it is very hot. The narriation says, “and the growing realization that I could die drop from heatstroke” (Kurmaskie @NUM1). This means that he or she was very hot and dehydrated. The roads were very rough, for example, “ROUGH ROAD AHEAD: DO NOT EXCEED POSTED SPEED LIMIT” (Kurmaskie @NUM1). The roads became, bumpy, and there were a lot of hill the cyclist had to go over. There was no water either. So he/she was running out of energy and it made it even harder. In the end the cyclist survived and drank a lot of water.
1	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in a very harmful way. The hot temperature and boiling sun made the author hot and took his energy away quicker. The emptiness of the setting can make a person lose hope of finding any civilization. The narrator said, “It was a sad, hopeless laugh, mind you...”(Kurmaskie @NUM1). That is not the last of the harmful setting, the dry desert air has the biggest impact on his llife. The dry air makes him more thirsty for water he doesn’t have making him dehydrate faster. The narrator saids, “I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June” (Kurmaskie @NUM1). The lonely and dreadful features of the setting the cyclist was part of made it so much worse that he had no water.
2	In ‘Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” a cyclist follows some bad advice, which leads him on a tough ride through the desert with little water. The setting has a large effect on the cyclist because it causes him to be dehydrated, which presents the main conflict of the story. “The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips,” the author states when his fresh water supply begins to run out. Another factor the setting presents to the cyclist is the extreme heat of the California desert. This adds to the cyclist thirst and dehydration. The reader can tell it is unpleasantly hot when reading, “wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt…, that I could drop from heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June…” The rough roads and challenging terrain also present a challenge to the cyclist that slows his advance to Yosemite.
8	Dear local newspaper, Computers are a usefull tool when doing a school report or something to that effect but, @CAPS2 we really need thoes computers. When using a computer for a school project @CAPS3 can be a hassel. One of many problems people are fased with while using a computer are freazing, when doing a project and your computer frezz's @CAPS3 can be verry time consumming. Another problem is pop up's, pop up's can couse virouses, and when you computer gets a virous, @CAPS3 leads to becoming very slow. Witch leads us to are next problem slowness, when a computer becomes slow @CAPS3 is verry a digital. There are several problems and risks that come with a computer. One health problem is that you can become a hermet and stay inside all day because your too attached to the computer. Another problem is that you can become verry obease because your not getting any physical exersise. One risks of using a computer is that you could end up getting an fassebook, @CAPS1, or myspase, and meating some one who is protending to be some one there not and get abducted by a molester! There are other alternations you could make instead of using an computer. One alternation is that you could go to the local library and cheak out books on your topick that your wanting information on. Another alternation is to ask teachor if she/he could leand you a class text book. But the main aternation is computer to old fashon books! So now @CAPS3's your choice,&quot;@CAPS2 we realy need computers or can we live with out them?&quot; @CAPS3's your choice!
2	The cyclist is affected by the features of the setting. The cyclists has been pedaling his bike in the direction that the old men told him to go to get to Yosemite. Soon he is out of water and very tired and he believes he will die soon. But then he finds a fish camp, goes in the bathroom to revive himself. when he comes out a man is sittiNg on the porch. The author gets directios from him and is happy that he is on the right track again.
1	There are many affects of the setting in this eassy that, that can be good and or bad. The setting is alone on a empty mountain road, with no house, no cars, no people. In now going to give you some good and bad effects. One good effect is that you by yourself so while you exercise you can relax and enjoy the energy. One bad thing is that what if you pop a tire or need help. You stock because theirs no one around. Another good thing is that you being by yourself, @CAPS1 any cars. You don’t have to worry about getting hit so you’ll be able to just relax and enjoy the ride . Another bad thing is there is no water so you might want to bring plenty with you. So whatever you decide to do just be careful and think you idea thought  
1	The setting or environment the cyclist was in made him feel isolated from the rest of the world. He knew the was no turning back once he started his adventure. No one was their to help him. The environment made him to realize the many risk involved in this adventure. The knowledge that there is no help was his motive to continue on his long journey.
3	The features of the setting make the cyclist feel hopeless after realizing he is not on a short cut. The cyclist has the &quot;growing realization that [he] could drop from heatstroke&quot; as he rides along. Also, the only building he sees for miles &quot;had been @NUM1 Welch's Grape Juice Factory.&quot; The cyclist is driven deeper into despair and feels that all hope is lost when he sees this building. As he rides on, the song &quot;'@ORGANIZATION2' rattled aroung in the dry honeycombs of (his) deteriorating brain.&quot; At this point, the cyclist believes his own death to be inevitable. He saysown death to be inevitable. He says “with any luck I’d hit a bump and lodge one in my throat” when talking about pebbles he placed in his mouth. Finally, the cyclist reaches a small bait shop, and all hope is returned as he “drank deeply from the sink.” The desert setting, with its lack of water, shelter, and people was the cause of this mans concern and later panic about his own life. The hopelessness of this cyclist is much like the hopelessness of those in the @ORGANIZATION1, who trapped in a blizzard far from civilization, resorted to eating their dead just to survive. While the @PERSON1 @ORGANIZATION1 went to extremes for their survival, their setting caused them to feel the same hopelessness as the cyclist.
2	In the essay “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” the features of the setting affects the cyclist because he has to cross different types of land marks. First, he got information from the old people. For example, when he showed the map to the old people their only going to know the old short cuts not the new ones. Second, when he ran out of water. For instance, when the cyclist ran out of water he had to climb hills and that tired him out. Plus when he tried to get water from that one thing only hot water come out last, when he finally got to a story the old guy had a map. For example, when he asked the old guy about the place he was going to he said I have my own map. So therefore he knew he was in trouble. In  conclusion, this is how the features of the setting affects the cyclist.
1	The features of the setting effected the cyclist in many ways. The setting was verry hot and there were a lot of hills. The cyclist had been riding up and down hills all day and it took a lot of energy when he saw the building that he thought could help him he said, “... last burst of energy, i mane'uvered down the hill,” By saying that it showed that the setting of where he was contained a lot of hillsy and they effected him by taking up all his energy. That is how the setting had effected the cyclist.
3	In the short story Rough Road ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted  Limit, by Joe Kurmaskie, the features of the setting affects the cyclist. When at the old codgens house, he is confident in himself, because they have told how of a shortcut to Yosemite, giving that confidence he needs, as he leaves, he is still confident, these as the settings changes, so does the mood of the cyclist. after &quot;about @NUM1 miles into te pedal&quot;, the cyclist arrives at the first town, he has despair because it is a ghost town,&quot; still having confidence, he lack of water, he continues on. after a couple more miles, he comes to small fork with a pump. Thinking its cool, water he goes and pump, he finds out it is @NUM2°@CAPS1 and tastes like &quot;battery acid&quot;. Now he desparate, no water, dehydrated, and no towns around, he began to pedal and pedal, hoping to find a town around. When he does find a town, with water, the setting to relieving and better for him because he find water. In the end, the setting effect how the cyclist back against confident, then desperate as water is used, than relieved when water is found.
1	This would be a hard risk to begin with, but the cycalist is taking it in the desert. As we all know, the desert can get boiling hot, so a bike ride could get enjoyable quickly. Also, when the only thing you see for miles is rode, sand and an empty factory, your moral can easily dray quickly. It’s just an overall way setting to give lost in.
1	The effect of cyclist is very and treding becose alot of thing can go worrs like you can feel so hot have and water wouldn’t cool down it didn’t matter. But when drop in you mouth had the flavor of battery acid. He or anyone could just drop from a heatstroke on a gorgeus day in June. So hot that you are seeing thing like a town hot pouring a refeshing glass of juice into his mouth could still leave.  
1	The features of the setting dramatically affected the cyclist. He started out in a confident mood, until he arrived at a town that was deserted. His confidence was still pretty high but not like it was prior to coming upon the ghost town. Twenty miles up the road after that, he came to a fork in the road which contained a ramshackle shed rusty, unclean pumps, and a small corral. The desert was hot and his lack of water was dehydrating him. Paragraph @NUM1 states, “This sight was troubling…I had been hitting my water bottles regularly, and was traveling through the high deserts in California.” With little water and a short energy supply he was getting tired and dehydrated quickly. The land started turning into rolling hills and caused him to become even more exhausted. His mood had gone from confident to hopeless. He even planned on changing a diary entry in case he died of heatstroke. The features obviously greatly affected the mood of the cyclist. Sometimes disappointment can come from taking the so-called “easy way out.” 
10	Computers. They are an amazing marvel of science that greatly benefits man-kind today. But computers can be good or bad depending on how you use them. Homework can be made easier, connecting with others is easier, and entertainment like @CAPS1 and video games are a click away. On the otherhand, Computers can be distracting, addicting, and tiring. It is important to know the pros and cons of computers. For example, the search engine, @ORGANIZATION1, is an easy to use website that can be very helpful. If there is a concept or problem that you are having trouble with, just type it into @ORGANIZATION1 and links to websites pop up that will help answer anything that you would like to know. There is also a website called @LOCATION1. This website is an all purpose dictinary, @CAPS2, encyclopedia and translator. I even have an application for it on my cellphone. But technology can also be distracting. Social networking websites, like facebook, games websites like @CAPS3, and also websites like @CAPS4 can be very tempting and distracting when you should be doing homework. Procrasination is very easy to give into. But self control is the only way to avoid this problem. Budgeting your time so that you can do both your homework, and go on the computer is also very important. One thing that I find very useful on computers is an online textbook. We are lucky enough today that most large books can be formated onto a computer. Instead of carrying a @NUM1-pound text book, you can just use a @NUM1 megabyte book on the internet. This makes travel to and from school much easier. That, and textbooks often use up a lot of desk space, but all you nneed is the space that a computer will consume anyway. Studying is also made easier this way. All of the things that a computer can do are great. But this can also keep us from going outside, excersising, and seing real people in real life. This need for the computer can be bad. We are too connected as a society. Our status, feelings, friends, and position in life are always needing to be updated. Distractions are everywhere. Facebook, for instance, is very addicting. You are looking at a virtual landsacape. Self control really is the only way to get off the computer and step into the real world. Overall, computers are great, but you have to know when, and how long to use it. It has several benefits such as entertainment, communication, and information. But all of these things can be just as distracting as they can be helpful. Knowing this. I hope that society can think of the pros and cons of the computer.
3	In the story the setting affected the cyclist all through the story till he arrived at body and wilbers fish camp. As the man rides his bike for a while he is of but as he road into the first town it seemed to be a ghost town. As he pedal on “ The sun was beginning to beat down but I barely noticed it“. At that time the wheater is affecting him a lot but he keeps Yosemite cool pines and rushing rivers in his head He also only had only a few tantalizing sips left in his water bottle while going up a big hill.
1	The setting of this Essay is to tell cyclest were to go without getting them lost and to never take advice from old people.
2	The features in the setting greatly affect the cyclist, the setting was hot and rough terrain and he was tired and thirsty. The cyclist said, “over one long, crippling hill, a building came into view.” He this means that he needed water so much and the hill was so big that he needed water. Also he says, “Summertime “rattled around in the dry honey combs of my deteriorating brain”. It is summer time where he is riding and to keep his mind off of his thirst, he hums the song “summertime” He wants to show that the heat cannot overtake his body. Also he says, “At some point, tumble weeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake.” He is saying that the terrain is deadly because of the snake that passed by him. He needed to show with all objections, he could overcome anything. As you can see the setting greatly affected the cyclist.
3	Many things can affect a cyclist. But in the story three main features of the setting affected the cyclist the most. While the cyclist was riding it was very hot. We know this by looking back at the text. It gives us this quote, “That I could drop from heat stroke on a gorgeous day in June.” Because it was hot. This could make the cyclist thirsty. Another feature of the setting was the multitude of hills. This would create exhaustion. We know their were many hills because in the text it says.” Flat road was replaced by short rolling hills.” Going over all those hills can really tire someone out. A third feature of te setting would be nature. Nature can affect us in many ways, by weather, by terrain, as in this case by animals. In the story the cyclist comes upon a large snake. This making it dangerous. The setting can affect anything. It would have been a totally different story if the cyclist had been in the summer during @DATE1, not June.
3	In the essay “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed @CAPS1,” the setting is used to alter the cyclists mood and as a reflection of his situation. For example, the statement “the cool pines and rushing river of Yosemite had my name written all over them” helps describe the cyclist situation. The idea of lush, cool water vegetation gives the @CAPS4 hope during his increasinlgly hellish trip. The beauty of that setting also reflects on the comfort that would come from reaching Yosemite; the good setting equal a good out come. Later on, the cyclist comes across “one ramshackle shed, several rusts pump, and a corral that couldn’t hold in the lamest make.” This is a depressing setting symbolizing a complete loss of hope. And inteact at this point the cyclist becomes troubles to his situation. While pedaling through desert, the cyclist becomes even more factory when tumble seed, which is always a symbol of a deserted area, cones by. The nile of setting to affect and mirror mood is nothing new. There are many examples of this literary technique throughout history. For example, in his story “The @CAPS2 of @CAPS3 @PERSON1.” @CAPS4 @PERSON1 was a deslated land filled wild beast to symbolize and cause @PERSON2 to change his personalith surrounded by uncivilized people and creating @PERSON2 tears of his clothes and hunt like a dog. The setting of a desert in the uncultured. Part of colonial simultaneously cause and reflects on this change. The setting in the essay “Do Not Exceed posted Speed Limit” is used as an important for character development.  
3	The features of the essay explain how the features of the setting affect the cyclist for many reasons. When the author writes tumbleweeds crossed my path” it shows that he is most likely in the middle of nowhere. This is true because tumbleweeds are usually signs in movies and t.v. shows that the place is deserted. Also, when the author writes” the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke” and when he writes “a ridiculously large snake” show the growing danger that he is getting himself into. This is true because the snakes could get a tany time or he could just collapse from the lack of water and die. Lastly, the name of the store is revelant because it is a fish bait store and he is thirsty. This is revelant because fish live in water and he is thirsty and seeing the sign relieves him completely. Therefore, the features of this essay explain how the features of the setting affect the cyclist.
2	The cyclist is faced with many challenges on his journey to Yosemite, one of which is travelling through the California deserts. This was quite a challenge because a desert is very hot and dry, plus the author was riding his bike, making  himself more thirsty and hot. He also encountered a big snake that appeared to be a diamondback which he avoided even though it almost covered the road. The author also had to deal with rough terrain when he rode his bike through the hills. The biker met the challenges and progressed through them with bravery.
1	In the essay “Rough Road Ahead: Do not exceed Speed limit” this many different settings took its toll on the cyclist. For example in the beginning he started out with a nice smooth ride. But it was very hot. Then he began to get into a hort rolling hills which were taking thier toll on his legs. Then we entered into a rough are where he had to be more careful. The roughness prolly wore him out from all the bumps and bounces. He went through a lot on that bike trip, who know he @MONTH1 have never made at back to where he was staying.
2	The features of the setting affect the cyclist by making it harder for him to pedal and complete his ride. For example, “flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.” This should make his trip harder because instead of being able to pedal at one consistent rate the whole time, he would have to start pedaling harder and easier over and over again, using more energy. Another example is, “through the high deserts of California in June.” This makes it harder for him because he has to do all his work in a scorching summer heat. Finally, the first three stops he made had no where to fill his water bottles, take a drink, or cool off. This would make it hard because he is becoming dehydrated during his whole trip. These are some features of the setting that affect the cyclist by making his trip harder.
1	One feature that effected the cyclist was the rolling hills. The  “text states “ two miles into the section... I noticed  the terrain changing…
8	To the Local Newspaper, Computers have a heavy impact on, todays society. People depend on them a lot but same people disagree. I think that computers have a positive affect on people. Computers are very entertaining. They can help find long lost friend and keep in contact with them. Plus they can be helpful with homework. Please proceed on reading to see as why I chose these resons. Firstly, computers can entertain. The are thousands of games to chose from. Dress up to educational. Which are good for young children of age five through six. As it states in the writing prompt it teaches hand-eye coordination. In addition to my first reason, computers help long lost friends. There are websites that help you find people. For example @CAPS1, @CAPS2, and yahoo. These websites help keep in touch to, with family. If theres no phone then theres always the computer. Lastly, computers can be helpful with homework. Sometimes you don't even need internet theres a calculator built right in! But a nationwide website thats used and children improve from it is edhelper.com. This website does work sheets and helps with the level the child is on. In conclusion, I think that computers do have a good impact on people. They are entertaining, keeps in contact, and helpful with homework. Please take my reasons into consideration.
2	In the essay “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” the setting affects the story very much for many reasons. First, it is in the summer, so it is very hot. Also, it is in the desert in the west, so there is a very warm climate already. Third, there is not any civilization on the “shortcut” he follows, so there is no way for the author to get any water to replenish his body with. This is how the features of the setting affect the cyclist in the story.
1	The setting affects the cyclist a lot, because is it was windy too it would be had for the cyclist to control the bike. So is  too has a lot as buildings and people outside their would be a lot as traffic so they would not  be allowed to let the cyclist go there so the cyclist would  has to turn back. Then if it was a clear road  and nobody was there ad no bulidings or houses were there then it wold be an easy ride for the cyclist. So as you can see the setting affects the cyclist in many ways.
2	The cyclist was affected majorly by a few dreadful parts of the setting. In the beginning, when it was not as hot and he had plenty of water, the cyclist was absolutely fine. As the day went on, he felt the heat bearing down on him. He drank all his water, and now he felt desperate. His mood changed with the setting, and he was extremely happy once he reached Gary and @ORGANIZATION1. Also, this cyclist decided to blame the old men for giving him bad directions when he was in trouble, but he thanked them once he realized they were correct.
3	If it’s a good day the cyclist will want to rid. If it is a bad day then they will not want to but probably will.
1	In the essay, Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit by Joe Kurmaskie, features of setting affect the cyclist because there is old people that been around for along time and you can’t ask for advice because they’re to old old to give information and wouldn’t know what their talking about. “A better piece of advice for the solo cyclist would be, “Never accept travel advice from a collection of old-timers who haven’t left the confines of their porches sine Carter was in office.” That is the features of the setting and examples from the essay.
3	The features for the cyclist in rough road ahead is not the kind l’D  war a be in at forts. I thought it was going to be  a scenery story but it turns out he want that prepared. He took directions from some olden guys who haven’t left their house sense carter was in office. He was a bike peddaling threw the California desert with the things you can carry cause your on a bike. He ran out of water and could of got heatstroke or colapsed in the middle of nowhere with no one around to save him. So the heat gone drive you insane and make you thirty and you have a bite. The conditions this biker is in  hormone and I dont think he was prepared. Always stick in your gut.
1	In the story the fact that no one was around, there were no buildings, he had no water, and was lost. Had a negative affect on the cyclist, he was doubting himself the whole time. Although he did perserver and made it through the tough situation he was in.
2	In the story “rough road ahead” the setting and the features affect the cyclist. For example in the story he says “I’d read once that sucking on stones helps take your mind off thirst by allowing what spit you had left to circulate”. This shows that the features are rough because he would most likely not be that desperatly thirsty unless it was very hot out. The setting and features of this story is it takes place in California, on a hot day. Another quote that could support the question is when the author says, “I wiped the sweat from my eyes to make sure it wasn’t a mirage.” This shows that it is hot because he is sweating. This also could show that it is hot because he thinks it’s a mirage, and people usually see them in the desert, where it is hot.
2	In the essay ”Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” by Joe Kurmaskie, the features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. To begin, the as the cyclist rode on for the first miles, he did not see anything in sight. This made him less determined to reach his goal. Then, in paragraph @NUM1, the cyclist saw a building which helped him to gain strength to reach his goal. The cyclist’s determination went down as long as he was riding. But then at last he came to a building that gave him relief and more confidence in himself.
2	The features of the setting affects the cyclist by him dehydrating and running out of time and energy. ”I eased past trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state” This quote proves the dehydration of the rider. “The glowing realization that I could die from a heat stroke,” this quote proves the time and energy of the rider is running out. These ideas and quotes show the features of the setting of the cyclist.
9	Dear local Newspaper, To my understanding computers have been putting a bad effect on people of all ages. In my opinion staying on the computer all day can cause you to miss out on outdoor activities. Also if you sit on a chair all day, honestly what will happen to you? You will become less active. In past experiences I have learned that if you get interested in computer game it will come very addicting. Computer put negative affects on people of all and I think we should stop and think about what we are doing. Most likely if you stay on the computer all day you will indeed on activities such as sports. @CAPS2 example @PERCENT1 of americans play soccer. In the beatiful fall when the leaves are beatifully changing you will miss out on playing soccer and the beaty of the leaves because of the computer you can't get your eyes off of. Another breathtaking adventure that you @MONTH1 miss out on is hiking. Hiking can be amazing when you get to the top and you see on the houses that have people like you (cach potatoes) sitting inside on the computer. Simple activities can be lost because of an addicting game you call fun. The computer is like a cause and effect. You @MONTH1 think you just playing farm town or chating on facebook, but in feture you will be missing out on the beauty of nature and sports. To connect @CAPS1's with missing out on sports because of the computer that will cause you to become over weight. A recent study showed that @PERCENT2 of children are obeased because of computer games. You @MONTH1 be thinking how, but I have a friend named named, @PERSON1 and he used to love to play out side and play sports until came out @CAPS2 the computer. Now he way @NUM1 pounds and he is only @NUM2. Honestly sitting in a chair all day will cause you to not be active and gain weight. Do you want this to happen to you? Help me tell others how computers cause a negative effect on others. Lastly playing on the compter or chatting with friends on @ORGANIZATION1 can cause you to @CAPS2 example if your talking to your girlfriend in spain who is there @CAPS2 callage I garentee your going to put off school work, @CAPS3 and other @CAPS4 that need to be done. In the end it will end up being time @CAPS2 bed and you got nothing done weather it was because you were trying to get to level @NUM3 or talking with your girlfriend you will have nothing accomplished. If your not yet a resent scientific study reported that six hours on the computer per day @CAPS2 one week can @CAPS5 your vision from a @NUM4 @NUM4 to @NUM6 @NUM6. If you keep it up now it @MONTH1 not seem bad but @NUM8 hours looking at the computer can kill your eyes. Would you rather be blind or not use the computer because or what could happen? All in all the computer is a bad thing such as useful piece of technology can cause you to miss out on events such as sports. Also it leads to being overweight sense your not getting active. Finally the computer is bad @CAPS2 your eyes and can cause you to procastonate. Help me help yourself avoid all of these bad effects caused from the computer.
2	In the story Rough Road Ahead the author takes a trail he had previously heard about. After the ride didn’t turn out to be what he expected it to be, the setting began to “set in”. The aridity of the climate would cause the author to have to struggle against himself and the conditions around him. Also his lack of water was a problem to begin with. Also his lack of water was a problem to begin with but the scorching sun would make him become dangerously dehydrated.
3	The  cyclist  runs  into some pretty tough challenges. The real vies of the setting affected him, because there was so many optical that he had to overcome, for  example, he  got directions  from some old men who move then lively didn’t really know what they were talking about. Then he ran out of water so he had nothing to drink and the road started to get bumpily and he saw snakes. There were no buildings nor cars around so he had no way of asking anybody for help if needed. He came  up on an old factory, that was thought to be the Welch’s Grape juice, factory, but was abandoned and looked like it had been for a while, towards the end he found this fish came where he finally got water and was around people. These different optical affected his mood and how determined he was.
2	The setting in “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Speed Limit” has a great effect on the main character in the story. In the beginning of the story, he passes the first ‘town’ and continues riding his bike, following the directions some old folks gave him. “The cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite had my name written all over it.” His mood at this point was already confident, but this adds to it, with words like “rushing” being encouraging to him. Then, he continues moving on the road. “Not two miles into this section of the ride, I noticed the terrain changing.” At this point, he is becoming unsure of how good the directions he obtained really were. Once he is already tired, rolling hills isn’t what he wanted to find, so this adds to his doubt. Further along, he said, “There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind. “This adds to the despair he was feeling, because he feels he is going to die in Yosemite. Not seeing anyone was probably extremely discouraging, so the setting really affected him. Then he said “over the long crippling hill, a building came into view.” It is at this point that he uses the word “crippling” because he is just about exhausted and can’t go any further.
2	The features in the setting greatly affect the cyclist. He is riding through this deserted and beaten up town that makes him feel weird. After that he starts to ride through the desert when a huge snake gets in his way and scares him even more. When he arrives at the abandoned juice factory he is almost completely out of energy and almost can’t go on any further in his journey until he finally arrives at the bait shop. Most of the features in the setting scare the cyclist but they all affect him.
1	The cyclist was begging to feel that death was coming his way as he continued withought a building in sight. This made him grow histerical over the situation, and still have enough energy to feel sorry for himself. Then when he finally did see a building he thought it was a mirage.
2	The location of a cyclist’s ride affects the person’s attitude and strength. If the road is full of hills, it takes a little more strength to maintain speed. When put in this situation, Kurmaskie writes “It was a sad, hopeless laugh, mind you, but at least I still had the energy to feel sorry for myself.” This shows how one gets drained by hills. Also, being in a desert situation can weaken a cyclist due to thirst.The cyclist in the reading was desperate enough to try pump water that looked “brackish.” So, setting can break a cyclist.
1	The setting in the passage is working against the cycler. Hes running low on water hes almost dehydrated and the weather were hes at is very very hot and he cant see a town for miles.
2	The features of the setting affects the cyclist because it was really hot out, he had very little amount of water, and a long way to go. The temperature was so hot, the cyclist said he felt dehydrated. He also had to go over a lot of hills and go through deserts to get where he needed to go. He took a “shortcut” but it ended up taking longer and he got dehydrated. This is how the setting affected him.
0	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in the good way. For examples he would be in good shape because cycling is a sport. He would be rich because he would win the contest of cycling.
2	In the essay by Joe Kurmaskie many obstacles are caused from the diffrent settings. For example, the hot temperature caused the character to get dehydrated. He recalled “ I eased past, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state. ” This caused the loss of determination, which led to him lossing his consciousness. The hills he had to cycle also effected him. They caused him to become tired and weak and to lose his determination, as well. Just like the temperature problem, the loss of determination could eventually  make him lose consciousness. He said “ if it looked like i was going to lose consciousness for the last time.”  
7	Dear editor, I beleve that people should have computers, The resons are it dosen't take @NUM1 days to email. You can learn about faraway places. Also you can talk to people around the world. After looking at these detail most people are likly to agree. Firstly it dosent take @NUM1 days to email you can email someone and it takes five seconds to get to the other person. While regular mail takes @NUM1 day to a week to get to another person. When you email some one and then the email you back it saves the and government money. Email is much fasters than the mall or I like to call it snail mail. Another reson is that you would be able to learn about diffrent contrys faraway and near. Would you be able to about @LOCATION1 from you living rooms without computers. No you wouldnt't. Without computers would you be able to learn about the earth quake in chile. No you wouldent. Compters are modern day telivision for kids. Lastly you can talk to people on the computer there is many ways to talk to people like facebook, myspace, aim, and vidio chat you don't have to call some one on the @CAPS1 when you can jus vidio chat with them. In conusion computers are good. You can email fast. You can learn about foreinge contrys in you living room. You can also chat with people online. I think computers are good what about you.
1	The setting of the story had effected the cycle’s becuse if it was sub earbs he could have stoped any where and got water but the plot was in a middle of a desert and all he could do is keep rolling and hoping to find some water For example, he had to go @NUM1 miles to get to the next town to get water and if he was not in the desert with hills he could have made that in no time at all    
1	The cyclist was affected by many features of the setting. The flat road soon became bumpy hills, which were made harder to cycle because of lack of water. The hot desert sun and lack of towns and people also made the journey difficult.
2	The features of the setting effect the cyclist because it is to hot. It is hot enough that his water tasts like battery acid.  Then he has to deal with difficult trails breakway he said “old-timers who haven’t left the confines of their porches since Carter was in office.” This is sayin that the old-timers gave him old directions. Plus what made the setting even hotter was he has been cycling nonstop. Then when he was riding he said “The cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite had my name written all over it.” With him thinking about this it made him forget about the heat. This was why the setting was affecting the cyclist.
2	There are many reasons as to why the features of the setting affects the cyclist. One reason is because it is so hot, I know this because it was sammertime in the California desert. Another reason is because the road was very rough. I know this because of the sign that he saw that said “Rough Road Ahead; Do Not Exceed Posted Speed @NUM1). This tells you that the road is very rough. And being that he is on a bike rough roads are not very good for him. Another reason as to why the setting affects the cyclist is that there is no one to get directions from. There is no one around to give him a drink of water. These are few of the many reasons why the setting affects the cyclist.
1	The setting of this story is outside. Yosemite is outside riding her bike. She is around hills, no water, and very hot land. You know that she is around hills because she says to herself, “… I maneuvered down the hill.” You also know that she starts of around no??? ???good water. “When I tried a drop or two, it had the flavor of battery acid…” that shows the water was bad. Also the land is very hot because it says “…in the??? ???of two hundred degrees.” Yosemite starts off bad then ends up learning to stick to it and never give up. Yosemite’s biggest problem is her lack of water due to the fact that it is hot outside and the water she had was bad, tasting like battery acid. 
1	There are many things that could affect affect the cyclist. Like when they said ,” tomble weeds crossed my path is a ridiculously large snake.” @CAPS1 her example would be when they said” Not two miles into this next section of the ride I noticed the terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills. That is how the features of the setting affect the cyclist.
1	The stoy of the cyclist features of the setting affect of the cyclist, The cyclist had to go thoug a lot &quot; The speed limit was @NUM1. The was doing a water depleting @NUM2, Sometimes life can feel so cruel.” The cyclist love ride their bike they enjoyed the serenity of an early summer evening&quot; to cycling.
3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist. First, the river and the pine trees “The cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite had my name written all over them&quot;. Thinking about that helped the cyclist keep going. Second, the road was getting harder to travel. “Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills&quot; and a sign on another road said “rough road ahead” The roads made the cyclist work harder to get to Yosemite National Park. Finally, the cyclist's water supply was running low. “the water bottles contained only a few tantalizing  sips.” Not having a lot of water is really bad when your outside in the heat and the cyclist had no idea where to find more. The towns the cyclist ran into were abandon or “ghost town”. The cyclist had nowhere to go to get help. This cyclist faced many problems during his bike ride to Yosemite national park.
2	The older men gave him directions that were acctully really bad. Nature wasn’t on is side that’s for sure. First of all he ran out of water because of the heat. Secondly a snake blocked his path and he didn’t want to tempt it. Thirdly he became so overheated that it was possible for him to suffer a heat stroke in the middle of nowhere. Also he kept going to abandoned buildings. It was so bad that the stone relied on for his thirst got stuck in his throat, he was then lead to a bait shop that was absolutely in the middle of nowhere and he had no way of getting home.
2	The features of the setting affected the cyclist. The dry desert affected the cyclist because these was no water and the cyclist was dehydrated. The strong heat, because the cyclist could bare had a heat stroke. The animals because the snake could have killed the cyclist and these was no one in miles to help. In the story it says, “These was no one in sight, not a bulling, car or structure of any kind,” If the cyclist had needed help then the  cyclist could most likely have died. if I was the cyclist, I probably would have given up by then but I’m glad the cyclist didn`t. The features of the setting affected the cyclist because of the many things that could make happened to him.
8	Dear @CAPS1, Have you ever used a computer to do anything besides buisness? Well if not then when you are not busy you should try it. The effects computers have on people is that it's a lot of fun to go on and play, helpful with mostly anything, and you can find just about anything from websites on clothing to maps to the store location. There are three reasons why you should agree with me and these reasons are people have the right to choose what they want to, in this weather it's a little bit to cold to go out and enjoy nature, lastly they can interact with friends and familys online on a website. People have the right to choose what they do because the goverment can't choose for you since they're busy with other more important stuff. Also in the constitution it states that the goverment can't choose for us while we have the power to think. In this weather it's cold to go out, plus nature is so much better in the @DATE1 and the @DATE2 where it's not to hot to cold and thats when the sun is good thats when people should enjoy nature. With all the technology in todays world it's better to take advantage of the technology in this world, also the technology we have is helping people like generators because in old times people didn't have generators. So I hope this letter has changed your opinion and thank you for reading it.
2	The features of the setting that affected the cyclist was the heat because he was getting lost and he was slowly running out of water. The cyclist said, “That you should never accept travel advice from old timers that haven’t left their porches since Carter was in office”. This means that because the cyclist followed their advice he got lost in the desert and was running very low on water. He was thirsty that he put stones in his mouth to keep him from thinking about water. In the end the cyclist learned to trust the map and the signs instead of listening to really old people who haven’t left their homes in years.
2	The setting of the desert is a hard setting to be in with no water or help. If the author would have been on a population trait with water fountain and shade, he would have been fine. But, he was in the desert no one around, hot, dry, no water, and no shade. ”tumbleweeds crossed my path“ (@CAPS1 @NUM1). This dicride his loneleness because no one was in the desert to help him. The setting could have killed him if it was not for the fish camp. The setting had a huge affected on the author.
2	The feature in the short story affect the cyclist because with no towns around there is now water. In the story is says, “The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips.” This means the cyclist was short on water and needed to find a town soon. Cycling in the desert and up down hills made it harder and hotter. The heart could cause dehydration or a heatstroke because it says, “and the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke” the buildings the cyclist did see were not any help to him because they had no water. Eventually he came to a fishing camp and found water in the sink of the bathroom. The story says, “I stumbled into a rather modern bathroom and drank deeply from the sink.” This is where the setting changes because the cyclist found cool water finally.
3	In “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit”, the author faces many obstacles because of the different terrain changes on his journey to Yosemite National Park. Taking advice from a group of old men, he headed to his first stop. The old men said he would see a town but what he really saw was a sort of ruined &quot;ghost&quot; town. Then he came to a fork in the road and was running out of water. He had been riding on flat road when the terrain dramatically changed. It became hilly and very inconsistent. This sudden change in terrain caused him to get more tired, thirsty, and hot. The cyclist then came to a huge hill and, using his last bit of energy, rode down. He was exhausted. All the terrain changes not only changed the cyclist’s physical state, but his mood and determination as well.  
2	The setting affect the cyclist in many ways. &quot;The journey nass make an snake this quote and that there made it seem like he is in the middle of know were and is ulcoming no plass because the man on the pourch said it would not be to far. The first town also was empty and when saw the town he was excited to go and feel a little out when he got closer he realized that the town has been abandoned this whole time so he was forced to keep going out the empty town made him feel almost hopless. In his attempts to make it to that next town, that how the setting mos affected the cyclist in the way that it did.
2	The setting of the road affected the cyclist in many different ways. Because there were no towns on the road it made it very difficult for him to find water which led him into a dehydrated state. “The old guys had sworn the next town was only eighteen miles down the road I would conserve my water and go inward for an hour or so. The rolling hills of the road were making him use more energy. Because there was no buildings for miles be broke the ride into short distances
2	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in so many ways. Some ways the cyclist was affected is, the lack of water was the biggest problem he had. The group of the old guys that gave him directions werent a big help at all. The men gave the cyclist directions be what they remember when they were younger in age. The cyclist knew not to take directions from the old men, but they seemed so sure about what they were talking about to him. The cyclist first had determination to get to his destination. As he begin to get hotter and more thirster into giving up. As soon as he was about to give up his troubles, thirst, and fear were all behind him now. He stumbled across water.
2	The features in the setting affect the cyclist in many different ways. One way is he is round stuck with only a little bit of water. “The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips.(Kurmaskie). Also the cyclist was lost because of the old men directions that got him know where because there directions were out of date. “Never accept travel advice from a collection of old-timers who haven’t left the confine of their porches since carter was in office,” (Kurmaskie @NUM1). He was giving bad directions and wasnt to pleased. Therefore the cyclist went through some though times.
1	Different features of the settings affect the cyclist. The setting of the story, which is based in the desert has a negative affect on the character. “The desert land is baron, leaving him only with his small supply of water. During his journey he runs out of water causing him to lose contact with reality. The extreme heat in the desert causes him to begin to hallucinate. The cyclist begins to see a grape juice factory, which interrupts his trip. To his dismay, it turns out to be a no more than a mirage. The lengthy road also affected the trip. The length and roughness of the road had worn the cyclist down.
3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because he thinks after a nice afternoon in a nice campground a shortcut to his next destination would be very nice. He thinks the shortcut will be a nice way to relax than to take the original longer way to Yosemite. But the trip he makes changes his mind a lot. In the essay the narrator is talking about what the old guys had told him. He says, “The old guys had sworn the next town only eighteen miles down the road. I could make that. I would conserve my water…” He did conserve his water but the town was very old and didn’t have any water for him to drink. So throughout the essay the narrator went without water until he got to a factory, got some water to drink, and got new directions. The trip was very different from what he had expected. It was more depressing.
8	Dear Newspaper @CAPS1, @CAPS2 opion in thig is that, computer are used all the time. People use them to talk to friends and family online. People also use computers for home work online. And the last rason I say computer are used is just for fun stuff game you can play. I use the computer to look how @CAPS2 teams are doing. Now on to more about why. Computers are good for society, because people use computers to talk to friends and family on @CAPS3, @CAPS4 and @CAPS5. This is a good reson becuase we all have family. So I think that this is a good way to talk to them. An for friends this is a good way because if they move you can talk to them on this. The reson it a bad thing is because people like older men can use the computer for child pornarapy and talk to younger girls about sex and thats not right. Now on to more about using computer for homework. The reson computers are good to us is because people can use there computers for homework. This is good because if you need to do something on our history then that what thats good for this is good because everything you need is on a computer. Now on to more about how computer are good to society. @CAPS2 @CAPS8 reson is because computer are good for fun stuff. Computer can have every game you want they have kid games, @CAPS2 @NUM1 year old sister goes on to the games that you can match. Teenagers can play games on the computer. The compter for me is cool because I can see how @CAPS2 football team is doing. Ho @CAPS2 @CAPS7 are doing. This is why the computer are good. These are @CAPS2 opion on this is that compter are used all the time peopl use them to talk to frend and family online. Peope also use computer for homework. Finally last and @CAPS8 reson is because you can use it for fun games for kids. An I can check how @CAPS2 teams are doing. 
0	A response that explains how the feature of the setting affected the cyclist. Would be that in the setting in the setting affected cyclist because for one the features of setting was based on something else. So that would be a reason how it would be affected. Because they're is differences in the stories.
0	You came alway choose your features because you idea mind be change over time.
3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist mentally, physically, positively and negatively. For instance, had been do @CAPS1's Grape Juice Factory and bottling plant. A sandblasted picture of a young boy by pouring a refreshing glass of juice into his mouth could still been seen.&quot; This affected the author mentally, making him remember he had no water. Which inturn affected him physically by becoming dehydrated as moments passed. So overall that setting features had a negative direction affect on the cyclist. Another example, &quot;One ramshacked shed, several rusty pumps, and a coral that couldn't hold in the lamest mule greeted me. This sight was troubling.&quot; This affected the cyclist mentally by making him think he was never going to see civilization again. It also affected him physically because the water tasted like &quot;battery acid&quot; which put him deeper into his dehydration state. This setting features had a negative affect on the cyclist. The setting features and had they affected the cyclist is like an environment a person is adised in and how it makes them who they are.
3	He is going on a journey on his bike. He has to go down hills and deal with the factt that has has no water. That’s basically what the setting is about.
2	When riding a bike the features around you can affect the cyclist. Some things that can affect the cyclist are weather and scenery. If the weather is cold and rainy the cyclist would not want to be riding. The dangers of riding when the weather conditions are bad will make the cyclist second guest: riding or not. If the weather is extremely hot the cyclist will get dehydrated quicker and even more exhasted. The scenery can also affect the cyclist. When a cyclist is riding and all he/she sees is a desert then they might have doubts on where there going. If there are abandon buildings everywhere the cyclist @MONTH1 become frighten and want to head back of lose hope as shown in the story “Do not exceed the speed limit” when he gets over a hill and begins to think that he will never make it to Yosemite. Many things can affect the cyclist.
2	The features of the setting exhuberate the cyclist. The June weather added to the water depletion, being the beginning of summer, when the cyclist “arrived at the first ‘town’&quot; it was deserted, and the water had disgusting water. The author uses verbal irony when calling it a town “town” having it not really be a town anymore. The large snake presented an air of danger and another abandoned Grape Juice Factory added to the hopeless lost tone. 
2	Many things in the setting affect the cyclist. The first thing that affects him is the heat. The heat is actually what causes the conflict in the story of the cyclist needing water. If the heat was not present in the story than the cyclist would not have such a need for water and he would be able to continue on his ride without fear of dehydration. Another aspect of the setting that affect the cyclist are the rolling hills. These hills also exhaust the cyclist and cause him to need more water. If these hills were gone than the cyclist would have tirerd less quickly making his journey easyer. The setting in this story greatly affects the cyclist.
3	The features of the setting in, &quot;Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” affect the cyclist in many ways. After following the old mens' advice he sets off on his journey. After the first town appears the sun realy starts to beat down which realy affects the cyclist. In the essay it says “The sun was beginning to heat beat down, but I barely noticed it.” He @MONTH1 have not noticed it yet but then later on the long winding road on the new flat terrain he runs out of water and that is real dangerous in weather that hot. The text says, “The speed limit was @NUM1. I was doing a water- depleting @NUM2.” In this part of the story it proves that the cyclist is out of water. In this kind of setting you can run into dangerous creatures. In the story it says, “I toiled on. At some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake. It really did look like a diamondback-blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me.” This entry proves to the reader that there are snakes in this sort of setting. The features of the setting in “Do not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” affects the cyclist greatly.
1	The terrain setting effect the cyclist in many ways. The fast that he was in a desert made him thirsty. There was no towns any sign of water to quench his thirst. The hills he would dtwepend than heartycle town just  made him moretired. These what the setting did to the cyclist.
1	In the story “Do not exceed posted speed” by @PERSON1, the cyclist faces problems caused by the setting. The biker was riding and the heat was scourching and the biker was really getting dehydrated and tired and he was running out of water. Because it was so hot the biker had to drink more water to replenish his body of all the sweat he was loosing while biking. The hills of the terrain were making it harder on the biker by making him us more energy and liquid to keep going. If it had been cool and breezy he would have had no problem making that distance. If the surrounding area was full of people and not abandoned towns than he would have had water to drink.
8	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3, I strongly sudjest that people should spend more time away from the computer. Instead they should be doing more exercise, doing more outdoor activity's, and most importantly spending more time with family and friend's. I think the best way to get everyone to agree with me is to write a passage to explain why I think that people should spend more time away from the computer. The most important reason why people should stop wasteing time on the computer is so that they could get more exercise. Getting more exercise could help you out in a big way because the less exercise you get means the less healthier you are. More exercise could also be helpful because you could have health preventing you from getting deabetes, and a lot of people get diabetes from body in shape. My last reason why I say that getting more exercise is good for you is because, if you get more exercise then you would not have to worry about all of the deseas and problem's when you are in your elder ages. Another way you could spend your time instead of staying on the computer is by doing outdor activity's. Outdoor activitys could be really good for you because if you are not used to going outside and playing a nice game of football with you friends than it would be very fun for you. I remember one time when I first started going outside I had so much fun. My last reason why I say that more people should spend time doing more outdoor activitys is because of nature. It would be really good for you to go on a walk in a nice @DATE1 day to feel the breeze and smell all the nice scents. My last reason why I say that you should spend more time off of the computer is so that you could spend more time with your family. Spending time with family is way more important then going on the computer with friends. I remember one time when my cousin and I were at his house and we really did not know each other but I got to spend more time with him and now we know a lot about each other. My last reason why I say that you should spend more time with your family is because you could learn a lot about you family. So now you know the three reason's why I say you could be doing more thing's instead of spending time on the computer which are exerciseing, doing outside activity's, and spending time with your family.
3	Every body experiences physical and emotional pain, but most probably wouldn't have survived what the cyclist in this story went through. The man started a bike ride Yosemite National park, but when some eldrerly men told him a short cut, his adventure had just because. First at all, every &quot;town&quot;and &quot;building&quot; the men told him he would come to, would come to, wound up being completely desserted. At first this wasn't a big deal to the cyclist. In the fourth paragraph when he came to his first desserted town he, &quot;chuckled, checked [his] water town supply, and moved.&quot; @CAPS1, as his journey progressed, his water decreased.He was then in desperation for a town.On topof thatin the story he wrote, ''the tast roadwas replaced short, rolling hills. &quot;This made his biking harder and he was then becoming denyarated. He finally found a town with water, but learned his lesson from taking advice from strangers and old men. 
3	The features of the setting would have affected the cyclist a lot. There is a man who takes the advice of old men and takes a “shortcut” to Yosemite Park. The shortcut only leads him to thirst, and no park. The narration states, “A sandblasted picture of a young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice into his mouth couldstill be seen (Kurmaskie @NUM1). &quot;This feature could affect the cyclist by discouraging him. the cyclist comes to the first “town” but only finds yet again no water, and a picture of something that makes him more thirsty. It could also make him be more angry at the old men because they led him on this pointless journey. Another feature that @MONTH1 affect the cyclist is the lack of trees or shade. The only thing he could feel was the sun beating down on his back. The narration states, “Wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt.(Kurmaskie @NUM1).” This also makes the cyclist believe that old men do not know what they are talking about.
1	There are many features of the setting that affected the cyclist in &quot;Do not exceed the posted speed limit,&quot; The time of year affected the cyclist because it’s mid June, @CAPS1 the region affected the cyclist because mid June in arizona is extremely hot and try. If it was in a more northern state in @DATE1 or I, ll it wouldn’t be as bad and you world not have the dance of a heat struggles. @CAPS1 when the terrain changed from flat to hills this affected him because it made it harder for him the to ride. These are some features of the settings that affected the cyclist in &quot;Do not exceed the posted speed limit.&quot;
2	In  rough raod ahead by Joe Kurmaskie the feature of the setting affected the cyclist. Because he was in the desert of California in June, he water supply was emicated and he came across a ghost town. His hope was dwindling because of this. He found a water pump that produced a tar like substance as a result the desert and the lack of water made him wish he was dead he decided never to take advice from strangers and to trust his map. That is how the feature affected the setting.
3	In the essay, “Rough Road A head Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” the features of the setting affected the cyclist. First of all, he was traveling in the @CAPS1 which means it was very dry. This meant that the cyclist could not refill his water and was slowly getting dehydrated. Also, the cyclist was biking in the heat. This meant that he was continuesly sweating which also depleted his water from his body and played tricks on his mind. Finally the hills caused him to exact more energy furthermore making him more and more dehydrated. The hills also put a damper on his spirits, which made him have to muster a lot of inner strength and determination to keep going. This part of the setting affected him emotionally. Overall the setting had a physical and emotion effect on him.
3	The cyclist is alone traveling on a flat land at first following the direction in which the old men told him to get to Yosemite National Park in @LOCATION1. During his travels he becomes dehydrated cycling over hills and deserts with othe sun beating down on him in such hot weather of June, he realizes he could get a heart stroke without water. His travels are desolate and lonely and when he finally sees building which are realy ghost towns he recovers and finds some determination to speed up. The cyclist luckily found a camp site to save him from passing out in a desert where he could rest, get water, then carry on his journey using his own map.
1	In the story “Do not exceed posted speed Limit”, the cyclist is trying to get to Yosemite with directions that some codgers, or eccentric old men, gave him. The cyclist, said the old men looked as though they, “haven’t left the confines of their poaches since carter was in office. “  Well, he takes their advice, and he gets lost about @NUM1 along on his journey. While looking forward to the “Cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite”’ he was traveling through a barren desert. “There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind.” This type of setting could really bring down a cultist’s mood while thinking of Yosemite. It could make him lose all hope of ever finding Yosemite at this rate. If you have a nice setting, it makes the trip worthwhile, and your ending point even better.
3	The setting effected the performence of the cyclist and the mood of the cyclist. The rolling hills the cyclist had to get over most likely made him more fined and thirsty because he had to put more effort in to get over them. “over one long, crippiling hill, a building came into view.” The long, big hills that he had to go up and made him more thirsty, but probably more satisfied when it was all over. Ironically, the building was a grape juice factory; abandoned and rusty, but the sigh featuring a boy drinking a refreshing glass of juice was still noticeable. This brought his hopes down. But continued to move on. In my life, I have never had such an experience to where I had to keep pushing and urging myself to my goal, but the closes I got, the more distractions got in the way to and stop me.
3	“Do not exceed posted speed limit”, is a short story about a man who is bicycling through Yosemite and he asks some elderly men for direction and they lead him in this “old” shortcut that takes him through tough terrain and extreme famine. The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways throughout the story for example when the bicyclist came to a deserted area he said “there was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind”. By this time he was malnourished &amp; in need of water this extreme thrist also reselted in him passing an abandoned Welch’s grape juice factory with an advertisement with a young boy pouring a fresh glass of juice in his mouth. He says “In an ironic twist that should please all sadists reading this, the building,”, then he goes into detail about the building, this mood &amp; feeling by this time was tired and worn out and the advertisement didn’t help the situation at all. The authors mood did change with the setting and before it got better it was worse.
3	The young cycolist began his day confident in looking forward to his day of riding across california, slowly, however as he recognizes his been directed wrongly, his mood changes,&amp; he begins to feel more hopless. AS he begins, he feels carefree &amp; mody for anything. He writes &quot;I checked, checked my water supply &amp; moved on. The sun was beginning to heat down, not I barely noticed it. The surroundings have little effect on him. Later, on he realizes his water was going down, &amp; he is getting tired, his mood changed to exhaustion &amp; defect. Here he writes “i got back on the bike, but not before I gathered up a few pebbles &amp; stuch them in my mouth with any luck I’d hit a bump of lodge one in my throat.” He has become sarcastic of saddened by the hoplessness of his journey. Eventually, he had relief of the cold water helps to bring up his spirits &amp; sense of humor
10	Dear @ORGANIZATION1 newspaper, I firmly believe that computers do have a positive benefits on society. These advancements in technology can only enrich peoples lives. One way computer help is that students can do their school work online and see their teachers pages. Another great thing about computers is that whenever people need information or details on any place or things have can count on the internet to help them out. Most importantly they are a vital source of communication. People depend on computers for their scheduling and keeping in touch with everyone that they know. Without computers students would have it a lot worse. When a student forgets the homework, they can just go on their teachers online page and check what he assignment was for that night. Another thing that students benefit from are online textbooks. If a student can't manage to carry home @NUM1 pounds of books they can just use their textbook online. Nowadays, the internet is filled with lots of great information and educational site. Teacher also can allow students to research for projects online and participate in online educational activities. Not only do computer help out educationally' they are probably the must well known information centers. If people want to see about a restaurant, store or product, they can do that online. Also, many people want to go to destinations but do not know how to get there. The internet provides them with directions for them on how to reach their destination in a quick and efficient manner. An extremely important and helpful aspect of the internet is the ability of purchasing and ordering items online. Before someone decides to but something, they can find out all sorts of information about the product and shop around for the lowest price. People can even order groceries to new house if they are busy! I strongly think that the internet is the number one way of communication between people. For example, the team manager of my soccer team always emails me times and locations of the next game or practice. I would be lost and confused without these emails what I depend on. Buisnesses also heavily rely on the internet to keep in touch with their clients that keep them in buisness. The use of web confrences saves a lot of travel and it allows the company to be in buisness with all over the world. Above all, people depend heavily on social networking sites to keep intouch with friends, keep up to date on the news, and have fun talking to people. Without the internet, probably half of the world communications would be down and that would not be good. Computers, without do have positive effect on society. When it can be an educational resource it is very helpful. Also, it is the best information database known to and is probably the most used. Most importantly, wihout computer the world would be a mess without their main source of communications People know not to spend too much time inside and he always know when to go outside have some fun and get some fresh air. Therefore, computers have no negative effect on people and they remain an essential asset in everyday life.
2	In the essay the features of the setting affected the cyclist. In the begginning the setting was at the old man’s place and the cyclist was happy and confident. When he reached the ghost town and was out of water he was upset and frustrated. When he saw the building he was relived but when he found out it was abandoned he was sad. When he finally reached the store he was excited and relived. That is how the setting affected the cyclist during his trip
2	Weather, places, the will to continue – all are reason that explain how the features of the setting affected the cyclist. First the weather will affect the cyclist because in hot weather you lose a lot of water and you sweat a lot making it hard to pedal. The sunny hot weather will affect his will to ride.  I mean come on who wants to ride when its burning hot outside the places the cyclist went through like towns and rough roads would affect him because it’s pretty tough.
2	The story “Rough road ahead: do not exceed posted, speed limit “ tells of a biking trip gone wrong. But the story would  not be as terrifying if it had happend in a different place. The setting plays a large role in the story. The story begins on a present summer evening but as the man bikes he arrives at ghost town devold of evil life, later feeling of double sets In when he arrives at “one ramshockle shed, severall rusty pumps and a corrol that couldn’t hold these lamest mule. ” later we fear panic set in as these terrain becomes hilly and tumbleweeds and snakes cross the path. Like an cold wesstern. Finally all  hope is lost when he reaches these grapes Juice factory and fInd, “a sand blasted picture of a Young boy, ” The setting is a power full tool which greatly influences the cyclist.  
3	In the story, “Rough Road Ahead: Do not exceed posted speed limit,&quot; by Joe Kurmaskie, the features of the setting affected they cyclists physical abilities. The features affected is abilities, because the climate and dangerous environment was hot and rough to handle. These features were hot and rough 'Since he was in the California deserts in June. The passage that supports this is,”. Tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake- it really did look like a diamondback- blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me. I eased past, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state. Also, the features of the setting give him determination. They give him determination, because each horizon he sees gives him hope. They give him hope since he knows he is that much @NUM1 to Yosemite National Park. The passage that supports this is when he drops,&quot;.distances I could see on the horizon, telling myself that @CAPS1 could move it that far, I’d be fine.” In the story,&quot; Rough road ahead, Do not exceed posted speed limit, by Joe Kurmaskie, the features of his settings affect both they cyclists physical and mental abilities
3	The features of the setting have a huge effect on the cyclist. There was a point in the story where he ran out of water ad he remembered that the old guys had sworn the next town was only eighteen miles down the rode. He was tired ad dehydrated but he thought he could make it along the road. So he started off and the two miles later the terrain changed and so did his outlook on this entire journey. “Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills. &quot;Sometimes life can be so cruel.” @CAPS1 hills took a lot out of him and he was now on a highway. Before this terrain change the rider is very positive and thinks he can do this easily. “I could make that!” But after the terrain change he looses hope and almost don’t make it. “It didn’t really matter. I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean.” It is obvious as you read that when the terrain becomes tough it has a huge negative effect on the cycilists.
1	The features of the setting effect the cyclist in a few ways. The roads were nice and smooth then turned to hills. It was a hot day in June and he had a sparse water supply with him. He was peddling through the desert’s of California. The last thing that effected him was that there wasn’t very many places to stop for water.
2	In the essay “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” by Joe Kurmaskie, a cyclist is on his way trying to find his way to Yosemite National Park, but runs into a little trouble when getting directions from a couple of older men. The one lesson the cyclist learned was to never to listen to short-cuts given to you by old men who are extremly out of date and haven’t left their pourch since Carter was in office. The cyclist learned this the hard way when he ends up lost and almost died of thirst. The setting takes place in the desert of California or in deserted ghost towns. One his journey the cyclist says “…I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June.” This feature effects the cyclist because of the extremely dry heat beating down on him makes him dehydrated. Also along his journey the cyclist encounters hills. The feature of the setting effects the cyclist by tiring him out and making him believe there isn’t any hope of him getting out alive. Features of the setting like hills and deserts dehydrates a
2	The features of the setting affect the cyclist. It seems to be the more despirate the situation the more determand her becomes. Pg @NUM1 (I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean). Right after he thinks this he climbed away for the abandoned factory of Juices and dreams. He says pg @NUM1 come troubles, thirst and tean where all behind me, this shows that after a situation the bilaver tells realeoved of all earthley obligations. Not only does the settings affect the cyclist but the entire story around him.
2	The setting of the story, are very dry and humid, and flat, and hilly. The author noticed the terrain changing, “Flat road. Was replaced by short, rolling hills” (Joe kurmaskie). Being out in the middle of a dessert like surronding during June, and nothing surronding him is a scary thought. The heat, and lack of water affect him, by him possibly getting mirages, or he @MONTH1 faint, because of the heat, and how much fluid he has lost. The hills don’t help any eigther.
1	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because he is riding through the desert in the middle of June yet he has very little water. This affects him because he is thirsty but he doesn’t have a lot of water to drink and he is in a desert in the middle of June which makes it very hot. Also in the story it says he comes to Welch’s Grape Juice Factory were on the side of the building he see picture of a “young boy pouring a refreshing a loss of juice into his mouth” This make the cyclist even thirstier but he continues one to find water at a bait shop.
10	Dear Newspaper, In @DATE1's world we are dependent on computers. @DATE1 computers have become the most helpful source of technology. We need computers for so many things, and they benefit society. They can help people talk online, they're educational, and they improve hand eye cordination. It has been amazing how computers help us so much. We need computers like we need water. If we didn't how would we survive? Computers have become the glue to friendships. They help keep friendships when you don't see the friend constantly. I have a friend that moved to @LOCATION1 last year. It was way too expensive to just call ot text her. So as a result, I keep in contact with her through the computer. Everyday we @CAPS1 and use skype to keep intouch. Those cost @MONEY1 per year. If I were to call her each call would cost @MONEY2. if it weren't for the internet I seriously know that our friendship would collapse. Computers have been so helpful for many people with this same problem. Computers have become the number one source to find information. They have become more popular than the library and text books combined. So many essential resources are on computers. Text books, calculators, and even homework are online. Many people say that computers aren't educational, but scientists say it can move a students grade from a @CAPS2- to an A+. Teachers say the same thing too. one of my fellow students said that computers changed his life. He used to be forgetting to write down his homework, but he looks online and he has all of it. Now he knows what pages to read from the science book. If you don't think that computers have changed students lives, well think again. There are also games that improves hand eye cordination. Many sports teams like the @CAPS3 use this. It has increased there hand eye cordination by @PERCENT1. the team says if it wasn't for the hand eye cordination game, then they would have never have won the @CAPS4 @CAPS5. this game is also free online for anyone to use. Everyone that has used it said it really improved there reaction time. The games are also fun and non violent. They have games like baseball, hockey, and hurdles. This game has made a great improvement on people's lives. If we don't have computers then our hand eye cordination will decrease by @PERCENT2. would you want to be the person to take away computers? In conclusions computers have made a great impact on @DATE1's society. Computers are educational, you get to talk to friends, and improve your hand eye cordination. Computers have made a big improvement on how we live, and it's for the better. If we didn't have computers then friendships would break, grades would decrease, and hand eye cordination would plummit. We need computers they have been so beneficial to billions of people across the globe. Many people depend on computers. So if we take away computers then you'll be letting many lives down. No sane person would want to take away computers. Computers have benifited society in so many ways. 
8	Dear Readers, I understand some people are concerned that people spend too much time on the computer and that it is bad. I disagree, computers can help keep family members that live far away in touch. You can also see pictures of things that you cant see everyday. Finally, it helps your school work. I know a family that has a son fighting in the @LOCATION1. He brought his laptop with him so he was ask to video chat with his family. It seemed as though he never left. Without it, his family would wonder how he was and be worried. You don't have to have a family member at war to talk to them on the computer. Have you ever wanted to see what @LOCATION2 looks like? You don't have to travel there to find out. All you have to do is search it on your computer! If you live in a city with not a lot of nature in it, you can see what its like outside it with the computer. Seeing those sights @MONTH1 make you to travel, travelling with your family brings you closer. A study shows @PERCENT1 of families that go on vacations have strong relationships. Having a computer is mandatory for school. It is the best thing to research with. @PERCENT2 of students that are failing don't use a computer for homework. There are also websites that you can use for studying. There is a student in my school that failed most of his classes. He never used a computer. His friend suggested using one at home if he was having trouble, which he tries. He used a computer to help study for a test he had the next day. He ended up getting a @PERCENT1 on the test because he used a computer. It doesn't matter you using a computer for homework, talking with friends and familym or it is one of the most important inventions ever made.
3	The cyclist in this essay is trying to go to Yosemite National Park. He feels confident in him making it, not realizing what is up ahead. First comes the windy roads. As he goes along his confidence starts to wither away. The desert hits him like a boulder because he is running short on water and needs to rest. The extreme heat just makes everything worse. “Not the miley into this heat section of the ride, I noticed the terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills. “This shows that the cyclist did not expect to meet this kind of terrain and is over whollmed by it. The one thing he never does is give up. This is important because as he went along, just before hagon up, he found a place to get water and to relax. “Then, as easily as running about, my troubles thirst, and nor were all behind me” This shows that he was strong and determined to survive and he finally found what he needed and it made happy and have a will to live. Everyone in life needs to be determined.
0	It give him a hard time so he learn a lot of thing from that he know that it not always easy. It not abig problem but sometime some small problem become bigger life is like riding bike you have any down some time have problem sometimes lost but that is life.
3	The features of the setting very much affect the cyclist. He had to ride through tough conditions and became very exhausted. I believe the toughest feature of the setting was the heat. He told us, “I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June.”  He was talking about how he needed to sip from his water more than normally. Another tough feature of the setting was the hills he had to ride up and down. As he was riding he said, “Flat road was replace by short, rolling hills.” I believe riding over these hills in the hot @DATE1 in a California desert was a very tough task for the cyclist. I believe the terrain very much affected him.
2	The features of the setting in this story make the ride more difficult for the cyclist. For example, the cyclist is moving through the “… high   deserts of California… “   (kurmaskie @NUM1). This shows that the cyclist is at a high altitude, which makes breathing more difficult. Then the cyclist notes that the “Flat road was replaced by short rolling hills “   (Kurmaskie @NUM1   ). The hills would make the trip more difficult. This is evidenced by the cyclist describing one   of them as a   “… long, crippling hill… “ (Kurmaskie @NUM1 ). Clearly, the terrain, which got   increasingly difficult, negatively affected the cyclist.
2	In the story, the setting affected the cyclist in many ways. For example, the condition of the road was bad. It changed from flat road to short, rolling roads. Tumble weeds crossed his path. He had lack of water, and the water he did have tasted like battery acid. In the story it says, “I eased past, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state.”  
1	The features of the setting affect the cyclist like if you have to goup hill or along long bumpy type roads. Then in the essay it says “Rough road ahead: do not exceed posted speed limit: @CAPS1 does make things more difficult than average. Especially with a lack of water to make things worse.
2	The setting greatly affects the cyclist trying to get to Yosemite National Park. First of all, the cyclist says he’s in Lodi, California on a “gorgeous day in June.” It’s very hot in California in June, so the biker is affected by the weather because he could die of heatstroke. Also, he is in the middle of the desert , where he faces tumbleweeds crossing his path a large snake that are possible poisonous in the way. That puts him in more despair, because he could get hurt by a wild animal, or run out of water with no place to go get more ! So the setting mostly negatively affects the cyclist.
2	The features of the setting affected the cyclist; the author says he is in the California desert. This means that the cyclist must conserve water so he can stay hydrated for the trip. Also, there are many hills, as the author says, “over one crippling hills…” with a lot of hills to climb, the cyclist uses up more energy and will become dehydrated quickly, if he isn’t careful. Finally, there are many abandoned towns that are several miles apart from each other. This again affects how the cyclists uses his water, he thinks that there is a prospering town coming up, so he drinks his water, thinking he’ll get more soon. However, when he gets there, there is no water, and he must pedal seveal more miles to the next town with very little water. The setting is a great effect on how the cyclists act especially with no water.
3	The features of the setting in “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” greatly affect the cyclist. Depending on what sort of new terrain or landmark he came to,his determination increases and decreases. For example, when he saw a building come into view ahead of him, he got excited and used all his energy to get down the hill to the building. Also, when he came to the next building and found a working bathroom, he drank from the sink as his hope (of not dying) was renewed. The man riding the bike in the story had many different changes in his emotions during his long trek in this story that were dependent on the setting. 
9	Computers are very important, I don’t know anyone who does not need one. But some people say that it distracts you from exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friend. Do I agree? No I disagree with this situation because computers are a modern day tech that people use. They say it distracts you from interacting with family and friends but a computer is the number one way to talk to long distance friends and family, @CAPS1 without a computer how will those people who work for a business work, and last we always need a computer for research. A computer grabs attention to a lot of teenager. Most of the sites we use due to interacting with family and friends. The two main sites people use is myspace and facebook everyone must know these two sites nine out of ten people use it to interact just think if we did not have a computer we would not be able to interact with our long distance friends and family. My aunt has a facebook and her friends live in @CAPS2 she interacts with them all the time they @CAPS1 have phones but comp. have webcames so you can see the person too. Business people need computer a lot of course mobile computers thats why they have laptops. But as I was saying what will people do with out a computer for work they have your schedules, your notification your boss sent out and much more on the weeks most people work and the weekends we can go visit our family membere there are mosly days in a week and a job pay of course you need a computer. Google is the number one searching website we have. If you want to know what time a movie starts most likely you will go to search on the computer, if you have a research paper due of course you will use the computer. We need the computer for everything if I were to ask my dad what the square root of pie is he would tell me google it. This is one of the main thin people do when they us a computer to research. So if you! Yeah I said you think a comp. is a waist of breath think again because it helps you to communicate with your friends. A lot of business people need it to work and last it is a good research engine. But here is a little advice dont spend all!! Day on the computer pick up your walking shoes to get some fresh air you have all day on the computer just go out and enjoy your self in any way possible.
10	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, @CAPS3 computers hold exclusive inofrmation, I do not believe the have a good effect on people. The majority of students today crowd around a computer while they can be taking care of their body. Such as excersising or just going outside. People need to enjoy the wonders of nature instead of sitting on a computer. Not only will computers impact people, but it @MONTH1 also impact family in friends. There will be less interacting time a risk by going on a computer. Different websites can expose the wrong thing and get you into trouble. I firmly believe that computers have hamble affects on people. In @LOCATION1 today, we are already loaded with obese poeple. @NUM1 outof @NUM2 people are not physically healthy and a majority of obese people today state that they do own a computer. Computers attract people and same @MONTH1 sit at the computer for hours at a time what about excersising or enjoying the outdoors? Computers damage our bodies in a way by luering ourselves in while we can go out and enjoy nature. I definatly will argue this fact that computers have a bad effect on humans. Computer change not only the body, but mind. My sister has a computer in her bedroom and I barely see her at all. She stays up there all the time, and when my mom calls for dinner, it takes more than five @CAPS2 to get her away from her computer. Computers affect people because they keep humans away from civilization. Friends and family are impacted by the lack of interaction from one person. It's disrespectful to take time away from your friends to play on computers. This ruins many peoples social health, because the more they ignore their family or friends, these people will stop trying to interact with them. When these computer finatics came around, there want be anyone there for them. Computers definatly have an unhealthy affect on people who use them. How would you feel if tons of your personal info got out into the public. Nowadays, computers have a major chance to do that to you. Websites like @CAPS4, mysapce, or twitter have your information, and with a click of a button, it can be exposed to the world. Computers have a background of doing this kind of effect on people. Some dont understand what they are doing and if bad info or a picture sends out, it can fully negatively impact your career or edecation. Computers help people to make wrong choices and there is no doubt people should let up on the time they spend on the internet. Many agree, computers disadvantage many people in their own way. Whether it is by taking their health away because it keeps many indoors, or if it costs you your friends and family, computers are not good for your physical and social health. Computers can send out information and they are risky. They will majority impact your future and impact all people in a bad way.
8	The effects of computers to people are that adults and kids are getting way more attention then they need to. The first reason why is that most spend their time social networking. The others are either buying things or playing games. Some of the people that are on the computers are wasting too much time being tech-saavy. It's other ways people can spend their time like biking or taking a brisk walk. Another solution is you can get up on you learning skills or find a job around you town. Computers drain and waste peoples minds everyday. I think it is essential for the people that can't get off seek fitness and mental health. Than again it could be legitimate reasons to be on the computers spending as much time as you want. The people that abuse the access of their computer too much should think and find something else to do. I think it'll be a good idea to have a time when the computers should be shut off one day or a week. By that I mean the cable/enternet company should turn the internet and the cable off for a week of pure exercise. That'll make people who are lazy to do something active. It'll also be a good motivator for people who are on the computer or watching t.v too much. Then it would make everybody fit and health if they try. I understand the elderly or senior citizens who need their computers for health help. That's understandable but everyone else should not be exempt. Computers and laptops should be network disconnected to make people get off their feet and do something helpful or brain building. Everyday people are being digitally sucked in. Some people in this world just can't get enough of it and it need to dead soon. The government should make a legal law that you must do something that will actively benefit you. It should be a person of the state or local towns person that goes to every house. Another way that could be done is by one person from every street in the state go home-to-home to make sure the procedure is being done. A lot of people are not going to like it and they will not obey the new law. It should be a penalty towards anyone that fails to abide by it. The second choice should be a loss of internet services. That'll make them really mad and in exchange they should still exercise. Sometimes it takes harsh laws to make somebody change.
8	Did you know that computers are the number @NUM1 selling electronic device in the world? I think that computers are only making our soceity a smarter and more inteligent place. Also computers help old time friends and family keep in touch. Finnaly I think they are helping are society because computers teach great hand-eye coordination. Studies have shown that @PERCENT1 of the people growing up with computers at home have a high paying job! Computers are very intelligent pieces of equipment and if you know how to use a computer you will most likley hae a high paying carreer. Also mostly every job from doctor to police officer to casheer at a store all involve computers and to go those jobs you must know how to work a computer. This is only one of the many reasons I think computers will benifit our soceity. Secondly, I think that this price of technology benifits soceity because it keep family, friends and workers in touch. Have you ever had a time where you think back and wish you could see your old high school friends or even family living. Far away, @CAPS1 computers are one of the most popular ways to do so with all the new websites like @CAPS2, twitter or even your old email website people are keeping in touch all over the world. Another way computers help old time friends keep touch with the new video camera in the computer, family, friends and workers can actually see each other from different parts of the world. A simple message though one of these websites will make someones day and could even make yours. Finnaly I think that computers benifit our soceity because they teach hand eye coordination other life skills. How do you think people can shoot a gun so and so quickly or how do you think a baseball player can swing at such a perfect time. All these things revolve around hand-eye coordination which is best learned by computers. Also people can save lives by just a type about a hurricane, tornado anything but if they do not know how to work a computer many people can get injured or die. These are only three of the many reasons I think computers benifit our soceity. So think twice about the negative comments people say about computers.
7	Dear @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1 that use computers is a good thing. I state this because the web has many things to do. For example, facebook, twitter, and myspace are all social sites. Also there are video sites such as youtube. Plus @CAPS1 learn how to type fast. Social network sites are good for @CAPS1. Teens got to talk to each other, make new friends, and post what they want. For example, twitter you can post tweets, facebook you can join groups, and become a fan of something or someone, and myspace you can send messages. TEENS relieve a lot of stress on the web. Videos are great when your bored. Type in youtube and get a good laugh or two. Teens that go on youtube become more social. For example, teens can learn the new dance. Plus on video sites there are comedy. Comedy helps daily life. @CAPS2 helps life if you work in a office or a trademark. Teens learn to type to make life easier. For example @CAPS2 fast is like texting. @CAPS2 is like writing a letter electronically. So get to @CAPS2. Ok so computers do help life in teen years. Basically it is @CAPS3 somewhat. All people should have a computer. Just remember that social sites, video sites, and @CAPS2 make life better.
7	Yes, I do think that we should continue useing computers because it helps us stay in contact with other countries around the world, it forms a balance, and it also makes life simpler. First of all, computers help us stay in contact with the other countries around the world. Without computers we would not be able to @CAPS1 or evan video message other countries about important events. Sencond, we have to balance computers and excersing and interacting with just sitting on the computer but computers can help us interact with family and friends by emailing or video chating can also help you stay in contact. Last useing computers makes life simpler like how its so much easier to write an @CAPS1 and not a letter and its easier to instant message someone then to call them also for school projects you can make your project look so much better by adding pictures and diffrent fonts just hand writing it. That why arents arent a waste at time because they help us stay in contact with the other countres, they form a balance and it also makes life simplier.
10	Dear @LOCATION1, Computers are a neccessity to life. They benefit not only the community but the whole world! They provide education for anyone who has access to the internet. Secondly, it's a form of communication. Also, computers can be fun and entertaining. As you know, education is one of the most important things in anyone's life. Where would we be without a computer to help? Think about how many times you've used @ORGANIZATION2 or @CAPS1 to search something you didn't know the answer to. It's a lot, right? I do research everytime I get a random question jammed in my head. Imagine how tough it would be without a computer to rely on when you have no idea how to answer something. Another thing is there are online courses now for students. Some college students have to look up their assignments and how to do them on their professors web page. Also, how world students know what their homework is if they can't check the @PERSON1 homepage? I check it almost everyday when I come home from school. It's great that the teachers care enough to post the homework. Without computers, we'd have a higher percentage of students not doing their homework. @NUM1 out of every @NUM2 people in @LOCATION2 has some form of online communication program. Whether it's @ORGANIZATION3 @CAPS2 or @CAPS3, maybe even youtube, or just a simple e-mail, practically everyone has one. How else are yousupposed to talk to your friends after school? What do you expect us to do call them? Then wwwe would be on the phone for hours! Anybody with a teen at home knows that. Also, computers help deaf people talk. They just type in what they want to say and out it comes.I remember when a lady came to our school who was blind and deaf and she demonstrated how to use that special program. Another reason is teachers and parents use e-mail to talk about academics and their children. Clearly communication is a must have. Therefore, computers are a benefit to society. There is no way that anybody over the age of @NUM3 has never played a computer game sometime in their life. Except, of course, if they don't have internet access. I know I used to play computer games, but they started to slow down my computer so my dad told me I had to stop or I can't use the computer anymore. Woops! Still, you can use the computer to look up cheats on video games. Oh come on like you haven't done that! Or at least your children have. Also, you can use specific programs like @ORGANIZATION1 @CAPS4 or @CAPS5 @CAPS6 to create a cover page for a project or a presentation for your corporal business. In other words, computers are pleasurable. As you can see, computers are extremely educational. They provide search engines to figure out anything you're ever wanted to know about. Like, foreign places or movies. Anything. Also, we wouldn't have as much communication with people. How would we e-mail friends in @LOCATION3 without computers? Finally, you can find pleasure in computers. They are beneficial.
9	Dear Local Newspaper, I don't know if I am understanding correctly but are you honestly thinking about not advancing technology? Quickly rethink that because that @MONTH1 just be the worst mistake you could ever make computers can tech hand-ey coordination, they can also give you very useful knowledge. Lastly, computers help us stay close to our family and friends. Fisrt off, about @PERCENT1 of people say that they use the computer every day so that they can increase their knowledge. This could ba as simple as going on @ORGANIZATION1! and discovering the latest news. This is ten times easier that going on the @CAPS1 and waiting for the news stone you want details on. I took a survey and @NUM1 students say that they use thier computer every night so that they can read more into thier social studies or science unit, @CAPS2 computer advances away is like @CAPS2 learning advances away, now is that what you want? Second, @PERSON1, chrildrens doctor states, &quot;Computers give children that hand-eye coordination they need to enhance in sports&quot; I agree! Sports such as baseball, soccser, and basketball all need a great deal of hand-eye coordination. Without the hand-eye coordination, students will not do well and end up quiting. I know that if I was having trouble with sports for a long time, I would give up! If the teens gave up sports then they would't have anyining to keep them fit one! that would lead to hundred of kids with on obesity problem. Lastly, @CAPS2 away the advancing in computers maens that you are @CAPS2 away family and friends connectionds. Computers offer many sites such as facebook or myspace o connect with loved ones. You can also go on @CAPS3 or sype to chat or video chat with them. Yes, maybe computers are @CAPS2 away time with family but what about @CAPS4 or @CAPS5 in @LOCATION1 that you have at to in over a year? Don't you want some time them too? You can make time limts for yourself so that you don't spend your whole time on the computer. This way you can took to all of your loved ones would you want to be the one crushing the oceans of a child that wants to talk/ see his grandparents? In conclusion, I remember talking and laughing with my friends over the computer when @CAPS6 sick so that @CAPS7 could cheer me up. Dont take that away from me! Keep enhancing computers so that I can advance my knowledge, increase my hand-eye coordination and get to see my far friends and family.
8	Dear local newspaper, Too much technology! Computers have a negative effect on people. First, our country needs to exercise more, and not just sit around, second, we aren't spending enough time caring for our environment. And third, we are losing the ability to communicate with the people around us. Our country has problems with being overweight. Most people blame it on fast food, but it's also because people sit around using computers, and dont think about staying in proper shape. Before computers were made, people were much more fit, and healthy, we need to help our country get back in shape, and take our attention away from the computer, for even just a short while, and we need to exercise! The next reason is that computers don't just have a bay effect on people, but our enveironment too. We spend too much time indoors with technology, and we don't even care about the world around us. Before much technology, people used to plant gardens, and trees, but now that thought hardly crosses our minds. All the electronics these days are making people forget about nature, and that needs to change. The last reason computers have a negative effect is that people dont communicate as well anymore with the people around them. If we communicate so much with people through technology, we are losing the ability to speak and communicate in person, and it ruins relationships and connections between people, like family and friends, so we need to start caring about the people around us, and not always rely on technology. In conclusion, you can see the negative effect computers have on people. We need to excercise more. Also, we need to help our environment. And lastly, we need to communcate better with friends and family. We shouldn't get rid of computers, but just step away and care about the world around you.
10	Dear Local Newspaper, @CAPS1 opinion for using &quot;too much&quot; computer time is an outrage. I think people should have more ideas. Such as as exercise, socialize with family and friends, and lastly, &quot;you time&quot; which means to do whatever you would like to do indoors BUT @CAPS2 computers. For excersice you can do any sport that you like outside. For @CAPS3 and spending time with family and friends you can have a nice family reunion at their house @CAPS5 just &quot;hangout with your friends. Four &quot;you time you can draw, @CAPS5 read a book. Their is a lot of ideas instead of &quot;computer time @CAPS6 the time!&quot; With exercising can go outside and play sport such as basketball, soccer @CAPS5 baseball, etc. You could even play hide and seek with your friends @CAPS5 even tag. Anything that keeps you moving out of the house ins tead of using computers! If you exercise everyday such as &quot;workout&quot; to get fit you will definatelly manage that instead of using &quot;computer time&quot;. Exercising is a good idea ins tead of using &quot;computer time!&quot; @CAPS3 with family and friends is a good use instead of &quot;computer time because you can finally have the time to spend time with then like talk to them, play games @CAPS5 eat dinner together. That's called &quot;@CAPS3&quot; Your family @CAPS5 friends will love to spend time together by eating dinner together and have a nice conversation. You could also play any board games such as &quot;monopoly&quot; too. With your friends you ran go to the movies, have a sleepover @CAPS5 play outside. Many good little ideas to do with family and friends instead of using &quot;computer time.&quot; The last idea for ins tead of using &quot;computer time&quot; lis doing &quot;you time indoors. WARNING! But @CAPS2 computer time! You could do something quite like draw a nice picture. That's something nice and quite to do instead of using &quot;computer time.&quot; @CAPS5 you could even read a book too. Maybe you have to catch up on your nightly reading for language arts and you want start reading your goal book. If you choose to do &quot;you time, you will definately manage to undo that useless &quot;computer time!&quot; @CAPS6 of these &quot;ideas&quot; for not using the computer is very easy. It's not healthey to sit around the computer @CAPS6 day! Instead you can exercise. You could also socialize with family and friends. Lastly, do &quot;you time. but don't use a computer!!! If you want to achieve a goal you can mange that!!!
9	More and more people are using computers on a daily basis, but I do not agree that this benefits our society. People are spending too much time on computers and less time exercising and healthy. Also people using computers are spending less time with family and friends. As people use computers more they are spending less time excersising and staying healthy. Profesor @PERSON1 has done a study showing that people who are on the computer for more than @NUM1 hrs a day are overweight and do not excersise regularly. He goes on the state that if these habits continue throughout their lives they will become obeast and are more likely to die from a heart attack before age @NUM2. I have experienced changes in my communities health due to computers as well, last year I had a friend who weighed @NUM3 lbs and exercised regularly but when he got a computer that folowing year he stopped exercising and gamed over @NUM4 lbs he now is much slower and can not do more than push ups. I do not agree that computers are benefiting our society because as people use computers more they exercise less causing them to be unhealthy. Not only do computers less on unhealthy life style, it also causes spend less time with family and friends. Studies show that @PERCENT1 of children that their our computer spend less time with their family and more time on the computer. This @MONTH1 not seem like a thing at but this study also shows that @PERCENT2 children who spend less time with their familieis grow up to become lonely and kill themselves due to depresion. I remember when a new came to our school from he wasn't that kid and didn't many friends he was still doing just fun but when he came back the next year started and I found out he had at the end of he school and keep in touch with an of his friend and to his parents. So far that week of from the rest of the students and don't much. Then the we got back the @DATE1 he wasn't at school and for the rest of the week he didn't show up either and finaly on @DATE2 and teachers told us he ran away from and has still not been found. So people that use computers are spending less time with their family and friends which can cause them to become depressed and lonely. More and more people are using computers daily basis, but I do not agree that this is benefiting our society. People are spending to much in their computers and are spending less time excersising and staying healthy. Also people using computers are spending less time with their family and friends. I know that the more people using computers is not better for our society it is worse.
10	Dear @PERSON1 the editor of the @LOCATION1 citizen, @CAPS1 has been brought to my attention from some people around @LOCATION1 that computers and technology are bad for us. I have also heard that people believe in the tecnology. So, the reason why I'm writing today is about this issue is to put my beliefs out there. I believe that this new technology is effecting our daily exercising, playing outside to enjoy nature and interacting with friends and family. Now that are new technology with computers and such, people are distracted and do not want to exercise. This will effect our youth because we will be fat, unhealthy and sluggish all the time. @PERSON1 we don't want this to happen to our youth because we are the future and if this keeps up the state and country will suffer. Another reason is that its good to exercise and not be on the computer or watching @CAPS2 all the time is because @CAPS1 has been proven you have more energy and will feel happier most of the time. Computers do not do that for us at all. A poll even says that @PERCENT1 of people get headaches and feel tired after being on the computer. Exercise won't do that at all. Sence all of our new technology with @CAPS2 and other gagits people really don't go outside play around and enjoy nature anymore. I was asking my mother about this topic and she said, &quot;@CAPS4 these days just don't go outside anymore. I remember when I was your age and my mother would kick me outside at @NUM1 am and I wouldn't be back home until around @NUM2 pm.&quot; I believe that this should still happen. Maybe parents should still do this with their @CAPS4 and have them run around the neigborhood with other @CAPS4. If we did this more offtine maybe @CAPS4 and adults too. will just do this naturally and will not have to relie on computers or @CAPS5 for entertainment. Don't you think this is a good idea @PERSON1? My last topic is with computers and cellphone and how we really don't interact with friends and family anymore. Now a days Friends aim, video chat or text each other instead of going and doing something with them. This isn't really healthy for us because we might not know how to talk to people in real life. Also is someone aims or texts you, you really don't know how their tone is because you are not talking to them face to face. Lastly I know familys that get hurt by technology because that is all they do. They don't put down their get off their emails and they feel like they don't see each other. This is also not a health relationship with family members. @PERSON1 I really hope I have persuade to you that technology is only ok to use sometime and not very day. Remember technology is bad because we don't exerce, play outside and enjoy nature and really don't interact with friends and family members. Thank you for your time.
11	Dear I think computers greatly benefit society, and advance technology. They provide knowledge in a click, and entertainment after a long day out work or school. Not only that, but people have found long-lasting careers because of the invention of the computer. So obviously, computers are a great influence on society. Do you want to find out when major legue baseball first came to be? Or maybe you have a history report due the next day, and your parents can'@CAPS3 drive you to the library? This isn'@CAPS3 a problem anymore. Computers have evolved a long way since they were invented in the @NUM1's. You can check up on your local news, by having @NUM2's of electronic newspapers right at your fingertips. Or maybe you want to venture outside your neighborhood, and check out what's happening in @LOCATION2 or @LOCATION1. News isn'@CAPS3 the only thing the internet is useful for though. You can also go onto one of the @DATE1's of websites for school help, or check how the stock market is doing. Or, you can just use the handy calculator found right on your desktop. What could be better? Of course not all users have a computer for information. Many have it for entertainment purposes. In fact @PERCENT1 of people use the computer for entertainment everyday. What, with all the fun stuff you can do, who can blame them? Social networking is placed at the top of the list. A whopping @PERCENT2 of internet users use sites like @CAPS1 or @CAPS2. These sites are useful for catching up with friends you might not have seen in years or continue a conversation from @NUM3 minutes ago. You can also use computers to watch live-streaming @CAPS3.V, or that new @CAPS4 you got yesterday. That's right, @CAPS3.V's might not be needed soon! And what would a compter be without games? There are @NUM2's of @DATE1's of them scattered all across the web. How great is that? And finally, many people have found their careers through the internet. Did you know that @PERSON1, @NUM5, was found through you tube when his mom posted videos for the family to see when they couldn'@CAPS3 attend proformances? Of couse, you tube isn'@CAPS3 the only way to make money. Tons of jobs are listed by employers only for the curious person to find. No more wondering city streets, now you can just submit on aplication or have an interview without ever leaving your. Artists have also discovered talents, by playing around with @CAPS6 or @CAPS7. Not to mention the career paths involving computers directly, such as repairing or movie special effects. So no matter what you use a computer for have it be job hunting, entertainment, or information, they are a good idea to have them in your home. There's a erason that @PERCENT3 of @CAPS8 use them, and it's not just an excuse to sit around all stay.
7	Dear Local Newspaper, @CAPS1 of all I would like to say that I love your story and puzzels in your paper and I think I have a story you guys can use. It's about people that is addicted to computers. I guess you guys wondering about what I mean about addicition to computers. Well im going to give you three reason about this. My @CAPS1 reason is people isn't spending a lot of time with there family. I say this because most of the time couples get into arguments because the person thats addicted to the internet isn't doing want he/her is suppose to do. For example say you have a turkey in the oven and your so in the computer you forget all about it until the fire alarm goes off. Another reason why people can be addicted to the computer is because all the online chat rooms they have. I know people that's addicted to online chat rooms and I sometimes get worried about them because half of the time they don't know who there talking to! It could be anybody even a pedafile. My final reason is because some people just don't care. Some people can be on the computer all day and night doing nothing besides online chating when they can be doing a essay or something helpful or caring. You know I use to addicted to the computer myself and because of that I almost failed all my classes and because of that I don't use the computer to talk or anything such as that but now I just read my email or write my essay. And that concludes my or should I say your next top story.
10	Lies! The computers we use in society do not harm us in any way! They are a huge step forward for mankind and only benefit our lives. They benefit us greatly for the following reasons: computers are a source of knowledge, computers can aid the advertizment and buissness of many workplaces, and they are a very helpful and easy way to communicate with someone across the street or across the ocean. Without a dabt computers do nothing but benefit the people of our society. First of all, computers are a big source of knowledge. Many people @MONTH1 want answers to a question they have encounterned recently but cannot find the answers in a book or newspaper so they turn to a computer and immediatley their problem is solved. Computers today hold every bit of information on every topic imaginable from history to politics. All one has to do is find a site such as @ORGANIZATION1, type there question, and millions of answers pop up assuring a solution to the problem. Computers can also provide a place to research for a project or statistics of the economy if needed by school, buisness, or just for recreation. Times are changing fast and the sources of the worlds history and school subjects can easily be found in the corner of the internet. What you @MONTH1 have looked for in books and papers can be easily found on internet at the click of a button. Clearly, computers are a huge source of knowledge for our society. Second of all, computers and the internet support many buisnesses in advertising and making profit. Every single time a visit to the internet occurs many different buisnesses are able to advertise their products and overall buisnesses with pop-ups, side bars and websites. It clearly helps the workplace get attention. Along with advertising products buisnesses can even sell their products online without doing a thing. This can also aid the consumer because they would not have to drive all the way down to the store and pick up what they need. All they need to do is select the items they wish to purchase and await for its arrival a few days later. Clearly, the computer and internet can help support the welfare of buisnesses. Finally, the computers we use today are a huge and easy way of communication. Contact with people from another street, town, state, country, can be established by the use of social networking sites such as, @CAPS1, @CAPS2, @CAPS3. You could send a letter with the touch of a button with out having to make a trip down to the post office and await a reply. An instant message, which can be used on any of the sites mentioned can also be achieved. This is where you could write something down in the computer, send it to anyone and receive a reply within seconds. Obviously, computers play a big role in the communication of one to another without a problem. In conclusion, it is clear computers benefit the society greatly without a side effect at all. Computers are a good source of knowledge, an aid to buisness, anda great way of communication. Everyone as agreed to this without hesitation so you should too. Computers are the best things that have ever happened to our society today.
8	Dear local newspaper, @PERCENT1 of @CAPS1 own computer. This illustrates that computers must have an positive effect on people if most people own them. I believe computers do have a positive effect on people because it gives you the ability to talk to other people online, learn about new things, and gives you hand eye coordination. My first reason why I believe computers have a positive effect on people is because it gives you the ability to talk to other people online. Some people dont have phones but do have computers. If you needed to contact somebody you could do it using a computer. Also some people have family and friends who live across the world. Computers are great for keeping in touch, it also wont cost you a lot for long distance, like phones would. Because computers give you the ability to talk to friends, family, and other people it is a positive thing because it is important to do so. My second reason why I believe computers have a positive effect on people is because it gives you the ablity to learn about new things. Learning about new things using a computer gives a positive effect on people because you dont have to travel and go places to get information to learn about things. You could do by a click of a button. People could use the computer to learn about anything or everything. Being able to not have to leave your home to gather information about new things gives a positive effect on people because now more people will be able to learn more because they have more time than they would traveling places to get information. This is a positive effect on people because the more you know the better. Having a lot of knowlage is a good thing and will do good things for you in the future. My third reason why I believe computers have a positive effect on people is because it teaches people hand and eye coordination. Having hand and eye coordination gives a positive effect on people because your going to need it through out live. If you dont have good hand and eye coordination, it is a bad thing because you use it for just about every thing, such as driving, writing, and excercizing. Computers give you the ablity to learn eye and hand coordontion throughout life which is why it is a posite thing for people. I believe computers have a positive effect on people because it gives you the ablity to talk online to people, learn about new things and teaches you hand and eye coordination. I hope this letter persades you to believe that computers do have a positive effect on people.
8	Can you imagine how difficult life would be without a computer? I can I believe computers are helpful. Computers help us do research they keep us connected with friends and family and they are required to be used at some @CAPS1. The internet is a easy way to do research. All you have to do is search what you want information on and millions of articles will be at the click of mouse. Using the internet on a computer is much easier than going through books looking for something. That could waste a lot of time. The internet can quickly and directly answer your questions. Computers are a great way to keep connected. Almost everyone has a email now. All you have to do is type a few letters and you'll be reaqquainted with a old friends. When you call someone you can't be sure if they are busy or not. When using email the person recieving the email can reply when they howe free time. Computers are used at many @CAPS1. Sometimes you're even required to use it. Computers organize data by keeping documents in different files computers also have valuable programs that could help you in your career. Such as @ORGANIZATION1 word. Using a computer would aid you financialy. Some of you might think computers have misleading information. The internet isnt always a honest place. By spending a few minutes double-checking your information on other websites, your still spending less time than it would take to find the fact in a book. The computer is one of the greatest inventions created. It makes research connecting with friends, and your @CAPS3 easy! Use a computers @DATE1 and your life will be changed for the better. 
8	Dear @ORGANIZATION1, In my opinion, spending too much time online has negative effect on society. People aren't getting a full social experience when they talk on email, facebook and twitter. Being on such sites has taken up time that could be spent in other areas, such as family, friends and school. They aren't being able to enjoy the outdoors and being able to exercise. Though online activity can be helpful spending too much time can be harmful. Interacting online can be a great experience for those who have friends and family who live far away. But spending too much time online can damage you social activity levels. In person interaction is better than online, because you see how the person you're talking to is reacting to everything you say. Having a good, positive social environment is benificial to you and your friend. Spending too much time on the computer can also damage you social relationship with your family. For family who live far away, and online is the only way to socialize, online interaction is a great thing to have. But for you close family, you could be missing out on their lives and how they are doing. Your relationship with you family could be in jeoporady because you insist on using your computer. When you use the computer, you're probably eating some food too. And spending time online is taking away your time from exercising those calories off. The obesity level in @LOCATION1 is increasing, probable cause being over-usage of computers. being outside is another thing missing from our lives because of computers we aren't experiencing the beautiful nature life our @ORGANIZATION1 has to offer, online activity is hurting our health, and making us not enjoy our outdoor life. In conclusion, being online too often is abusing our social, health, and taking up too much of our lives. Using the internet is good for adults so they can pay taxes, work at home, and do many other beneficial things for them and their families. But for other, less useful sites are being used to interact. Why not just call or meet up with person, instead of using the computers?
8	Dear local newspaper, I disagree with the affects that computers have on kids. Computers lets kids do what they want and They dont have to travel far to see certin things. Like if you wanted to see the @LOCATION1's @CAPS1 your not just going to get a plane and fly there when you could get pics and information right on the computer in a couple minutes. Its good if you want to see it in person but you wont want to pay money for plane tikets or travel really far when you can just see it from home. Computers have a lot of fun stuff on them like myspace, @CAPS2, and games also its got almost everything you can think of. So why travel when you can see all of it on your computer. I think that computer can sometimes be a little adictive but you got to learn to stay off of it most of the time but it is very easy to learn stuff on a computer. Computers are used by billions and they a great way to learn stuff about are whole world and the things that are on it. It has information web sites like google or bing to look up anything you want to look up. Computers are almost everywhere in phones, I-pods, and even some are put in car like police cars. Computers are very useful to people of the world @DATE1 I bet that the people who make them will make new ones that can go on almost everything. They have computers in almost every building like hospitials, fire stations, police stations, and electronic stores like radioshack. Your going to learn a lot more on computers than having to travel places and or school. In my mind we should all have computers because there fun and you can learn about everything you could think of so we should all have them. So i think that computers are very useful and can teach you a lot about the things that go on in our world to day so I disagree with what scientist or people say about computers and the affects it has on certin people of @DATE1.
7	Dear local newspaper, @CAPS1 stand on this hole computers thing is that it is becoming a big issues because people are spending all there time in books instead of comuitateing with friends and family, exercising, or injoying nature. Just like the expert then tinker siad in his book called @CAPS2 by computers &quot;To much time on the computers and not the rackemed saven hours outsiad can make you very wnight.&quot; @CAPS3 @CAPS4 why people should get out more is @CAPS5 they can have coumite shion with friends and family. I bet you did not know that @PERCENT1 of kids from @NUM1 to @NUM2 are siting on thier cowth or play vite games as we. Another @CAPS4 is that people need more exercis. more the @NUM3 of the leading of the country will be abeast due litle exercise, and that is mostly because of computers.And the last @CAPS4, and the most importint as well, is @CAPS5 people can injoy nature at its fullist, blivie it or not but jack cup thinks @CAPS5 too he said '@PERCENT2 of people how injoy nature will @NUM4 years longer and people now not will likely have a heart in there @NUM5's&quot; @CAPS5 that is why I think computers are bad for people but it is not just me it is @PERSON1, jackup @CAPS6, sisintsits, and many percentages as well.
10	Computers have caused many people money, friends and time. In fact, since that the computers came out this year, lots of people has been spending web to much time of them. Which can cause people to loose time and friends. Computers and technology today have had a very influence on very many people. Spending too much time on computers can cause to loose time and money. For example, my oldest brother was very large at the age of @NUM1 or @NUM2 because our computer started working, but this had a positive impact on him, he started participating in sports such as basketball and lacrosse and that he was very at them and followed lacrosse through highschool. While doing this he and saves my parents money. This is @CAPS1 reason how computers have had a negative effect on people. The new technology has caused people to loose lots of time when they could be doing other things that would them in life. For example, many people in the @LOCATION1 have half of their day to computers, and not getting the exercise of this are video games of the day on computers. This is @CAPS1 affect that computers can have on people is loosing or with friends. For example, I used to be friends a person, but then he did not talk to me for almost the entire @DATE1 because he was always on the computer, which made me think that he did not want to be friends but actually he just deleted almost all of the the @DATE1 to the computer. Since this helped I have been over to his house about @NUM3 times this year as to every @DATE2. This is @CAPS1 way computers can change your life. The time has come to decide whether to have a computer or not to have in computers. In my mind I that it would be best for everyone if we did not have the on computers, but if you do that we should have the an computers than put a certain time wait on computers. In your so you and your family members don't loose time, exercise time, or friends. Overall, I think that it would be best for everyone if we had a time on computers to the whole day on them.
9	Wouldn't you say that having a computer in your house is helpful? It provides useful information to everyone. It can be used for personal use, such as for talking to friends. If there is a child in the house they might have to search something up on the internet for school. If you need directions to a place or you want to find out more about a specific person, a computer can help you. If you have a child who likes to run up the phone bill because they like to talk to their friends just tell them to use a computer! These are so many ways communication can be made through a computer such as @CAPS1, @CAPS2, @CAPS3, @CAPS4 @CAPS5, @CAPS6, and even email! If you need to make quick plans maybe for a movie with a couple of friends just send them an email or a message on @CAPS2. Now, an @CAPS1 you can text people right from your computer! If you're afraid someone might not get the email in time, just enter their cell phone number on @CAPS1 and a text. It's free too! Now that our world has become more technologically advanced schools often tend to tell students to look something up on a computer or maybe to do a homework assignment posted on their webpage. If a child does not have a computer at home this will. Make it hard for them to do their homework. Also, if a perent decides to start a business from have a computer would be required to cant up profits and to talk with customers. A computer can also make signs for a business or business cards. Need directions to a restaurant? Or maybe a local gym? A computer can help you find directions to almost @CAPS10 plan on earth. @ORGANIZATION1 @CAPS11 is a reliable website to get directions. You can also learn about specific people if you type in their name in @ORGANIZATION1. If you need someone phone number but don't have a phone book you can use @CAPS12 pages to help you. So, now I hope you can see that computers effect people in a positive way. They help you keep in touch with friends and save you money. They help students learn more and could possibly help you start your own business from your home. If you need directions or help finding a phone number, a computer can help in multiple ways. Having a computer could make you have draw perspective of everything.
8	@ORGANIZATION1, my name is @PERSON1 and i just want to tell you that we should stop using computers because we get no exercise, we barely go outside and we don't even or talks to our friends or family any more. Local newspaper i think that we should have computer but not because many people aren't doing anything. Many people aren't exercising because their taking on facebook or playing games. Many children aren't even going outside and seeing nature and playing. Many families are all on computers and they are not spending any family time together gofly kites. What im saying is that yeah people like computers and go and talk to there friends and play games but its destroying the parents and and even families. i don't think have computers. Also local newspaper we need to go and the @DATE1 and go doesn't happen. many children go they're on the computer. many parents go hiking, camping, swimming and lots of other stuff but they that anymore. These people need to get a change. What im talking you guys is take the computer away or. One last thing local newspaper is that many kids and children and parents need to have more time. Maybe if and parents weren't all they they would pick that might be sick or ill. Maybe they might go out somewhere to have two together like lake or six flags. many parents that they get computer because it's so fun so they. Many people world complain about it. So i think everybody should be off computers. i think we shouldn't have computer society because you get no exercise, you barely go outside and see nature and you hang out or talk with friends and family so i think computers gone now.
8	Computers are good for school uses, skills, and just for fun. Computers are a good source to have, now that is just my opinion. But, I think computers are mostly for pre-teens and teenagers. Adults mostly use them for business. The fun uses that the computer provides are @CAPS1, @CAPS2, @CAPS3, etc. @CAPS1 is one of the most popular chat groups on the internet, @CAPS2 is another popular chat group. They both have some of the same characteristics like chatting to your friends, updating your status every now and then uploading pictures, songs, etc. There are websites that could be used for free time like music websites where you are allowed to watch music videos or downlosd music onto your ipod. @CAPS3 is a website teenagers of kids go on to watch some of their favorite music videos. Itunes is the program where you can download any song, music video, tv show, or movie onto and ipod. Computers also provide microsoft @CAPS5, publicher, powerpoint, etc. All these can be used for school purposs. @CAPS5 allows you to type up anything you want for school. You can type up a @NUM1 page essay if you wish. You can cut and paste pictures for a project you might have due. You can change the colors, font size, and font style on @CAPS5. That use could be for a design on the front of a cover page for an essay or project. Publisher can be used for projects as well. In school of you need to make a newspaper, flyers, business cards, etc. publisher alloews you to make them. Powerpoint is a program where you can make different slides in anything. Computers can be put to good use for many different things. If people don't agree with that then they don't understand that computers help children and adults with everyday things. Some kids who have special needs @MONTH1 need the computer to comunicate with others. Computer, I think, are a big help in the world.
11	Dear @CAPS1, I believe that computers have a very positive effect on people. Now as technology keeps advancing there are many educational options online, you can now interact with people without physically being with them and you can play games that will enrich your lives. Firstly, I believe that computers offer a wide variety of educational options. On the internet alone you can view your school textbook. You can also have extra practice with the many resources that come with the online textbook. Without physically bringing your textbook home you can view the book online. There are tons of extra practice, and practice quizes in the online textbook that are perfect for studying. Also, when you see on the internet you can get real time updates of major events in the world. For example, the other day I logged onto the internet and saw an article about the earthquake in @LOCATION1. I saw nothing of this in the newspaper, but the internet was so up to date that you can stay informed about something that happened only a few minutes ago. But if you choose not to utilize the internet, there are many programs that are very helpful for learning. That are direclly cetered to developing your children's math and reading skills. These programs can give anyone a jumpstart in education. Another opportunity that could be helpful on a computer is the ability to interact with other people. Video chatting, @CAPS2, and using social @CAPS3 sites are very good ways to interact with people. When you video chat you can have a conversation with some on class on video! Even most they are not physically with you talk to. Instan messaging is a less direct, but still useful who talk to someone far away. You can share the news or just have a conversation with anyone you know. Lastly, social @CAPS3 sites such as facebook, and twitter are a valuable way to communicate with people. You can past messages, play games or simply talk to someone on these websites. They certainly take the best parts of online interaction and put them together. Finally, there are many online games that are very useful. If you ever wanted to go bowling but you never had the time you could play a game online. Or if you have ever wanted to drive a stock car you could play a game online. These online games are good ways to sire you the opportunity to do something you wont normally do. Also many games help sharpen your reflexes and your quick thinking skills. These could possibly cary over into the situations where you need good reflexes and quick thinking. Games could possibly be very useful when you need to prepare yourself something. Also online games are for and enjoying also. Overall I believe the computer is a valuable resource in advertion, interacting with other people and playing useful games. After all who could pass up the opportunity to better prepare yourself for life?
8	Do you love technology? More and more people in this world are using so much technology and especialy computers. But not everyone agrees that this benefit society. But I do. Because it can glue people the ability to learn about anything they want to learn. Then it can give a better communication to others that lives farther away from you. My last reason is this technology can be a good way of protecting this country. Now I agree that computers can be useful man made sorce. When I was about @NUM1 years old I loved to play on the computer I thought that this was just a game. But my dad told me that do not abuce the computer, use it for education. I found out that theres so many things to teech about just a click of a botton. Now you can use this technology as a tool not a game. You might not want to go to the library to find a book you can just look it up in the computer. People love to talk to others, to meat new people or just comunicate to others who live in a other country. One of the best ways are on the computer. I am @NUM2 years old and I have alot of friends that chat on the computer, and I am one of them. My family members live in @LOCATION1, and I just can't catch, a plane every day to go visit them. So I just go on the computer and talk to them it's one of the fastest ways and fun ways to. The @ORGANIZATION1 has one of the strongest @ORGANIZATION2 and @ORGANIZATION3 in the world. You would not believe the technology they have and how they use them. One of the best things they have is the &quot;@PERSON1.&quot; @CAPS1 a plane drivin by a remote control. It's just like a fighter plane but without a pilot! The person controling it can relax in bace wile the @PERSON1 does all the work now come and join me to say that computers are useful in this world! From the reasons above, I state that computers are useful because they give people the ability to learn about anything they want. It gives' a way to comunicate. Last @CAPS1 a good way to protect this country. Technology is growing faster by the minute and strogger. So take my word &quot;don't abuse it, use it.&quot;
8	To whom it @MONTH1 concern: I think computers have a great effect on people. Computers are useful for homework, it allows you to keep in touch with out of state family, you can also look up direction and information to a place. Computers are good for last minute situations. Computers are very useful for homework because when you type a report it looks more professial. While you type a report you can also research on your project at the same time. In some cases there are people who write very slappy to a paint where he or she cannot read his own writing nor can a teacher. A sloppy writer can use the computer to make his or her paper neat. If a child or parent cannot go to the library for some reason they can use their computer at home. If you are a parent at home busy with kids and need to do work; there's no need to go anywhere stay home and use your computer. If a child is absent from school you can go to the school's website and find out the homework. Do you have out of state family you wish to talk to? If so wouldn't you want to be a able to talk to them without a expensive phonebill? A majority of people would say yes. Using the computer to keep touch with family is not so expensive at all! Some examples are aim, emails, and other networks and they don't cast money at all its free. When there's a day you have nothing to do, don't you just want to go somewhere for fun? Don't you want to do something just to get out of the house? Well if there's a last minute decision or situation the computers there to help. Before you go somewhere and you want know a little more go on the computers. Not only will you get information on the place you can also get directions. Now you can go somewhere instead of staying home bored. In conclusion, computers do have a great effect on people. It can be useful to both adults and children. Teachers can calculate students averages easier and faster and children can do their homework efficiently. You can also keep in touch with friends. Overall computers are useful.
8	Isn't it great getting a refreshing when your outside? Wouldn't you experiences the rush of jumping into the crashing waves of the @LOCATION1 instead of sitting inside, gazing at pictures of the @LOCATION1? You might think that computers are helping society today, but you are wrong. The human race has survived over hundreds of years without computers and we can survive hundreds more. Computers are helping society become more and more lazy. We can get just as much information out of books if we try our best. Hand-eye coordination is important, and we can get it though activities, such as football, and tennis. We can also get it from activities! Drawing, reading, and even playing an instrument can all improve hand-eye coordination while letting you explore your creative side. Some people believe that computers teach hand-eye coordination, and it can but there are better ways to get it. It would take longer to get it from a computer than an activity. Many people like to travel in all different places of the world, but going to a foreign area with no knowledge don't smart at all. So what do you do? Go the most convinient source, internet. But what if I told you that any person could put anything on the internet? You could be getting info on @LOCATION3 when you think you're getting info on @LOCATION2. The most reliable source would be from a book. Reading is very powerful, especially if you're reading from a good source. Kids lately have been making lives on the internet. The only way they communicate is through online chat. Chatting online can/should never replace time in person with friends. Relationships with others online is never real. We're using our knowledge of how to communicate with others. The internet isn't worth it. So as you can see computers are no good. Thank you.
10	Dear @CAPS1 post, Computers are an advance in technology, in a good way. They do benifit are society grately. Its a way that family members can keep in touch, it makes your life easier booking a flight and keeping a flight and tastly they help kids with school work. They can bring people together. Firstly, they are a great way to keep in touch. In my own expierence I have a brother at college and when I miss him or need to talk to him I can always send him an email or vidoe chat with him. Do you have someone, you don't get to see everyday? It can really make your family closer, because you talk more, with your realitives, and with friends. Friends more and go away but you can always chat it you need them. In a time of pain all you want is a friend. When the friends away, a computer probably helped our, too, just getting there. Booking plans without a computer would be a hasal, waitting on the phone for hours, at end, with computers you can do it all in all about five minutes. I have had a expierence when my plane was canceless but didn't know until, she went on the computer and checked. So she just switche are flight and we were off but could you imagine going the next day to find out that your flight was canceled and try all day to get on a flight and might not. With computers you can check every hour on the hour if you like. It well even say if there delayed so you don't wait in the airport for five hours. When it comes to traveling computers are a hesasity. Has that ever happened to you? Most likly. Yes once you were happy you had a computer. On the other hand, it also helps with your education. When class is over and your teacher is trying to scramble to get the homework out, mostly no ones listioning all they want to do is scat. About nine out or ten kids won't know the assignment when they get home that night. I know thats happened to me. As a eighth grader you probably did the of just forgeting all about and just taking the concerned. You could use your computer. Most schools use some or device, here at @CAPS2 he have were all are teachers post, grades, test/quizs coming up and homework. It's just one click away from every thing we need. It all right there, together. Most @CAPS3 kuchers will be a let happier if their kids come, in with there homework then without. Wouldn't you be? From school fund raisers to the lunch menu its all there. In conclusion, computers do help us from everyday use. to special uses. It helps use make are family stronger, help us keep are flight out and help us get homework, for school the next day. Computers are a help to the society, in a great and convienent way.
9	I walked into my living room one night and saw my mom on the computer. I thought to myself &quot;she is always on that computer, doesn't she work to do?&quot;. I said to my mom &quot;I think we should have an hour two of the computer each night, or not have one at all.&quot; I told her that I think computers are a bad choice because you don't know who is on the internet and is trying to talk to you. Also, it gets in the way of exercising and spending time with family and friends. The internet/computers are very dangerous now a days. You never know if someone is a friend or a predator trying to get you. Say if you were talking to someone and you thought it was your friend, well you don't know for sure if it is then or not. I could be an older man or women trying to get a hold of you so they can probably kidnap you. Steal from you and worse. Now I watch the news and see many kidnapping because kids are talking to people on the internet and don't know who they are or what they look like. Like, when a girl was talking to a man and she thought it was her friend, turns out it wasn't and she got in a whole lot trouble. Maybe if she met him she would have gotten very hurt and be scared of that memory for the rest of her life. Family is very important to most families now a days. I have heard that spending time with family would bring your grades up in school because as you talk to them, you learn new things. Sadly this is not happening because people are so isolated to their computers they don't spend one minute with family or friends. I have a friend who is always on the computer. She never spends time with her family or friends. She is so focused on the computer screen then what is going on around her. Recently she has been getting off the computer and making more time with family and friends. Even her grades started going up because she spending more time studying with her mom and dad, then being on.... for example @CAPS1 or myspace and not getting any work done for school. In other words, she is very happy in life now and has changed from this experience she has gone through. Most people think you can use your brain for knowledge and call it exercise. That is one way to put it but it is not exercise for your body. People have spent more time having their eyes glue to the computer screen that they don't go out and play or maybe go a gym. The rate of obecity in our country is increasing for many reasons and lack of exercise is one of them because people spend to much time watching tv and being on the computer. I have a little cousin who is over weight and should be out playing sports and exercising. But does she, &quot;no&quot;... She spends her free time on the computer in a stuffy room, instead of getting fresh air from outside. She keeps asking me how did I get and what age, and I keep telling her, I exercise and play sports so I can't tell you when. I keep saying that to her but she never listens. To this day she is still the same because she didn't take my advice to get off the computer and go outside to play. I strongly agree that we should have only two hours of the computer each night or have no computers at all. For kids saftey from bad people out there in the world, spending time with family and friends and finally for exercise and to stay fit with our bodies. I hope people understand what I say and take action to persue them in they own life and convice others too.
8	Dear @CAPS1 or @ORGANIZATION2, local paper @CAPS2 @CAPS1 or @ORGANIZATION2 edioter of local @CAPS4 paper. I'm writing a letter to tell you about the effect of computer on people in a society. I think that computers help society learn and helps people to talks to others around the world. Computer help society learn about faraway areas of the world, to learn about the history of an area, and to study animals and habits unable to reach with out travel. Computer make @CAPS14 easier to learn about area that are hard to research like @PERSON1 and cliff of the @CAPS5 in @LOCATION1, @CAPS6 to learn about history of an area or cities of ancient @CAPS7 like @ORGANIZATION1 in @LOCATION2 of @CAPS5. Help study animals species and the habits they could home like the @CAPS9 @CAPS10 or the hasin in @CAPS9 or the species call the @CAPS12 @CAPS13. Computer help society learn about all this. Computer also help people talk to other around world like you can hold a confeti on you computer when you are home, @CAPS14 is easier to talk and ask questin with others as you are on vacation, and you don't have to pay to travel to a place to have a confess with others. You can hold a confess on your computer from home when you can't make to @CAPS14. @CAPS14's easier to talk and ask question about something important to your business. You can go on your computer and talk with other people without spending money to travel there. This how computer help people talk with others around the world. This how computers help socity learn and talk to other around the world. @CAPS1 or @ORGANIZATION2 edioter of local newspaper.
10	@PERCENT1 of people agree that computers make life less complicated. I also agree with this. Using computers teaches hand-eye coordination, gives people the ability to learn about faraway places and people, and lets people talk online with other people. I think that these are all very important. Why wouldn't you want to have strong hand-eye coordination? I think this a very important skill. Computers help teach hand-eye coordination and they keep it strong. While you're looking at the screen your hand is moving the mouse where you want it to go. Good hand-eye coordination is used for a lot of things; mostly everything. If you play some sports like baseball, hand-eye is one of the most important elements. Why not make that stronger off of the feild? Also, hand-eye can be used to @ORGANIZATION1 while taking notes. Hand-eye is involved with almost everything you do. you can't have a poor hand-eye coordination or else you won't be able to function properly. @NUM1 out of @NUM2 doctors agree that hand-eye very important for healthy living. I love to travel, but I want to know about the place I'm going to before I get on the phone to go there.&quot; said @PERSON1, a science teacher at @ORGANIZATION1. He feels the way, I'm sure, a lot of people feel. They want to know about the place they are going to and they want it to be current. The computer has plenty information about a lot of different places in the world. Some books don't offer as much information or they need to be updated. Computers are also very good for learning about other cultures and traditions. No one wants to be ignorant right? People want to know what's going on in the world quick and easy. The computer does this. I remember when I was about @NUM2, our phone broke in our house. We couldn't go out and get one right away either. The only way we were able to communicate with our family and friends was by computer. The computer made it easier to e-mail everyone and tell them why we weren't answering our house phone. This happens more often than you think. People need to communicate through computer a lot. At work, if you need to talk to an employee or co-worker and you can't leave your desk, you can just e-mail the information to them. @NUM4 out of @NUM2 employees say that it is much faster and easier to e-mail information as opposed to talking them on the phone or in person. A lot of people agree that computer make life a lot easier. Computers teach hand-eye coordination and they let you communicate with other people. The most critical reason is that computers let people learn about faraway places and people. You can make a difference in the way people feel about computers. Write to your local newspaper. It's now or never!&quot;
8	Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 name is @PERSON1 and I do not believe that computers are very beneficial to our society. Computers donot benefit us because they are stoping many people @CAPS3 exercising and healthy life, playing sports, and enjoying the outdoors. Computers are stoping many people, particular the younger generations, @CAPS3 exercising. Now a days instead of bitting the gym many people are home on the computer talking to friends or playing computer games. As a result many people are not as healthy as they should be. It's also recorded that any person who is on the computer for large amounts of times are hurting thier eyes, resulting in an increase of people wearing glasses. If people were to go and start doing things besides the computer they will live a happier, healthier, and better life. Unfortunatly, many young people are not getting in to play sports. During this decade many sports games have come out for the computer. Now instead of pushing themselves to work hard for aspact, kids ethier play with no heart or dont play at all. The reason for this is because they can instead work extremly hard on thier custom @CAPS4 or @ORGANIZATION1 teams in @PERSON2 or @NUM1. Also the computer is not the only electronic stoping kids @CAPS3 playing sports, xbox, playstation, xbox @NUM2, psp, @NUM3, gamecube and gameboy are some of the few console systems that play games that distract kids. I myself, had been caught thinking more about on xbox game then @CAPS2 own hackey game! not olny are these electronics pulling kids in like magnets but the parents are they are alarming thier kids to play video games or stay on the computer for hours on end. Many of us dont know what its truly like to go outside and camp. do not to spend time with thier family. I came @CAPS3 on @CAPS5 family and many @CAPS5 families are very close, so its natural to be doing things with @CAPS2 father or brother or whole or cousin. However not to many families are as close as so they do not do something togther. If some fathers took thier sons fishing or camping, it would get them away @CAPS3 computers and the father/son band will become stronger. These are @CAPS2 reason sir and they should be thought over far quite sometime. Just remember that many people need to exercise, many play sports, and many families got to exprience the outdoors.
10	Dear Newspaper, People use computers in their everyday lifes, &amp; having computers has become customary to many people throughout the @LOCATION1. We go on computers for research, writing papers, or just for pure entertainment, in all these ways computers are very helpful. But, like all good things, too much computer time can be harmful. Sure they provide our lives with knowledge, info on the outside world, &amp; connections with people from just about anywhere, but some of us become too attached with this virtual life instead of living our own real lifes. This happens to many people, some don't even notice what computers are doing to them. For most people, life @MONTH1 be challenging &amp; the real world to stressing, so they retire to the computer for awhile, &amp; to me this is fine, but when someone were to keep doing this it would become an addiction. Instead of relaxing by taking a walk or reading a book, they go to the computer, this would not be good for their social life or their minds. In my opinion, minds need to think, they need excerise by puzzling over something or figuring out a problem. Sure you think your brain is thinking by playing a challenging computer game, &amp; sure, in some ways, it is. But it could reach its full potential by doing something else thats not straining your eyes so much. Computers can be good, but not for everything in your life. Now what about your social life Computers can be a helpful resource in many ways, but not if you let them become a destruction. This @MONTH1 happen by letting the computer be your constant companion. Now a days people have come up with online games where you can interact with other people. This isn't neccessarily bad unless your whole social life is only with these online people that you really don't know, instead of with real people that you see at school or meet on the everyday streets so what I'm saying is that a talking with people online isn't bad as long as you put them as secondary friends &amp; have real people come first. Like I said in the beginning computers are part of our everyday life, and its not a bad thing, they can be very helpful. But you must control what you do on them and how much you use them. If you do that you will most likely have a much more balanced lifestyle. Making you, your friends, &amp; family a whole lot happier.
9	Dear Newspaper people, @CAPS1 you might heard on the @ORGANIZATION1 new, more and more people thing computers are the benefits of society. I personally agree with them. I think that theyare making people missing out of new things, missing out of meeting new people, and looking out on exercize. Time flys by fast. Things can fly over your head and you might not notice them. Have you ever ben on a computer for an hour. It might have felt you were on for @NUM1 minets. Many people ben on it for a hole day. You could of missed a year of stuff. New things like the new ipod nano with camra be invend and you would of not known. Also, the ipod. You could down load books andd read them on there. There also new things to try like jumping art of a plain or bungy jumpimg. You could be going to new place around the world. Traveling to @LOCATION1, @LOCATION2 or even under water. Even going to @LOCATION2 and having a melting, warm, right of the oven tayst cheese pizza. My mouth is grulling for just thinking about it. How many people do you know. What about on facebook or myspace. @CAPS3 not you should go to the park. Meet some people. Just going to a family house, you can be interacting. Everyone should be interacting with someone. Even two year olds need to interact with other two year olds. Thats they learn how to share @CAPS2, your not two anymore but its good to know someone. Learning how others think too. You @MONTH1 think your way in good and the other erson way is not. Thats called interacting talking about it. @CAPS1 you might see on news how many familys have someone in the familys having weight problems. Meny shows like biggest losers @CAPS3 it chanels are trying to help these people lose weight. But what cams this? It could be not eating right, or not excresing right. But the problem could do with computers. Many people are spending @NUM2 mins on the computer, than @NUM3 excersising. Just a quick walk around the lock can make you lose at leat @NUM4 callories. Other might rather stay on the computer and gain @NUM4 callories. And some deaths are around by a heart attack. This @MONTH1 caused by plack billed up or weight going. In sted of reaching for an apple many americans reach for that foods. I think we should still use computers but cut down the rtimes we use it and exercise and eat more. You might think after reading this letter. Thinking people wont lisen about excersing and meeting new people or palces. But, the one thing we can do is to at least insire one person. That person can inspire another person. This can go on and on. Little by little we can help people what they can do with out using an computer.
8	Dear local newspaper, The question that everyone is asking is do computers benefit to society. I used to think they didn't benefit to society but now I think they do. I think this because, one good place to get information, two we live in a technological advanced society, and three you can keep in touch with people that are at the other side of the world. so do computers really benefit to our society? Computers are a valuable resorce for me when I need to get information. For example, in my recent project in social studies class I need to go on the computer to get information on the subject. Also if you need facts on something and you can't go to the libary the computer has the same information. Also the computer is helpful when trying to find maps to a certain place or a phone number to a store. The computer is and always will be a great source of information. In the @DATE1 technology is a huge part of society. For example the first computer that came out was this huge block that when you did something on it you would put in cardboard card. Now we havethin and small portable computers. So knowing how to use a computer is vital to keep up with the @DATE1. So are you going to let technology pass you by? Computers are one of the best ways to keep in touch. For example if you call someone across the world your phone bill will sky rocket. But if you go on a website like facebook you can talk for free. Also another way to chat with people is by A.I.M. Another free way to talk to people. What same person wouldnt want to talk to their friends and family acroosthe worl, for free? The reasons I have given you are valid reasons with deatails. Technology is like a train are you going to live it.
6	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I think that computers do not benefit society. They do more bad than good in my opinion. People aren't on the computer to research people. They are on to check @CAPS3, @CAPS4, @CAPS5. They need to get outside and see the outside world, people should interact with family and friends. Humans that have to much on time on their hands. So their bored maybe they will make a @CAPS3 account or if they already have on then they will maybe one of the games on their and eventually you get addicted to @CAPS3 and you never go off of it. Our society needs to encourage people to get outside and only use your computer to check your email, add something to your ipod, and maybe check if you have any notification on @CAPS3. If you want to really have a great life sitting in front of the computer your entire life isn't going to let you have that kind of fun. Ya need to live your life like your going to die tommorow. Get outside, watch the big game with all your buddies. Go on a vacation get away with your family. Travel the world and rember every part of it. Wouldn't you rather be doing that then to be sitting in front of your computer? We need to inform our state about this problem. There is a reason why we are becoming one of the fastest countries! People are not leaving their house and not getting active. If people avoid their computers then we could be one of the fittest countries.
8	Dear Local Newspaper, The effects computers have an people are not good. They can cause many problems in your life. When your on a computer, are you running? No, your just sitting there; using the computer involves very little movement. You need to be jumping around, dancing, walking with your friends, something! You can gain a lot of weight by sitting down and using the computer all day. Another problem that computers give you is being non social. You can get addicted to a game or something like facebook/@CAPS1 and be on there all the time. You wont talk to your friends as much at school or hang out with them because all you want to do is go on the computer. You are always thinking about just that and no other things in life. Computers can also be very dangerous. If you are on something where you are talking to people you don't know, they can find out things about you and can do to you. It's not at all to talk to people you don't know online. These are or the many problems computers cause. Trust me, I got addicted to a game before.
9	School, family, and sports is @CAPS5 my always tells me. Kids now a days live on the computer. @PERCENT1 of students get out of school and go straight to the computer. Students should spend more time with their families, they should exercise more, and lastly focus more on their grades in school. My initial reason why I agree is because most kids never spend time with their families. All kids like to came home and sit on the computer all day. This is terrible because kids never get to spend time with family and do not show appreciation for @CAPS5 their parents do for them. For example I just want to ask young kids do they thank their parents everyday? The reason I want to ask that is because they should be doing that everyday. In addition my second reason on why I agree is because students need to put more time and effort into school. Kids need to stop spending hours on facebook, @CAPS1, and @CAPS2. Instead of going on those websites they should be on a website such as @ORGANIZATION1 do research. @PERCENT2 of students that go to school either have facebook, @CAPS1, and @CAPS2. For example everyday I walk the halls I over hear students talking about @CAPS5 happen of the computer @TIME1. It's ridiculous how many student do not complet their homework and hand it in late. Lastly my third and final reason on why I agree is because student absolutely do not exercise. A famous baseball player once said &quot;you don not have to be strong, but you have to be fit and athletic.&quot; @CAPS5 this meant was that you had to be in shape. @PERCENT3 of students are not at their weight they should be at because they are obeast and do not exercise. The only exercise students get now a days is their @CAPS6.E. class. Even then students get tired quick and get out of breathe because they are lazy and always on the computer. They need to get off the computer and do push ups, sit ups, and just exercise. For example everyday I get out of school I do my homework and I go run a mile. To add on to the students need to pass there @CAPS6.E. class. In conclusion students should not spend so many hours on the computer and spend time with their family, as well as focusing on their school grades, and lastly they need to get off the computer and exercise more and stay healthy!
6	Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 opinion about computers is good. I think that they can help people with what they need. People can also also contact other people. All computers are helpful and not always something negative when someone uses it. Computers help teachers, students, employees, and parents. They aren't always for just helping. Computers can also be used for amusement. Games, music, and videos are always on the internet. Contacting other people is also a great reason why computers aren't bad. People can always have an e-mail for business and friends. Myspace, @CAPS3, and @CAPS4 are all websites that people can contact others. Having a computer isn't always bad. When you do a story for the newspaper does it come out hand written? You also use the computer to do work. Computers aren't always bad. People have to learn to just limit their time. They can always be a positive affect on people when they need something. Information on anything is always on the internet. Computers have been used for decades and I think they will be used for many many more. Back then people used computers mostly for work. Now people of all ages can use it for all different kinds of things.
11	Computers. An achievement @MONEY1 technology and science that improve all @MONEY1 our lives. They let you explore the world in one click and chat with your friends. What could be wrong with that? I'll tell you. I belive that computers are ruining our society. Now don't get me wrong, I like them, but they can be bad. People get on and never get off, you never no who it is your chating with online, and they can cause tons @MONEY1 stress. Let me explain why computers can ruin lives. When the computer was invented I'm sure this wasn't the purpose. To stay on playing mindless games, or randomly searching the web. Some scientists have even studied the @PERCENT1 @MONEY1 the time, the more you are online, the more likely chance you will become obiece. That is not what @LOCATION1 needs. You say you'll be on for a minute, but you will stay playing &quot;@CAPS1&quot; or &quot;@CAPS2&quot; for days on end. People with @CAPS3 work to do might never get on. Also it is just flat out a waste @MONEY1 time when you could be outside playing a @CAPS3 game. My second reason is that when you are &quot;chatting&quot; or &quot;@CAPS4'ing&quot; someone, who is it really? A study conducting proved that when you think your talking to a friends it is really some perverted @NUM1 year-old looking for &quot;fun.&quot; @CAPS5 huh? Also when you talk, someone could be inbedding a virus in your system that could take @MONEY1 to fix. How mad would your parents be? It could be happening with every letter you press. Finally stranger or not, some @MONEY1 these people leave links to get to disgusting websites that you pray your parents don't see. My final point is that computers are proven to cause more stress. When your on @CAPS6 or @CAPS7, nasty fueds between friends can occur that affect you and your school work, inflicting damge to your grades. For every @NUM2 people when join a social page, @NUM1 get worse grades do to this issue. Also when your parents are online for a long time, the next morning they must rush to get ready for work and are tired, afffecting their quality @MONEY1 work. In this economy I don't think we need more layoffs. Even simple things like a virus or a slow upload could and will cause stress, in fact @PERCENT2 @MONEY1 @LOCATION1 have a stress issue due to computers. I've told you today why computers are bad. They get sucked in stressed out and stalked. Now computers aren't all bad, just use them right. These are the reasons I think computers can be bad.
7	Hello @CAPS1 @CAPS2, @CAPS3 you think computers are having a great effect on people? Well, I sure @CAPS3 think using a computer has a great effect on people. I say this because, people are probably waisting a full day on those facebook, myspace gol websites, looking up diffenitions for words, directions to places etc. If you think about it, this effect on people can ruin their eye-site, and social skills. These people are spending like @NUM1 hours tops on the computer. Staring at that @NUM2 inch little screen can damage your eye-site. This can lead you to getting glasses or possibly going blind. How would your life be without not talking to a girl/guy or even your own family? If you waist your time on those websites for example: facebook all you @CAPS3 is instant message the person. Maybe you should go out and @CAPS3 something fun with that person. What's this I hear about map it.com? Don't be lazy and waist @NUM3 minutes at your day just getting directions. Use a a real map! Also, free @LOCATION1? Come on! Use a real dictionary. So, I come to my conclusion by saying that these computers @CAPS3 have a &quot;great effect&quot;on people. It gives them short cuts through life.
9	Dear The @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3, Computers do not benefit society. They make people antisocial, unhealthy, and do bad things. The internet is very addictive. I use to spend three hours online everyday. I did not get any exersice at all. Also, I was incouraged to eat unhealthy snacks while online. This made me very unhealthy I gained nine pounds in one week. Now, I have dietbeaties. I can't enjoy things like sweets or running. I will probably have arthritus in my hands when I'm older because I spent hours typing away. I used the computer in the dark so now I need contacts. Using the computer is one of the most unhealthy choices ever. II spent so much time on the computer i wasn't able to socialized. I missed out on alot of activities with my friends and family because I was so busy online. I barely talked to anyone unless it was through email. I lost alot of friends and close family members. My pets died because I didn't take care of them. I didn't really want to do anything but go on the net. I messed up on colledge and job interviews. To this day I have no social life and no job because I spent more time socializing with the computer than people. Computers ruined my life. Computers incourage very bad things. Not just unhealthy choices and antisocial behavior they uncourage things against the law. Alot of drugs and weapons are bought online. People kill others or themselves because people gossiped about them online. People don't care for nature and destroy it. People steal so they can buy extra technology. Alot of car robbers happen because someone left technology in there. People gamble through online poker. People hack bank acounts through the computer. Prostitution happens because of online chats. Thier are sex affenders that go online posing as people that want a date when they are rapists. Terrorists can communicate by the internet. Computers are a menace to society. They turn people into low life scums and criminals. Computers should disposed of before they cause the end of the world.
8	Dear Local Newspaper, I think that using computers is a good thing and it does not effect on exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends. Here are three reasons to support my oppinion people learn more on the internet, children at school can go online to find what was for homework, and how the internet does not effect everyday life. My first reason why I think using computers is good because people learn more on the internet, You know what people say, you learn something new everyday. Well, if you are wondering about something or if you're think about something, the internet can help you find what you're looking for, @ORGANIZATION1 is a great site to find what you're looking for. It also has its own images if you need a picture for your project you need. My second main reason to why using the internet is good because if your a @CAPS1, you can go online to check what you have for each subject. If your a @CAPS1 and you don't want to do homework at recessthe next day from being sick. No, you can go online to your schools website and click on your teachers names to see what you have for homework. This way you can still have time to go out side, play with friends, and interact with family members. My third and final reason to why using the internet is good is that it effects everyday life, in a good way. If you don't have a t.v. and you have no idea what the weather is like, you can go online to see if it's going to be snowy, or rainy. This can tell you if you need a jacket or a rain jack, if you need to use a shovel or hold an umbrella. The internet can be useful in everyday life. In conclusion, I think using the internet is very good and will not effect your exercise, or interacting with family. To support this I stated, people learn more on the internet now, children can access homework if you missed a day, and how the internet effects your everyday life in a good way.
8	Dear @LOCATION1 Newspaper, I belive that computers have a very positive effect on people. Computers can help kids with homework. Computers also let people learn new things. You can even communication with friends. There are many great uses for a computer. Kids have lots of homework and without computers it would be nearly impossible to finish it all. At @ORGANIZATION1, students recieve a project almost every month. We need pictures, information, and it must be neat. Computers are about the only way to find pictures, information, and make it neat. Kids also get a ton of homework and computers are very important for it. In science class we get a packet for homework for every new unit and without a computer it would be really hard to get done. You can also learn many things you never knew from using a computer. There are a lot of uses for a computer and one of them is learning. There are many educational websites on computers. If you were traveling somewhere and wanted to find out more about that place you could search it on the internet. Even if you're reading a book and come across a word you don't know you could look it up and you will find it. Communicating with friends is also important and computers offer many different ways of doing it. There are facebook, @CAPS1, and videochat. You could use facebook if you want to talk to friends or videochat also to talk to friends. Those things are great if you want to show pictures from a vacation or talk to a friend in a different country. These are all great ways to use computers. I definately think computers have a positive effect on people. They help with projects and homework, learning new things and communicating with friends. Computers are great.
8	Dear, @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 computers are useful they have a negative affect on people. Due to the advance in computers many people do not go outside as much anymore. People are so busy with computers that they dont even spend quality time with their friends and family anymore. Obesity is also a big issue. Computers are ruining peoples expierence with the great outdoors. Many peope, mostly kids stay inside all day playing video games on computers. Outside there is great things to do like go to the park or play sports. Computers are just taking away from kids and now they dont get to expierence the fresh outside fun and are now a days kids in the @DATE1 stay inside all day, instead of going to fun outside camps. Families now a days are being broken up due to computers. The parents or even kids are not spending lots of time with each other due to the computers. As a result the family starts to lose the bond between each other familys can also develop these ways, youth most likely get attracted to computers, so its either the son or daughter who are not emotionally or physically contacting with the family which is a problem. Health is a big issue when it comes to computers. Whats happening is teenagers or even adults are sitting at the computer playing these games or surfin the web then eating dinner then continueing to surf the web or play the games. After time the starts to become worse and worse and the kids gain weight and keep gaining wait then become obese and unhealthy. This is a problem all over america, that is technology keeps advancing and advancing the youth will become very unhealthy. In conclusion, computers have a very negative affect on people. People are not going outside as much anymore. Families relationships are being ruined and peoples health is at steak! If this does not change americas future will be at risk. 
8	some people learn about far away places, getting the latest up-dates on important news, and making sloppy work and hand writing seem nice neat. All those thing are some positive benefits people have computers. People all over use computers to research other places computers provide photographs of the place he/she is researching. For example: I remember when I had a social studies project on the @PERSON1, and I had to explain why its a great place to visit for its history. Mind I never even heard on a place called the @PERSON1 @PERSON1, but thanks to computers I googled &quot;@PERSON1 @PERSON1 @PERSON1&quot;, then the computer gave me all of info. and photos about the mountain @CAPS1. Now I @CAPS2 where and what the @PERSON1 @PERSON1 moutans look like. Secondly, the computers has all the latest news happening all over the world. I remember when the earthquake in haiti first happened my grandmother had it happen until she got on line to check @ORGANIZATION1 and when, where and earthquake on the richter scale. about computers was a I wasn't the best hand writer in class, and could write it out or do it on the computer, plus we were getting graded on neatness, elaboration, and fluency. I choose to do it on the computer it came out nice and neat with picturs. computers has a very positive benefit on people world wide. now matter if its for info, news, or to make thing neates.
8	Dear local newspaper, @CAPS1 you know any child or teen between the age of eight and seventeen who doesn't live to go on the computer? Well myspace, facebook and aim is like a online hangout. Kids every where log on and don't log out unless the parent of the child makes them. I firmly belive that computers have major effect on people, my three reasons are people don't have the exersise, they dont interact with others, kids are smocky they will sneak on if doing research for if wasnt . Online websites and games are like hipnotysing the people and making them stay on for hours. Most parents belive that having their child on a computer doing research for an hour is good; however kids are and would sneak to pay online going or go to a website they were not allowed to go on and wasnt on before. Sometimes the best thing to @CAPS1 is get some fresh air and interact with others. Buth with websites that make people stay conect for more than two hours they dont get fresh air and they dont interact with others . Most times people forgot and dont know what something is except for how a computer because they play on it so much. People grow up fast when you think about it, and people start to eat, drink, sometimes sleep at the computer. People stay at the computer and eat their, they wont get enought exercise, they will start to get fat and soon an only stay at the computers because they didnt exercise burn the fat off. How you see how computers have a major effect on people by not interacting with others, not having enough, and kids wife sneaky and will go on other website, they wer not allowed to go on and if thier parents wernt home.
8	Dear @CAPS1, I dont think that computers are something that people should be using @NUM1. Computers have something to them where somehow the become addictive. From the people who are gaining weight every day because the sit on the computer and chat all day. Then there are those terrible people on the internet who disguise themselfs so they look like a @NUM2 year old boy when there really a year old man. Lastly, people now a days are using the computer as a sorce of reading instead of books. I just think that computers are ruining the life of many people. For starters, most people today are becoming overweight because they either wacth to much @CAPS2, or they sit on the computer and eat all day. Once you start with the computer you'll never stop. Especially if your multi-tasking where you eat and use the computer. The big problem is people think it's better to be sitting home than out enjoying nature exercising! It really isn't good that people dont get of the computer and start enjoying life. Next not everyone online is who they say they are who make false accounts on like @CAPS3 or @CAPS4. There can be men who say there and really be @NUM3. With all the posting of pictures someone you with it. Just remember to be careful! Lastly, people in todays day in age use the computer to read books instead of going to the library or @CAPS5 and @CAPS6 (or any book store). I think that all those bookstores are going to run out of business because of the technology now a days. When I was younger and I said that I was going to read a book, I was really reading one. I wasn't reading it on the computer. People need to cut down on the electronics. In the end I think that computers are a real waste of time. There is no reason why people should be on the computer instead of exercise. Everyone needs to stay away from the bad people online. Also can we please start using normal books instead of online ones. I think computers need to stop taking over our world and start just being there when we need them.
10	Dear Newspaper, Computers today have a negative effect on people. The valuable time of getting daily exercise is reduced, you will not see your family enough and some of the costs are outrageous! Owning a computer is surely not a good idea. is sitting around all day your idea of a workout? Having a computer would be very bad for your physical lifestyle. Clicking a mouse &amp; typing away are only moving your hands, not your whole body. An individual who doesn't use the computer daily, or f or large amounts of time would be healthier than someone who always uses the computer. I remember seeing a commercial about @NUM1 children &amp; how their lives eneded up later on in life just by their computer usage as a &quot;tween.&quot; Not only will you be unhealthy but anti-socialism is probable too. Many kids, or even adults, spend precious family time playing the sims @NUM2 creating their own ideal family. This however, is not acceptable. Spending time with your family is something precious. When asked about computer usage, @PERSON1 said, &quot;you could easily became addicted with just @NUM2 turns!&quot; @CAPS1 you are addicted, both your family &amp; you suffer. They will stop inviting you places. You wouldn't want to loose the people who are going to be ther for you, on another what. &quot;@CAPS2!&quot; shouts your computer. You have another virus. uh oh, it's deleting your hardware: all your scholastic essays, important book-marked websites &amp; sentimental photographs. Do you have any idea how much it would cost to even try to retrieve this data? Well, it'd be alot. I know youre probably thinking, &quot;This couldn't happen to me,&quot; but in reality; yes it can storing things on a computer is much riskier than having a hard copy. It will also save you more money. Furthermore, appliances use electricity @CAPS1 they're even plugged into an outlet! So when you get your electric bill, don't be surprised, computers can be very costly which, is why it's not worth it to have one. Computers are just another unnecessary thing in life. It will take away from your over-all health, reduce family time, &amp; cost you same big bucks. It is a fact that you can survive without a computer. But without hjealth? Well, you'd be dead. I you to consider my ideas.
9	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I am a student at @ORGANIZATION3 middle school in @CAPS3 @CAPS4 @CAPS5 @CAPS6 recently you produced an article about computers where good or bad people I write today to say that computers are beneficial to people everywhere. This is true because computers help people with things hand eye coordination to learning advances to our schools finally it helps people communicate with ease, @CAPS7 plase consider the following. First of all computers help hand eye coordination greatly in the long run. This is true because people playing games on the computers got more skillful with using ther hands and eyes together. @ORGANIZATION1 ullodhers from @ORGANIZATION4 @LOCATION1 &quot;Computers help hand eye coordination @PERCENT1 more than putting your son or daughter on the football team&quot; @CAPS8 computer games could help kids get more acurate with there skills or that of any sport. @CAPS7 now you know why computers help people develop better hand eye coordination. Secondly Computers help people learn new things. Although people might think to be false it is indeed true. @ORGANIZATION1 a recent study at @ORGANIZATION2 shows that @PERCENT2 of schools in @CAPS6 use computers for research.Finally recently had a paper about @PERSON2 and The only scorce I thought of was wikipedia on the internet because it is faster than searching for a book about him. @CAPS7 now you understand the computer is a helpful learning tests. Finally the computer is a great way to communicate online. It is better than @CAPS10 because it is faster and more than calling someone up and talking for. @CAPS8 it is alot cheper than @CAPS10 because you just have @NUM1 payment a-month unlike phone. Where it starts to add up. Inract @PERSON1 or the @ORGANIZATION2 of @LOCATION1 in a recent study that &quot;@CAPS10 are absolete now, with the internet peope can chat at lignning speed&quot;. Finally using e-mail or facebook is @CAPS7 much better than phone tag on facebook you know where you can chat with. @CAPS7 thats my reasons that the computer is good for communicating. @CAPS7 now you see that computers are nessecery because they develop hand eye coordination, they @CAPS8 help people learn and finally they are a great way to communicate.
12	Dear @ORGANIZATION1, A resent concern has built up among experts that computers @MONTH1 have negitive affects on the society. I do not agree with this. Computers ease life, teach you about faraway places and people, and finaly you can chat with others. I belive computers can only benifit a society. As previously mentioned, computers ease the hassels of life. With computers you are able to plan your life with @CAPS1 output. This program ables you to enter data on places you have to go and reminds you when time is done to that event. With this program you will never forget where you have to go. Also, with the computer you are able to gather information at extreamly high speeds. Supose you are doing a research project in school on types of cars, you just enter cars on @ORGANIZATION3 and get millions of results. this save much time than going on the librery and finding a book. This can take up to on how . Finally, with a couputer handy there are programs for special needs people to wright. New programs such as @ORGANIZATION2 word have a special function called voice commands. This lets a person who can not wright because of blindness or a disability speek to the computer what he or she wants to wright. In an istant it will pop up on the screen. Computer ease peples' lifes jarasticly. Besides esing lifes, computers teach you about far away places and people. pictures on a computer give one a first hand acount of how a far away place is like. Insead of just reading about it you can see it. Acording to time magazine if a person sees a place they will learn more by @PERCENT1 than reading an encyclopedia. As well as pictures, blogs give people an idea of how a person lives in a regular day in that place and how they feel about it. This is another first hand acount of the place. Finally, ebooks on the internet give you a large amount of information. Ebooks are books but in an internet format. These books inclued encyclopedias that give statistics and, pores, and events that are in the far of place. For example if you are planning a trip you can learn where to eat and where to get entertained. you can learn about far of places and people in them with computers. Lastly, with computers you can talk to people around the world. you can talk to friends. Have you ever moved and wanted to talk to a friend from where you previously lived? Now you can esily do so with video chat. Not ownly can you talk to someone you can see them. i remember @NUM1 years ago when I moved to @LOCATION1, I mised my friends in @LOCATION2 so i video chted them. As well as talking to friends, one can have a bussness meating around the world with out having to traval out of your town. For example if a company wanted to make a trading agreement with another company in @LOCATION3 they could do so with a click of a mouse. This will save time and money of travaling. Also you can talk to others online to get a feel of what happened. For example @CAPS2 a few weeks ago, video chated many people in @LOCATION4 to undersand now bad conditions were after earth quake. You can talk to people with ease with an computer availible. In conclusion, I believe computer are benifical to a society. They ease life, teach people about far away places and the people who live there, and alow people to talk to others. Computers open doors in the world. Computers help the society a great deal.
8	Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 you think computers are bad for society. It came to my attention that many people are concerned that computers are not very good in my opinion I think computers are They help typeing skills. Computers are also very helpful with and crofing pictures, and they make it to find information. First of all, computer are very helpful with typing skills. Other people doesn't use computers takes six years to @CAPS3 younger people like young skills use very quickly. Actuly @PERCENT1 of teens can type in a minutes Who takes @NUM1 minutes. Computers have a great effect on many people with their typeing skills. Computers makes it so copier with so many pictures editing and many more, editing pictures from a expensive digital @CAPS2 it for free on your computer? A computers makes it and it through a lack of information to just computer and find it faster. The computer you can look for information make faster. For example you have to @CAPS2 a project on @CAPS4. Instead of going to the library and spending more on a book about @CAPS4 you can go on google.com and type in @CAPS4. So much information and so much faster. Get with the program computers are in. In conclusion, I think computers is a great invention. They make it easier to find information and typing skills. Also they make it so much easier to crop and edit photos, please take my suggestions sereusly.
8	Some experts are concerned that people are spending too much time on their computers and less time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends. I think oposite though. I think this way because you @MONTH1 have to look up something on the computer one day. Some jobs you have to apply by computer. Another thing is a computer allows you to talk online with other people. The first reason why I think using a computer is good for people is because you @MONTH1 have to look up something on the computer one day. What I mean by this is you might have to look up a job, you might want to get away so you look up vactions that you can take or you might have to pay a bill one day. The second reason why I think using a computer is good is because some jobs you have to apply by computer. Such as stop and shop, price right, and save-alot. To add on to that this is good for are society because if we use paper thats killing more trees. The third reason why I think using a computer is a good because this allows you to talk online with other people. Therefore you @MONTH1 need to contact a family member or even an old friend, meet new people or you might not like to talk on the fone, so you rather talk by computer. Now I told you all the reasons why I think using a computer is good. @MONTH1 have to look up something on the computer, some jobs you have to apply by computer, lastly allows you to talk online with other people. These are some good pros. So I hope you take my opinion in consideration.
8	Do you remember the last time you locked something up on the computer? Many people use Computers, but not everyone agrees that this benefits society. Those who support a trances in technology believe that computer have a positive effect on people. I support computers because they help with writing, locking up information and provide communication. One reason I support computers is because they help with writing. You can tell I do not have the greatest hand writing. To help this, I type almost all of my papers. Computers can also help people with spelling and gramar. There are even systems now that let you say something and @CAPS1 will appear on the screen. This is just one reason I support computers. Next, computers are benifical because of the information they can provide. &quot;before computers you would need to go to the libary and find around ten books that might not even have what your looking for. Now you can find hundreds of articals on any topic in minutes. The amount of information out there is un imageinable. I think computers are a great of technology because of the information they can provide. Finally, I believe computer are a benifit to us because of comunication. One term of communication that came out recently is @CAPS2. @CAPS1 is a website that let's you sent messages to a friend, share picture, videos and many more things. E-mail let's you send letters to people via internet instantly. I could go on forever about forms of comunication on the internet. This is the last reason I support computers. Computers are a great benifit to society. They help with writing, communication, and everyone could benifit form computers.
5	Dear @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1 name is @CAPS2 @CAPS3 and I want to tell you why I'm a little bit against computers theres a lot of things you can do in the world, visit places, and go on cruise ships. First I would like to tell about the things you can do you can play basketball, handball, hang with your friends. Also you take your car and go out into a morning drive feel the breeze. Next I would like to tell you about the places you can visit, you can visit your friends house your girl/boy friend your family just do that stop being lazy computers aint helping you with your life stop being lazy. Finally I would like to tell you about the cruise ships you can go far away like @LOCATION2, @LOCATION3, @LOCATION1, and many more. Its fun on a cruise ship captains dinner and meet @ORGANIZATION1 people and @ORGANIZATION1 sights. For conclusion I would say people should stop being lazy on computers and have fun in the world while it lasted.
9	Dear Local Newspaper, I beleive, myself if, that computers are extreemly important to our society in this day and age. Computers help people talk with people. Online, and keep in touch with family and friends. Secondly, I think that computers are important is because they help with learning, even online schooling. Lastly, computers just help for the need of entertainment for people. Computers are one of the most used tools on the planet. Almost every family has one, some people even have more than @NUM1. Let's face it, there are many people traveling around the world, just trying to make a decent living for their families. Computers help them keep in touch, wheather it's by e-mailing them, or even video chat. This makes people happy, and still keeps them informed about what their family members, or friends are up to. For some people, it can re-unite family, by someone searching, I don't know, maybey their long-lost brother, or something. Computers keep families togetherm and you might just got a little surprise every now and again! My we should keep computers because we. Lastly, computers can just be plain fun! Maybe you're looking for some funny videos, just go on and search,&quot;funny videos&quot;, and it will keep you busy for a while. I know that I enjoy downloading music, too, so why should it be any different for other people? If there is a song going through your head, just look it up and I'm sure you'll find what you are looking for. You @MONTH1 be cooking and need a recipie for something, I am sure you're computer is more than willing to tell you whatever you please. All right, so, computers are one of the most important tools, of this world that we live in today. We depend on computers for many things, like keeping in touch with family, helping people learn things, and provide entertainment, just to name a few. Computers can help with countless things.
8	I think that you can never spend enuf time on the computer it feel there is no bad effet computors can have on you they only improve your life is why. For one thing if you need to find out a important fact date or time. You can just look it up on the computor. The internt is a never ending sorce of knolage and you can learn just about any thing that you need to know just by searching it on the computor.Another usefull thing the computor dose is the ability to talk to people useing eother @CAPS1-mail @CAPS2 or that rooms you can meet new people or talk to a distant friend or relitive on the computor and you can even hook up a web camera and actuly see theam as they talk to you something a phone cannot do. Also the computor is a good souce of entertainment. You can play a number of games off the internet. You can even down load consal games onto your computor. Another thing you can do is watch full episodes of @CAPS3 shows and movies like if you wer fallewing a telivison selles and you missed an episode you can just go look it up. And a favorit of mine is youtube wether you watch random videos watch famous youtube stars on post videos of your own ther is always fun to be had. And finaly all the programs on the computer ther is an endless amont of programs you can have downloaded they can be for fun such as paint and flash or they can be important like worn or knot book every program tha computer offers is usefull and fun to use and you can use most of these programs to help you in the real. Now I have mentioned some of the many thing why you can never spend enuf time on the computer shure exersise and nator can be helth but you can do only of that stuff I just mentond by takeing a nator walk so wont you agree computors improve our life more then they are unhealthy.
8	Some experts are concerned about people using computers and not enjoying nature and going outside. In my opinion people should use the computers but not a lot. It's @CAPS1 to use the computer to chat with freinds, search some stuff you never seen. I say this because some people get addicted to computer games, or talking to your freinds the whole day. Next reason is to go outside, you can enjoy more stuff like sports, tag, and other activities. Instead of talking to a freind on the computer go to the park and talk or invite them over to you house. Another reason why I the exports are right about people and computers is to learn about nature and learn how to do things. I hope you have found my interduction good and reading on. My first reason is people getting addicted to computer games and other computer fetures. The reason I say this is because some people do get addicted on computer, it's @CAPS1 to go on it some time's but not to much. It is better to go outside you got fresh air its nice and cold. If you have a dog you should take for a walk or walk with your freinds. My next reason is going outside playing sports or running alround playing tag. Instead of using you could go to the park to play basketball or baseball. There are so many fun thing's you can do outside. You should go to your school and tryout for any sport that your good at. That way when you get bored there is always something to do, instead of being home all day. The last reason why I perfer nature over computers is learning on how to do something. It's better to learn stuff in real life than in computer's. Your dad can teach you how stick bricks together to make a chimny, or on how to use a lawn mower to cut other peoples yard's to make money. 
9	Dear editor, I hear you are looking for your citizens opinion in if computers are bad or good. @CAPS1 opinion is computers are bad. I think computers are bad in three ways and I want to express them to your and hopefully persuade you into going towards @CAPS1 side. Smell nice out to day. I can smell flowers, the grass, and many more, @CAPS1 first reason why computers are bad is if you use the computer to much you don't see enough of enjoying nature. Nature is beautiful, it has @CAPS2, green grass, rainbows (sometimes). You can make a walk of in the moons and just be yourself and be by yourself. In other words nature is very nice and you should set out and enjoy it. If you don't enjoy nature it might be no late, because soon it become and rainy and then, yes fem has flabberlasting colors, but what comes after fall, winter. Winter is not nice, it is cold. You work, because you need to shovel the drive way and your car off and that can get very tire some. The goof of is you can get those chorse. Oh not that make me to. @CAPS1 next reason why computers are bad. When was a good smile run. @CAPS1 next reason why I think computers are bad is spend all working and no time exersing. Excersing is a very fun thing to do, you fel to go outside. Hang with friends, any many shore. Exercise is a main way of staying healthy. don't you can really get unhealthy, and sick and his dies, die i have a friend whom nothing use. The computer his body rest weaker and weaker so exercise ias am main piece of staing healthy. there are many ways to health you can bike, run, walk, rog canate, climb a mountain, etc. The posibilitys are endless while exercesing in the park you never knew you can meet. car's fast say your friend, &quot;yo sup man,&quot; &quot;not, you&quot; &quot;not much, just fiding around for some exercise&quot; &quot;same here, same here&quot; see you never know who you can meet in the park now that was @CAPS1 friend. he is alwasys here, out how as you think, yep in the same park. I wouldn't have met him if i was insine on the computer. Like i said be what was @CAPS1 friend. But since I come here every day i can meet a new friend every day maybe. So @CAPS1 last reason why I think the computer is bad is because you don't get enough interacting time with friends and family. I love @CAPS1 family but I interact with them. If they are exercising who if i am here on the computer. no one can. In conclusion I think the computer are bad because you can not get enought time exercising, enjoying nature, and spending @CAPS3 time with family and friends.
6	Dear local @CAPS1, I think that computers are good for people to have. My first reason is kids might have to write an eassy for school. My second reason is kid might have to look important things up. My third reason is kids might have e-mails. My first reason is kids might have to write an eassy for school. Teachers mostly perfor to have the kids typ their eassys. When kids write eassy's they have to get information on what they are looking. My seocnd reason is kids might have to look important things on. They @MONTH1 have to fill out an alpaction out online when kids get older they want to look up schools they @MONTH1 want to go to. Kids in high school look up collages to get into when they are in like @NUM1 or @NUM2 grade. My third reason is kids migth have e-mails. When kids check their e-mails they are probably trying to see if their parents wrote them. Also some kids don't live near family so they e-mail each other on-line. My first reason is kids might have to write an eassy for school. My second reason is kids might have to look important things up. My third reason is kids might have an e-mail. Now I hope you like the reasons I wrote on why computers are good to have.
10	Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 a student of the local middle school technology is utilized to the fullest. Computers have helped us write essays more efficiently &amp; complete research assignments. However, personally I feel that this constant usage of computers has a negative impact on people. Firstly, computers hinder interpersonal connections. @CAPS4, @ORGANIZATION1 help keep in touch with old college buddies', but no computer can replace face-to-face communication. From hard, cold text, one cannot decipher subtle connotations or wit. Bot, people are beginning to replace seeing one another with @CAPS3 networking. With the technological revolution came games like @ORGANIZATION2. These games are addicting, @CAPS4, our society mocks &quot;nerds&quot; for spending too much time playing these trivial games, but it really is a serious issue. For example, in a recent study done by @ORGANIZATION3 students, &quot;@NUM1 out of @NUM2 teenagers who play computer games do not get the recommended amount of daily exercise.&quot; This is because these games are so absorbing. The amount of time put into gaming. Ultimately consumes all free time. This is dangerous, because a gaming addiction can lead to delusion, @CAPS3 inadequency, obesity. @CAPS2 a people, we are quickly learning that what was once so genius, is actually dangerous. If one was to stare at a backlit screen for hours on and, their eyesight would definitely start to deteriorate. Loss of eyesight is just one of the negative impacts computers have in our health. @CAPS2 aforementioned, obesity is issue. Now, couple this with bad eyesight, @CAPS5 @CAPS6 deficiency &amp; a negative outlook &amp; you've got yourself a issue. All of the deseases brought on by computers can be just by less time on the computer, &amp; exercises. Naturally, @CAPS2 a specie we were not to spend so much time in a fixed position. This static state is a new phenomena that is aquiring major health problems. The over usage of computers practionally, robs us of our time, destroys our health, &amp; hinders our @CAPS3 interactions. This makes computers a negative influence on people &amp; their health.
6	I think computers have a postitive affect on people. Computers are very important to society. You can still interact with Your Family and friends either in @CAPS1 chat or @CAPS2. Computer are also helpful for applying for @CAPS3 like you can look for @CAPS3 you like. You can do @CAPS5 exciseses and useful for @CAPS5 essays. If you have a laptop you can bring it anywhere you want you don't have connect anything it take wireless and you can connect to the @CAPS6. You can look up stuff on the @CAPS6 for your homework and other stuff. Buy things without having to go to the store. These are reasons why computers have a postitive affect on people.
9	Dear @CAPS1, Computers have been an incredible help to many people as they advance in knowlege. But, many people do not think about the negative affects of computers. Computers make research easier to find, and they organize data well and quickly. Computers make comunication easy, but there are many negative affects as well as positive. Chat rooms on computers are a great way to communicate quickly, but they can also be dangerous. More and more kids are spending time on computers, rather than outside excersising and communicating with friends and family. Chat rooms are commonly used by kids as well as adults. Kids use them to talk with friends, make plans, and catch up relatives. But kids aren't the only people that use chat rooms. Adults use them too. Some for good, others for bad. Adults sometimes have chats for their work to talk with their fellow workers. They can communicate easily what has been done and what needs to be done at the office such as what bills have been paid. This is a good way for workers to know whats going on outside of the office. There, are many other useful advantages of computers. Some other advantages of computers are the computers functions. Computers are good for finding information quickly. Computers are useful to find information for school projects. Computers can also take that information, and organize it on graphs, and computer programs such as microsoft powerpoint. Other pluses about computers, are that they can teach hand-eye coordination. Typing can help majority with this. Typing is also another advantage. If people don't have great pendmanship, they can use a computer to type essays, homework, and school projects. This makes reading the assignment easier for the student as well as the teacher. There are many advantages to computer, but there are also disadvantages. More and more kids are spending is their free time on the computer, instead of ouside exercising. This is causing kids to become less active. Being in a chat room all day is also a disadvantage. Kids today are using a new language in chat rooms as well as texting. They are using abrevations for words and phrases, such as &quot;idk&quot; for &quot;i dont know&quot;. This language is damaging how kids read and write. Although chat rooms on computer can be useful, they can do also be dangerous. Kids as well as adults go into chatrooms and talk to other people, saying invalid information about themselves. Such as age. Some adults go into chat rooms and pretend to be a teenager. They talk to kids until they find out something like an address, phone number, school, and district. Once they got information like that, they can find out many other things about kids. this is extremely dangerous and unfortunately, it does, and has happened. As you can see there are many advantages as well as disadvantages. I believe, if people can find a balance between them, people will agree more about computers. In my opinion computers are handy, but dangerous. If kids are more careful online, and spend more time outside than on the computer, there would be less controversy. Parents would be less concerned about their childs safety and health if kids only used computers for homework, and were safe about who they talk to online. Also, what kids say in profiles. If all of this happened, there would be a balance, and I think people would be less drasticly over a period of time, and people would be more comfortable.
8	Computers are an amazing technology to life. It'@CAPS1 amazing because the computer helps lots of people and jobs. The people it helps are kids in school to look up an area they need to find for a question on a worksheet. Also the jobs it helps us the police, @CAPS1.W.A.T and the @ORGANIZATION1. It helps the police and @CAPS1.W.A.T to find where people are and where they'll be. The @ORGANIZATION1 uses computers to locate where they will attack or defend. if it wasn't for computers we wouldn't of found @CAPS3 @CAPS4. The bad thing about computers are hackers and people that wont get off their computers. They are obssesed with the computer and they are so obssesed they sleep with the computer. That'@CAPS1 the parents fault. Those are the only bad things about computers. They get people fat an lazy because they only want to be on the computer. The computer also has good ways to reconnect with family and friends over the years you haven't seen them. The computer controlls lots of things like the nuclear bomb, security, secret-files, satalites, all of @CAPS5.A.@CAPS1.A. and more. They control life in the major part. People shouldn't be concerned about kids that sit there next to a computer all day because it'@CAPS1 the person'@CAPS1 fault, they ruined their lifes and the parent'@CAPS1 fault manly for not controlling their kid with staying away from the computer or the parents not signing them up for any sport. It ruines their life by having no friends at school an all they do is go straight for the computer. It'@CAPS1 an ashame to the father that use to be the cool kid, make fun of the nerds and get into fights every month. Then the father looks at his son an relises his son is a nerd and lives by a computer, then the father tryes to help the son and somewhat works out. Then the father keeps trying, thats good parenting to try to step it right when the child starts to go straight to the computer. Not the other parents that let their son/daughter only use the computer. Those are my opinions on computers of the good an bad ideas.
7	Dear Newspaper Computers have been a great learning source and i think it's time we give them some cridit insted of worrying over them. I will be telling you about how I think computers are great. One reason they are vary helpful is that books dont always have all of the information. So if you need to know a fact or need more information for a project you can go on the computer and it's all right there and you will have known more facts then when you started. The second reason is that you can be almost anywhere and half acess to a computer and you might not have a phone but you can talk or send a message. Not everyone has a phone but computers are a secondary way to have a conversation with someone. Another reason, is its not always sunny outside and when it is a rainy day you have a fun way to play and learn without having to be outside. The computer dosnt replace the outdores or exercising it is just a passtime when you dont have the oppertunity to be outside. I hope you liked and understod my reasons and will take them in to concideration when going over the topic.
10	Dear @ORGANIZATION1, Computers have a positive impact on people. Although people aren't outside being active, computers still benefit in a good way. Computers teach hand-eye coordination they're convient and you can interact online with diffrent types of people. Surely, computers teach hand-eye coordination. There are many website on the internet that teach kids to type. Typing helps kids learn the alphabet, learn what the letters look like and shows them where the keys are. Also, there are other sites where the computer interacts with you. Last, there are many kids even adults who have disiexing and get their letters jumbled, but there are softwares where when you type it will say what letter you have typed. Therefore computer teach hand-eye coordination. Have you ever been one of those students who write their papers, but get bad grades because their handwriting was messy? Using a computer is more convient and will make your due assignment as neat as ever. First, computer are convient because you have the answer to any question just at the click of button. Next, theres no need to spend money and go buy a book to look up research just research online for free. Finally, it is convinient for teachers and your employees, because if you need to send in a paper do it via-email. Getting a paper by email is much easier than getting it in pen with samples. Computer are convient in many ways. Computers allow people @NUM1 video chat and talk online. First, there are many families who have at least one member who lives in a different place. Computer allow families to see each other online. Without ever leaving their state. Next, there are other families who have a mom, dad, husband or wife in the army and haven't seen each other in person in years, but see each other on line. Lastly, there are many students and teachers who teach and learn online. This is easy for most people who have busy lives. Therefore you can interact online. As you can see computers have a positive effect. They teach hand eye coordination. They supply online chat, and are very convient. So next time you go to the library to research a book, stay at home do the same online.
8	I belive having computers in a household is a good idea. They can play games, learn, talk and many more. Here are my three reasons having a computer is a good thing. Having a computer is great to play games! There are so many varieties to choose from. There are card games, board games, even @NUM1 games! You can play solo, but it might be more fun and easyier to bring some friends along for the ride. As you can see having a computer can be fun, but its not the only thing to do on a computer. Useing a computer to learn is wonderful too. The computer can take you to places you have never seen, heard, or been to before, or maybe a place you couldn't afford to go. You @MONTH1 learn that in on place it's sunny all the time and in other places it's not. Another thing the computer can teach you is about animals. Animals have been here way be for us. There is still much we dont know about them. Many scientists have spent their lives studying animal and have put it on the iternet for you to better educate yourself. The computer can also teach you hand-eye. Hand-eye is great to have if your trying out for a sport like football, baseball, and basketball. Also you never know when you'll need to catch somthing. My final reason is also very helpful. Being able to talk on the computer is good to using voice chat or instint messenger is your choice. While talking on the computer you might make some new friends that share the same intrests and hobbies you do. And you can chat with them as long as there online. Also while your talking you can express your ideas and feelings. Somtimes you might just need to blow off some steam. Or maybe post an idea that can one day be famous. As you can see games, learning and talking are easier to do on the computer. This is why I think.
2	Dear editor, computers are good for people because it really helps with they work and home work and other stuff.
9	Dear Local Newspaper, Are you spending all your precious time on a computer? On the computer your probably wasting every second searching or playing games. You shoudn't spend alot of time on the computer it will just wash away your brain. You shoudn't go on computers for a long time because instead you should be exercising, enjoying nature and interacting with people. First of all, spending too much time on the computer is not good for you because you should be out exercising. On computers you can't jog the fat you gain by eating food. By jogging instead of going on the computer you can lose weight and see the real world than the world behind the computer screen. Nevertheless computers are fun to go on like playing addicting games. but isn't it better to play a real sport like soccer. In soccer you have to use your mind and alot so it is much better than sitting or laying around dazed at a computer screen for a long period of time. Don't you love playing outdoor games! Like playing tag or hiding go seek isn't that more fun than playing an addicting game on the computer screen? For me I think it is. That is my reasons I think you should exercise then stare at the computer screen. Secondly, you shouldn't be on the computer for a long amount of time because you should instead be enjoying nature. Nature is beautiful and refreshing unlike a computer. Yeah I know computers offer alot but do they offer the fresh air outside, the warm breeze land living animals the earth. I don't think so and neither should you. Instead of going on your computer when it is raining not you should play with your pets and if you don't have any put a raincoat umbrella and go outside. Especially in the @DATE1 you should be outside enjoying nature go for a swim or bring your annoying little siblings to the park. There is more to often in use than going on the computer. More importantly, you shouldn't go on the computer because you are better off. Interacting with living people in person. On the computer talking to people you are going no where on the computer chatting with people it is impossible to read someones expression. So get off the computer and hang with your family and friends. Get into a fun conversation or debate. Make new friends when your at the mall or discovering a new trail in a park. Do anything but interact on the computer when all you see is typed words writing back to you. Get your self out in the world don't just interact with people but the world not the computer screen. In conclusion you shouldn't spend most of your precious time on the computer. It isn't nessasary for you to spend all your time on the computer when you could be exrcising, enjoying nature and interacting with people. I strongly beleive people should be outside than on a computer. So what are you waiting for get off that computer and take a hike!
10	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4, The average teenager spends @NUM1 hours on a computer daily! People spend too much time on their computers. They don't exercise as much nowadays. Also, they don't enjoy all the wonderful nature the has to offer. Most importantly, people who spend too much time on the computer don't see their family and friends. These are the reasons why people shouldn't spend so much of their time on a computer. Since people spend too much time on the computer, the exercise less and less. A recent poll shwos that @NUM2 in every @NUM3 @CAPS5 is overweight. If our modern society didn't have so many distractions like computers than maybe people would be bore &amp; maybe fo outside. Back in @DATE5 only @PERCENT2 of the @CAPS6 population was obese. So, why in @DATE6 has this number skyrocketted to @PERCENT1? Back then electronics weren't popular so for fun, kids played games with eachother outside on a regular basis. Now it's rare for a kids to be motivated to put down the mouse, and go play kickball with neighborhood) friends. The kids would rather sit inside a airconditioned hoose thatn go outside &amp; have some good healthy fun &amp; work up a sweat. Computers keep people from exercising so their affect on people is negative. With computers being so popular, people are less involved with nature. Our society doesn't take the time to notice the cool breeze on an @DATE4 @TIME1, or the waves crashing on a hot @DATE3 @TIME1. They don't take time to appreciate has beautiful the follage is in @DATE2, or now it feels to be showered with snow on a chilly @DATE1 @TIME1. People would rather sit at a computer for @NUM4 hours doing wonders of our world. People don't respect the natural beauties that nature has to offer. Computers take away from people enjoying nature's joy. Computers run people's relationships with family and friend. @NUM5 year old @CAPS7 would rather talk to his girlfriend on the computer than spen time with this @CAPS8. Kids don't organize their priorities we enough. as it is, adding a computer into the mix just makes it worse. Peple have accounts on social networking sites like facebook and sometimes they are very drame filled and cause problems. Friendships are easily ruined and usually the cause of this is some kind of misunderstanding. It is very sad but true that kids would rather watch goofy vidoes than visit a grandparent. Computers are negative to people since they ruin their relationships with friends and family. People should spend less time on the computer. Computers are a main factor in the vast increase in obesity rates. Kids need to regain healthyness before it's too late! Also, people of all ages should realize the natural beauty of naturel, but computers get in the way of that. Most importantly, computers ruin many relationships with friends and family. The cause stress and unnecessary drama. As you can see, computer have a negative affect on people.
10	When your were a kid, did your parents let you play all day on the computer? Well my parents don't let me and I think thats not fair. I think it's not fair because being on the computer has a lot of benefits, like teaching you hand-eye cordination. Another advantage is that when your on the computer you can chat with people through webcams. Also with a computer you can do homework assignments for something that requires you to do research. And of course when your on a computer, you can watch your favorite movie or t.v show, like @CAPS1 @CAPS2 or @CAPS3 @CAPS4. Now aren't these some great advantages? As an adult @CAPS5 pretty sure that you like to do a lot of things from the comfort of your own home, well when you have a computer you can. One way you can keep in touch is by online chatting like through the webcam or my favorite @CAPS6 which stands for aol instant messaging. Surprisingly, another thing you can do is work online by setting it up at work or telling your boss how to do it. By the way your an adult who didn't go to college when you were @NUM1 because you had to work well. If you have a computer or laptop you can go to school online and the best thing is that you'll be in your bed nice and warm without any worries. Now don't you thinkg that is a nice way to spend your @DATE1 @TIME1? When your a kid my age when you have a computer all you want to do is play games online with friends. Well that is what must of us kids do nowadays but our parents don't let us play to much. The only time they let us stay long is when we maybe doing a project for school. But when your a kid besides playing games all day, we also want to learn about things like @LOCATION1 or the @CAPS7 @CAPS8 that's what you. Most people would agree that when you have a computer you can just book a hotel online of going all the way to the hotel. Of course that what my parents do, everytime a vacation they look everything online like the hotel, the, and the. yes having a computer is helpful. Another thing you can do is watch movies online when you are on a plane going to the vacation, because that's what I do with my laptop. But the thing I like the most is watching shows because everytime I watch different episodes of @CAPS9 @PERSON1 the time goes by so quick that a @NUM2 hour flight only seems like @NUM3 hours. Finally, I have explained to you why having a computer is a good thing. One reason is because you can do a lot of things on the computer itself. A second reason is that you can do alot of school work with it like doing a research paper or going to school online. And my final reason was that you can book things online without going anywhere, wasting gas. So now it's your turn to decide whether having a computer is a good thing or a bad thing.
8	Dear local newspaper @CAPS1 I think that kid's should be alowed to go on here computers. So they can talk to there relitives across. The @CAPS5 @CAPS2 they want to. I have family members in @LOCATION1. I talk to them evry day because I have a laptop and they say that. I have relitives in @LOCATION3 I belive them because I have there email. They told me about my mother living in @LOCATION2. So I asked her she seaid yes that is true and I looked up were my mom lived. Thanks to computer also I learned that @LOCATION3 has one of the @CAPS3 @CAPS4 in The @CAPS5. So I asked my mom @CAPS2 I can go to @LOCATION3 she said yes. So I went with my sister and we even visited are family members and the @CAPS6 point I can tell you it looked exacly how. I pichered very tall coverd with trees. Birds @CAPS7, scwerwels climing trees the thing, that surprised me the most was there was a house on top of the mountine. For sale I wished that my mom was thier because she will love it. So ever time we go down there we rent that house thanks to the computers. Lastly you can even look up people on the internet. I herd that criss rock almost died. So when I got home I went on my laptop and looked it up so I did and it said nothing about. That but it did say one thing that surprised me. The most it seaid that he was geting a divorce. From his wife I think the peorson how said. That he almost died most of missed read it. So now I look up all my fraverit people. Thanks to computers the time is now to accet @CAPS2 people should have computers to use to lern about the @CAPS5 or just think what everyone sayes. So I hope you make a good chouse. But befor you choose think about it.
8	Dear, @ORGANIZATION1 the big rectangular shaped black or white box with lights and beeps, the compter was a smart idea,! But why do you ask,? i'll show you. This device can teach you a new language, skype can let you talk to @CAPS1 on the web or on phone!, (but you still have to pay @MONEY1.) you can surf the web or have a laugh on youtube, who needs to go out and buy stuff when on ebay or amazon just order and your done, (but you still have to wait.) why go to blockbuster to rent movies when you can go on netflix and order a movie and keep it for as long as you like, no late fees, no driving all the way to the movie store, no more of that please!. Next lets go back to the web, @CAPS2 you own a @CAPS3 or a built in camera on your laptop or netbook, you can video chat with @CAPS1 and family across the globe!, @CAPS2 you'r the kind of person that like video games then boy you will love this!, @CAPS5 ~~@CAPS6's can download games such as sim's, spore, etc. then you will love the @CAPS6. MACs also share good stuff such as the finder, safari, dashboard, etc, so thats all i have to say about @CAPS8. And now you are probably asking which computer should i get?, @CAPS9 @CAPS12 friend's at @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 you have the abillty to choose either @CAPS8 or @CAPS6, but it's not @CAPS12 disision to pick out your computer, it's yours so go out and create an investment for a computer today!. but im not finished yet you can also pick a laptop, a desktop, or a netbook I can tell about all of them and I will, a laptop is good @CAPS2 your on the go a lot and @CAPS2 your in the office or you have a lot of business trips its a good idea th have a laptop at hand,. a desktop is good @CAPS2 your home a lot and work is oniline on the web or just llike the comfort of home than a desktop is right for you!, and last but not least, the netbook, it's good @CAPS2 your on the go a lot especialy when yory on vacation, and it fits nicely on your lap or on a table or @CAPS2 you dont want to get up to use the computer just grab your netbook and your ready to go, I almost forgot all netbooks come with a built in @CAPS3 so @CAPS2 your on vacation and you dont have a phone or computer just go on your netbook and there you go. well thats all I have to say thanks for reading 
5	Dear Newspaper writers, I belev that difrent web sites have difrent effeks on people. For exam pull @ORGANIZATION1 has news about what is going on in the world. Other websites all difrent types of games on it could be bad for some people because some of the games are not vary apropreit. Most edicatinal web sites are ment fo help people learn. One person can learn so much with a computer. You can buy and sell a iturn that you own an get many all on one web site. A computer can be used for many difrent perpests.
10	Computers are one of the best advances in technology ever made. Not only are computers fun but they're also very beneficial to society. First off, comptuers are great way to communicate with other people whether it's instant-messageing, email, video-messaging, or services like @ORGANIZATION1. @DATE1, Computers offer many learning opportunities. There are thousands or websites with information about your search whether it be about simple things like how to bake cookies or even more complex searches like how many stars are in the sky. Last but not least, computers just simply make life easier by helping you with everday needs. To begin, computers are a great source of communication. I remember a time when my father traveled to @LOCATION1 on business. Because it costs so much money to pay for international cellphone service, my dad could not call using his cell phone. Instead, my father called using @ORGANIZATION1. It was great because it was right on the computer. Besides making live communication easier, computers also help to communicate news, weather few weeks ago, the the home was out. It was to shout the @DATE1, so my family had no way to. Since are than our cable provider, we were able to look up. School was indeed our computer, we world. Plus, computers offer more learning opportunities. Aside from being a great source of communication, computers are fantastic for searching and research. For almost all of my school assignments that required research, I've used a computer. Sometimes, you can even find articles from library books online. Some people say that the library is always the best place to find information but I disagree. More than half the time, the internet has beyond enough information for what I need. Studies show that @NUM1 out of @NUM2 people say that computers answered their question better than any library book, did. Also, computers make life a whole lot easier. Computers make life so much easier. From typing to research to communicating and even to making travel arangements, computers help to make everday chores a lot easier. When my cousing was in highschool, she was assigned a @NUM3 word essay for homework. First off, it's pain having to count everyword and also, most importantly it's no fun having to write that much so my cousin decide to just type it. It saves time and is way neater. She finish her typed essay in @NUM4 hour while love friend finished in an @NUM4 @NUM4/2 hours because she hand wrote it. Its you on computers are esier. To conclude, computers are beneficial because they're a great source of communication, they offer many learning opportunities, and they make life so much easier. Thank you for reading, and I hope I've persuaded you to agree with my position that computers are one of the best advances in technology ever accomplished and why they are so beneficial to society.
6	I think computers help people out because you can learn about at here thing like @CAPS1 you want a job you can look it up in the computers. Also @CAPS1 you have a problem they will help you out. @CAPS1 you what to go some where you could go and be on the computer and look how it is and @CAPS1 you like it you could go @CAPS1 not look some where else you what to go. I think it a great thing @CAPS1 you look for people in the computer because you could talk to them and see them it realy cool. You can look for coltures in your computer what you want to learn. Like @CAPS1 you have a favert person you what to know about you can look it up in the computer and she videos or you can look up different sites it really cool. There games you can play online there alot of game and fun game learning games. Math game science game different games you what. Also you can us othere people that are planing the game game as you. It realy cool. I think the computer isn't bad for people computer help them a lot.
8	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I agree that computers do have a positive effect on people. I agree, because being on the computer teaches you hand-eye coordination, helps people learn about faraway places and people, and allows people to talk to other people. By being on the computer it helps teach people hand-eye coordination. So the computer help with hand- eye coordination by using the mouse and keyboard. For example, when you use a computer you dont need to look at your hands while you use the mouse. That helps with hand-eye coordination, because you can see where your hand is without looking. Another example is the keyboard, because while learning where all the keys are you memorize them. Then soon you can type with without looking. The computer also helps you to learn. When you go on the computer the thing people go on is the internet. On the internet people can find information about faraway places or people. So, because the computer has different links and websites, it helps kids and adults everywhere to get information fast. Without the computer everyone would have to go to a library, but what if they didnt have the right information? Then you would need to trace around everywhere to find a book. Thats why a computer is handy. Also, the computer allows people to stay in touch with others farther away. One example of this is that there are chat rooms or groups people can join. So, if a relative or friend is farther away from a more or if they are down the street, with chat rooms it makes talking easier. Also, by these chat rooms and groups it makes a lot of people happy knowing that they can still talk with an old friend or relative instead of loosing them from never seeing or talking to them. That is just another example why the computer has a positive effect. So, with the examples of the computer helping teach hand-eye coordination, makes obtaining information easier and of the many reasons and examples of the computer having a positive effect.
7	Dear local Newspaper, Computers don't take exercising, enjoying nature, and no interacting with friends and family away from you. Your family can sey time limits on the computer if they think your. Spending to much time on it. If you have time limits then people will have a certin time they go on and off of the computer. For example a child is on the computer @NUM1 and you can't get them off, time limits will stop that. The child is on a game and if the time limits are on, when your time is done the computer logs off automaticaly. That way your child can't get back on till thier next time. The computer can do many things you can play online games and chat with friends. Chating will let you talk to friends over the computer and you won't need to call them. Online games will still let you talk to your friends but you can have an avatar you can dress up and be creative with. For example an online game can let you chat make friends,
8	@CAPS1. The computer is a wonderful thing! However the effects it has on people can be bad. Think of it this way, it has magnetic forces that pull people to it and keep them @CAPS3 for hours. These magnetic forces keep people from exercising, stops them from spending time with family and friends and most importantly if they aren't being careful they can get into some cyber danger. I spoke with the @CAPS2 of @PERSON2 and he said @CAPS3 are so many people on their computers, people aren't getting enough exercise!&quot; @CAPS4 people dont get enough exercise their bodies expand and become obese. This happens a lot to average people. The @CAPS2 and I thought up some great ideas while I was @CAPS3 and we think for one week in @DATE1 we are going to live without any electricity! Computers are very use-full, they help spread important information around fast and make it easy to talk to friends and family. Even though you are talking to them you are not learning any new social skills. Typing on the computer is a lot different from talking in person. Usually you would type &quot;u&quot; instead of &quot;you&quot; or &quot;r&quot; instead of &quot;are&quot;. Talking over the computer is great!&quot; says @PERSON1, &quot;But actually seeing my family and talking talking to them is way better.&quot; @CAPS6, @CAPS7, @CAPS8, and way more sights websites can put you in cyber danger! Cyber danger is @CAPS4 you get in trouble on the computer. This can happen @CAPS4 you put up bad pictures of yourself or other people, @CAPS4 you talk to someone you have never met before, or you say something really mean to that girl you don't like. Those situations can all put you in a really tough place. Even if you have a webpage and you put it on private @CAPS3 is always a way to get in. @CAPS3 is also something called cyber bullying. Cyber bullying is @CAPS4 you get bullyed or are bullying another person over the computer. Don't think that no one will know @CAPS3 are ways to track down coversations between people. I really hope you all take this into account @CAPS4 you think about sitting at your computer! Go outside, spend time with your family and friends, and be careful from cyber danger! &quot;@NUM1&quot; bye!&quot;
8	Alot of people would disagree that computers are benefiting people. But I think that computers are exremely helpful because they are a good way to learn, they are fun to use, and it's also a goodway to talk to old friends. I know there are some people who are on computers alot more than they should but still computers are very helpful. Computers are a very good way to learn because on a computer you could easily find out whi the @CAPS1 of @LOCATION1 is. But if you didn't use a computer and you went to a library it could take hours to find the right and find were in the book it is. You could also learn about news faster without writing for it to come on the news channel. Computers are a lot beter than having to drive to a library because with just a couple as clicks you could find what you want and be done. Computers are also fun because you can play little games on the internet that could easily take up on extra @NUM1 minutes that yu might have on a work break or before school. And even some games exercise your mind like solitare its fun but hard. But there are some games that people tend to over do because they go addicted. But most people haven't ever prayed a game like that or only play once in a while. Lastly computers are a good way to stay in touch with old friends because there are a lot of ways to talk to people online like say if when you were in high school your best friends moved away you sould still talk to people on a chat room were you can text. or a video chat were you actualy see them face to face. In conclusion I think computers are helpful because you can learn, play and talk to people. Computers are best all around helpful.
8	Dear @CAPS1 local @CAPS2, I think that computers are on positive effect on people. @CAPS6 you think that there positive on people? Well I'll give you @NUM1 reasons why you should say &quot;@CAPS8&quot; @NUM2) teaches hand-eye coordination @NUM3) abiliy to learn and get your @CAPS3 online @NUM1) you can talk to people all of the world. These are @CAPS1 @NUM1 reasons. @CAPS1 first reason is hand-eye coordination. If you have hand-eye coordination, you can @CAPS6 anything. This can help you get a job and even help with a sport you like. Having hand-eye coordination is important because were in @DATE1 everything goes around by computer and cell phones. This is @CAPS1 first reason. @CAPS1 second reason, how the computer can teach people things. The internet has a lot of web sites about how to get your @CAPS3 online. And you can take online classes. There is a @PERCENT1 drop-out rate and @PERCENT2 of those kid don't have there @CAPS3, so they go online to take there classes. The computer can really help you. This is @CAPS1 second reason. Finally, people go online to chat rooms to talk and met new people. Meeting new people is a good thing to @CAPS6. You can learn about where and how the person lives. Chats rooms are cool to. You can go online and talk to your friends without wasteding your phone minutes. The computer can help in many ways. @CAPS1 last reason. OK, I'm done but @CAPS6 you remember that question I asked you? (@CAPS6 you the computers are a positive effect on people?) @CAPS7 @CAPS6 you think? I hope you say &quot; @CAPS8, they are an positive effect &quot;. But any ways those are @CAPS1 @NUM1 reasons why. P.S. I hope you go out and buy a computer after reading this!! 
10	Dear @LOCATION1, @CAPS1 everybody relizes, technology is getting more advanced every single day. That is a good thing and could help people with everyday problems like @CAPS19, getting an answer to a problem, and @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS2 work. The more advanced Computers become, the more advanced People are. To start, Computers can help People comunicate just imagine someone on the other side of the world. you can use websites like @CAPS3 and e-mail to quickly comunicate with typing. I @CAPS4 like @ORGANIZATION2 can quickley send live videos of yourself all the way across the world . Without these technologies, we would never see each others faces and we would only be useung telephones. with @CAPS5 book, you can also @CAPS6 @CAPS7 like never before. Have you ever been in the situation when you can'@CAPS15 @CAPS6 @CAPS7? well I have @CAPS7 can be easily uploaded in a matter of minutes. It used to be that @CAPS10 traveled very slowly, @CAPS8, we can know about it only a few minutes after it happened, thanks to computers. Computers can relay information at practily the speed of light. It is also a lot easier to find the @CAPS10. You only need to @CAPS9 the mouse a few @CAPS18 and you find the biggest resivior of @CAPS10 ever. Their is international @CAPS10, @CAPS11 @CAPS10, and much more in the palm of your hand. @CAPS10 also travels @CAPS12 on the internet then on @CAPS10 @CAPS14 or @CAPS15.V. Their are also on line @CAPS10 @CAPS14 like the @CAPS16 @CAPS17 @CAPS18 and magazines like time. Have you ever felt sick, and you didn'@CAPS15 want to leave your house? Well how you ran do all your @CAPS19 on line. Their is no more going to a store to buy furniture or clothes you can just log on to a computer and have almost every store on your finger tips. Buy a whole @CAPS16 @CAPS20, a @CAPS16 couch, and even your groceries in only ten minutes. You can even shop for houses or cars online. @CAPS19 on the internet has truly changed the world in more ways the anyone could have belived fifteen years ago. To @CAPS21, computers have made life easier for almost every person who has one. @CAPS1 Computers get smarter, maybe they can also do incredible things like work for us and automaticly buy something for us if we are running out of @CAPS22. The @CAPS23 are endless.
8	Dear local newspaper, I have heard about this issue concerning people are on their computer to much. In my opinion, i think that people should not spend so much time on the computer for several reasons. There are the reasons to why I think that people should less time on the internet, and more outdoors. One reason to why I think that people should spend less time on the computer and more times outdoors is so that they can get more exercise. When you get exercise you can lose weight. You can also feel lighter and better about yourself, you will be more active. Another reason to why you should spend more time outdoors than on the computer is because if you don't you will get very very very lazy. If you don't get out and play or exercise, you will become tired. Also, you will become cranky and want do what your parents tell you to do because your mind will be so into your computer screen. My last but not least reason to why we should spend more time outdoors than indoors on the computer is because we can miss out on family fun that goes on. Since people are on the computer so much they miss out an parties and social events. They @MONTH1 also miss out on family dinners and movie night. If you do not want to miss out on the fun, I suggest that you get cuclasses more and stop being a lazy couch potato. As you cansee, there are many reasons to why we should spend more time outdoors doing activities such as going on a bike side, going kout to eat, as even a nice stroll along the heart while walking the dog. I really hope that my opinions means something to you. And I also hope you agree with me. Thank you for your time.
12	@ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1 not advance in technology?&quot; asks four year old @PERSON2. There are countless reasons, people are spending way too much time on the technology we have already such as the computer. @CAPS9 of wasting time on this device, people arent excersicing, enjoying nature, and spending quality time with their friends and family. When you are on the computer for one hour, how many calories do you think you're burning? According to a study done at @ORGANIZATION2, one of the best colleges in the world, you're only burning @NUM1 calories. To maintain a healthy weight, you must burn at least @NUM1,000 calories a day! The average citizen in @LOCATION2, @LOCATION1 spends @NUM3 hours on the computer so that's @NUM4 calories. Even if they did aerobic excersize for the rest of the day, they couldn't burn enough calories @CAPS9 you can only burn @NUM5 calories an hour at the average aerobics class. If people can't maintain a healthy weight, they became obese, if they are obese they can get heart attacks, and if they have a heart attack, they could die! @PERCENT2 of the obese population in the @LOCATION4 die from a heart attack. With out a doubt, computers are like poison, if you use it, you'll get sick - but if you use to much, you'll die. Imagine - birds chirping up in the trees, deer sipping water out of a nice cold pond. In the distance, a fox playfully chases a butterfly. If you are in @PERCENT2 of @CAPS2 who have actually seen something like this with your own eyes you're lucky. &quot;@CAPS3 fellow @CAPS2, I painfully state this fact. The rainforest in @LOCATION3 is being cutdown as we speak. This is @CAPS9 the @CAPS5 never go out and smell fresh air &amp; see how beautiful the rainforest really is. We must stop them!&quot; pleads former @CAPS6 @PERSON3 in an internationally televised speach. Too bad only @NUM6 out of every @NUM7 @CAPS2 could relate to kid message. @PERCENT3 of @CAPS2 have never gone out into nature. @CAPS9 of this, people are saying who cares about nature &amp; the rain forest? &quot;@CAPS9 of this, the rainforest is mercilessly being destroyed and animals are loosing their homes. When a pool was given to the @PERCENT3 of people who don't ever go outside to ejoy nature @PERCENT1 of them responded that it was @CAPS9 they are too busy spending time on the computer. The computer is a monster - it's killing our planet.&quot; I love @CAPS3 mommy. I @CAPS10 her everyday before dinner,&quot; sadly states eight year old, @PERSON1. Using computers kills time that could be spent with your loved ones, even if you are communicating with them on the computer. A @NUM5 year old cancer patient, @ORGANIZATION3 was on his death bed what he wished that he could change about his life, he answerd, &quot;I wish that I didn't use the computers as much I got to know @CAPS3 family &amp; friends better! @ORGANIZATION3 died lates that day. Do you want to carry around that heavy of a burden with you until your death? No, you don't. In a drug rehab the @ORGANIZATION4 asked the patients @CAPS1 they started drugs in the first in the first place, @PERCENT4 answered that it was @CAPS9 they didn't feel love by their families. After they answered, they were asked @CAPS1 they didn't feel love, @PERCENT5 of them answered @CAPS9 the people that they love were to busy on the computers. Unless you want to put one of your love ones' in the hospital do not use the computers. Obviously, computers are aweful technological devices. Yes, they do help with coordination, but would you rather be fast, not enjoy family &amp; nature, but be able to catch a ball or be healthy, loved, and loving?&quot;
6	Computers are very helpful in many of ways. I believe that computers can a very great needed affect on you. @CAPS5 can cause you to @CAPS1, @CAPS2 and cheap @CAPS3. The computer can @CAPS1 you in many interesting ways. The fast wat @CAPS5 can @CAPS1 is @CAPS4 helping other plan @CAPS4 vacations by money to them. Also @CAPS5 can @CAPS1 by know how to do diffrent things like @CAPS6 if you get lost or show you how to get there. The second way is helps is to give @CAPS2. The computer can give you plenty of @CAPS2. I use the computer @CAPS4 @CAPS2 @CAPS7 of . @CAPS5 also gives me @CAPS2 about a @CAPS8 college that I would @CAPS9 and like to attend to. The last way the computer helps out the its with box from there. If you @CAPS10 online you can in the computer. I @CAPS9 this machine because you don't have to buy something that just come out @CAPS4 the real expensive @CAPS12 you can just @CAPS10 online and @CAPS11 @CAPS5 @CAPS4 a cheaper @CAPS12. Also @CAPS13 mom wanter to @CAPS11 new @CAPS15 on the dealer but @CAPS5 was expensive so went online and bought @CAPS5 cheaPer than the would sell @CAPS5 to us. This is how the computer can come in handy when you need @CAPS5. This is why I believe that computer you.
7	Dear, Local @ORGANIZATION1 paper I do think that computers benefit society, because if a student needs to write a report europe their going to weell. A computer to give the quier accesible information is do there project at home. Computers are great ways to meet people online so that you stay social and not. They also teach hand-eye-cordination. So you eyes are beter their seeing nothing. I also think computer benifits society because it could get student motivated in passing there test or passing the school year and getting the to use it. Computers are also a great of knowledge and can get kids to be better on a subject like history, or science, you should agree with me because local @ORGANIZATION1 papers got there information off the internet sometimes and with our computers @ORGANIZATION1 would be slow and. Computers also have positive effects on people because it teaches them the dangers of things and they could be more and, and computers give finger strongly gripto be a lot faster, and computers are the fastes way to know about the @ORGANIZATION1 or about the wether, like if there wits going to be a snow storm you could check if you got school.
10	Dear local newspaper, Computers are they a good benifit for society or a bad benifit for society? What do you think would you enjoy always being on the computer? I wouldn't, so this is why I believe that computers have a negative impact on society. First reason why I think computers have a negative impact is because you can become addicted to always having to be on the computer. Becoming addicted to the computer leads to serious consequences. For example you spend less time exercising and that isn't healthy for your body physically. Not exercising leads to many things like being over weight, health problems, diseases like dieabeties, and many other things, but usually these are the main problems. You can aviode this by turning of the computer and just go for a small walk, but because of what computers have to offer now these day people want do this. Thats one reason why computers have a negative impact on the society. Another reason for why computers have a negative impact on society is because you won't spend as much time with your friends and family. Even if you don't know this if you spend more time on the computer than with your family and friends this affects them in many ways. They can feel dissapointed worried about you, even concerned. When you are always on the computer you're ignoring your family and this hurts them emotionally. Think about how would you feel if you had a best friend you always hung out with. You two did everthing together, and the all of a sudden your best friend suddenly stops calling you; or visiting you and hanging out with you. You would feel dissapointed because you loss your best friend over a computer. These things can happen if you go overboard when using the computer. This is why is think computers don't do good they do more harm in my personal opinion. The final reason why I say that computers aren't way good is for a main reason safty. Those days computers have all the websites like @CAPS1, @CAPS2, twitter, and others. There are so many kids who chat with people they don't even know. Also they're posting pictures of themselves without even thinking that this is a dangerous thing to do. Once you post those pictures they will always be there no matter if you even try to delete them. Another thing when you're on the computer people don't even think about their safty and thats how things happen. For example you can think you're talking to a friend but as it turns out you were talking to some stranger. Then you go meet up with your friend when it really wasn't. So you see safty is a real big problem with these computers. That's why I believe computers have a really negative impact on society. As a result, do you still believe that computers are a good beifit for society or bad beifit? My opinion stillis the same and I'm sure that there are others who believe the same. So this is why I think that computers are a bad benifit for society, and that computers can lead to more harm than do any good for people who use the computer.
10	Dear Local Newspaper, Have you ever thought about how computers effect human beings? The impacts? The results? The education? I believe that computers have a positive effect on people. Computers allow people to talk with others online, have the ability to educate in certain areas, and teach hand-eye coordination. Who says the only way to contact or communicate with someone is through letters or the phone? The technology brought upon using computers allows people to talk online with others in a fast, easy, enjoyable way. Have a question that you have to ask a friend, but someone else is using the phone? Write a letter! Oh wait, letters can take up todays and your question is urgent! The computer is an easy alternative for communication. Say you're an amazing singer with a beautiful voice and you want to find an agent more than anything. Computers are so advanced in technology that they can find you an agent in no time. E-mail, websites, @CAPS1, and more, are all ways you can contact that agent. Computers are a great way to communicate. The mind is an extrordinary thing. It can be filled with knowledge, and still have the ability to learn and understand more. Reading books is a fantastic way to learn, but the internet has so much more to offer and you are not only reading from one great author, but tons of great authors. The computer allows you to learn about far away places and important people without making that trip to the library. Have you ever heard of online colleges? They are advertised on @CAPS2.V. all the time. Some people @MONTH1 think that learning from home, laying in bed with a laptop placed in front of them is a distractive way to learn. But what about being comfortable and not intiminated by anyone else around you? Computers can help you get your college degree in a comfortable environment. Hand-eye coordinatin is an excellet and wonderful thing to have. Along with videogames, computer games teach you exactly that. Parents @MONTH1 think we kids are wasting our time playing games on the computer, but we are actually challenging our minds and our hand-eye coordinatin ability. Computers are key when it comes to pysicological learing. Handeye coordinatin is taught to us through games and such that we play without us even knowing it. Hand-eye coordination allows us to catch a ball or play sports, and computers help us acheive that.
9	@ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1 studies have been conducted over the past few years, and they show that people of all ages spend @PERCENT1 of their free time on the computers. This is becoming a problem all over our state and country. Computers are consuming the lives of everyone. An anonymous source claims that they use their computer to contact old friends. A study shows that phone usage has gone down because adults and teens would prefer to email or instant message a friend. This results in sitting in front of a computer screen waiting for a responce. @PERSON1, a student at @ORGANIZATION2 says, I go on the computer once or twice a week. i dont use it all that much because I'd rather be out having fun with all my friends rather than be holed up in a room by myself.&quot; @CAPS2 people believe it is a way to be more social, but it really isn't. It's just sitting in front of a screen talking to people you @MONTH1 not even know too well. When you sit down in your computer chair and start e-mailing away, you aren't doing any physical exercise. The @CAPS2 movement people will normally do is get up and go to the bathroom. Then they are right back in a chair, making minimal movements. @PERCENT2 of people who sit in front of a computer end up obese because they don't burn any calories. Since they don't relesase many endorphins, so they aren't very happy. If they got up and went outdoors to do physical exercise, they would be fit and happy . Often, teenagers feel more powerful when they are using a computer. They find it easier to disobey rules their parents set for them. Teens also find it easier to bully other children via the internet or social networks. @NUM1 out of @NUM2 students at @ORGANIZATION2 middle @ORGANIZATION2 confess to being the target of malicious bullying online. @NUM3 out of @NUM2 confess to be bullied, and they definitely don't want to be bullied on facebook or myspace where everything is out on your profile for your peers to see. Teens should have limited time on the computer, so they don't do anything they will regret in their future. Therefore, adults and teens should be aware that using a computer is fine, but they shouldn't over use the luxury of a way to find information quickly or contact a friend in a foreign country. This generation needs to be reminded that their whole life shouldn't be spent on the computer. Probably less than @NUM5 minutes a day should be spent checking your e-mail or instant messaging a friend. Then you should go outdoors and spend time with your friends and family.&quot;
10	@ORGANIZATION1, With the recent development @MONEY1 technology in todays society I know that there is a lot @MONEY1 controversy with computers. Many people believe that computers are positive towards our society. While others disagree. I feel that technology can be both good and bad. Technology provides great advancements in our world. But people experience less @MONEY1 the outside world when they surround themselves with technology. But I feel that we can find a balance between the two views. Having computers has brought a lot @MONEY1 advancement in todays society. Look at modern medicine, it would be nothing without todays technology in computers. We can look at todays military. Computers practically run todays armed forces. But who knows where technology can take us. Our society could continue to greatly advance with the help @MONEY1 computers. But then again we could all wonder where would we be today without computers. So @ORGANIZATION1, as you can see computers have helped our society greatly with improvement and progression. But with all @MONEY1 this technology we still need to find a balance. It is live todays @CAPS1 spend cover @NUM1 hours per week on computers. People are not experiencing the world outside @MONEY1 their computers. Our state does put in @MONEY1 each year for our parks just so we can ignore them. Also with increased computer time people are not getting outside. They arenâ€™t getting proper exercise. You @MONTH1 even notice that if you use the computer too much you will miss more interactions with your family. So although computers can be very useful you need to be able to turn off the computer and realize the true important things in your life, besides the computers. computers can be both good and bad. But I think that we need to find a balance between the two. Computers are useful to our daily life but at the same time we also need to realize that we need to sometimes take a break from our computers. Lets face it without computers today we would not be able to function. Entire companies revolve around computers and if computers just ended, @MONEY1 @MONEY1 people would lose their jobs. But also regular people, for example teens, do not need to be on the computer for four hours a day. Those four hours could be spent with their families. We need to find a balance. For example, you could say for every hour your on the computer you need to spend that same hour to go outside, spend time with your family, etc. Computers are useful but we cannot over use it. So, to the @ORGANIZATION1, computers help our society thrive. But at the same time we need to learn when we have had enough time on the computer. So I believe that we can call find a healthy balance @MONEY1 computer use.
9	Dear local news paper, Computers are powerful machines in our world. Most people east, sleep, and drink computer. Thats when those people are forty and live with there mom, for the most part of computer are used by teenagers and buiness workers. Computers are a tool that need to be used in an everyday life. We all know and remembe when we were &quot;sick&quot; just so we could go to the office with mom or dad to draw pictures and spin in the office chairs. Well while we were busy playing mom and dad were busy as well. They talked to their boss, made copies, had meetings drank coffee, and most of all they spent half of the day doing work on the computer. It could of been making spread sheet, designing logos, editing someones or getting new clients. About ninety percent of the workers use the computer to do their jobs. they need to be senting work to other companies over sea's or just down one float. Computers need to be used to do most jobs in @LOCATION1. Also the computers in today's time are beautiful because they have the internet. The internet allows use to talk to people around the world and look things up like the news, the close bridle shop, the biggest shopping mall, biggest race car tract near you and pizza placer near you. The inernet can let you do many things. I know that hear in granby you have to but the newspaper, but instead of but the paper you can just go on you computer and chechk the news. Look up the weather, the celebrity gossip, and where the plance crashed that you mom told you about. The computer can give you great information but only if you know how to use it. One thing that I find great is that you can watch tv. and movies right from your computer. Then you don't need to buy all those high priced chanles to watch movies. You can see you favorite shows and moves. A big thing is that teenagers span a majority of there time on facebook, twitter or myspace. Some of the advantages you get from these online sites is that you can chat with an old friend and show them a picture of you and your family. You can let people know what you are doing or tell them you sad because your dog died. You just can use the internet for just about anything. Lastly something you can do is buy music on the computers. You don't need to go out and spend @MONEY1 on an album, you can now just buy a single song for a dollar. You can buy many things on the internet the clothes on food. Thats why the computer
8	My opinion is that the more that we stay on the computer. The more we get lazy. One reason that I say this is because, a computer is a big handy person in reality. Second reason is, people stay in the house sitting down on the computer other than exercising. The third reason is, people just sit in the house, and an't enjoy fresh air with their loved ones. First, the reason why I say a computer is a big handy person because it does most of the things a human can do. That can lead a person to being very lazy. Just too sit in the house and go to websites. It has a big effect on a humans life. The computer technology have contecll over a huge population of recae. It really make miss out on half of their day. Second, people stay in the house on the computer other than exercising. It's very unhealthy for a person to sit down at a computer all day. The person has to eat so, basicly they eat and sit back down at the computer. It can get out hand because the computer allows people to grace food online. So that right there is an example of people not getting ecersise, and being lazy. You need to get your ecersise dayly. So people that doesnt get their ecersise need to start. Instead of sitting down on the computer all day. Third, many people over whole world have a lot of love one's that they care about and love. &quot;But&quot; they dnt get time to be with them, because they are always on the computer. The computer shouldn't take you away from you outdoor life. Okay, so what you can talk fo your friend and family over the computer. It's never like seeing them in person. Go outside and have fun and happy memories with your family. Because the computer is just words being texted. It's nothing like being said. I garrented you that. If you spend time with youre family then you will want to do it again. While your going out excersise and be interacting. In conclusion, if you are allways on the compute that's not good. Just take a few hours out of the day and ecersise. Go out and have a marvelous day. Because the computer doesn't do nothing but make you lazirer (@CAPS1 YOU). If your allways on the computer just be sure that you get your ecersise and your time with your family. It will make your a better person!
8	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, Computers have both negative and positive affects on people. Many people before us went through everyday life without them. Although there are many good affects that computers have on people, the negative affect's outnumber them by far. For example, generations have lived and died without computers and it didn't affect them. Not only that but many children and adults in this centry are obese due to growing technology. Many people become obese because they were born with this technology and after years, or even days of sitting in front of their computer, they become lazy. They look to a computer as necesity and not a form of entertainment. Even though computers keep people in contact and keep them updated in their lives, that is the only important reason for a computer. As a student, I use my computer for my schoolwork. Everything I do on my computer involves either typing a paper or printing research. I could do these things with paper and pencil and ask people what I'm trying to find out. This is important because it shows that people don't need to be defandent on computers when they can do everything they need to without them. Lastly, computers aren't needed when we have the availability of cell phones that keep everyone in contact without computer games, chats or profiles. Also phones are safe so they cant get viruses and strangers cant look at your personal information, finding out where you live. In conclusion computers aren't healthy, keep you sitting, without exercise and aren't nessasary.
10	When you are using technology usually it is work related. A computer is used for work to write essays, make power points, and research, when people use them for facebook, myspace, @CAPS1, and other chat live oovoo and websites it is more for their pleasure. I only go on facebook when I am checking my schedule for hockey, most kids use it for talk. Then there is oovoo &amp; online video chat used for talking with friends but why not just callem'up. When I think of facebook or oovoo, or even myspace it makes me think of inapropriate pictures kids, and adults post. I think that is very unhumane and that is very dangerous to post ot because once it's out there you'll never get it back. For instance I am always outsided hanginaround when it's warm out, during winter I can understand going on facebook, but during the @DATE1 there is no need just go outside and have fun. Kids wonder why they gain weight we'll if you'de get off your computer, and quit eating twinkies then you'll notice you just have to be active. some kids parents don't really give a flying faldoodle what their kids do all day. They don't care if their kid is @NUM1 lbs. at the age of @NUM2. They don't care if their kids are sitting on the computer eating all-day. If i could tell you what it must feel like to be a couch potato I would but I never go on the computer unless it is for homework. I used the computer just @TIME1 I typed up all of my homework except for my math. I didn't play one game, I didn't check email go on the internet or anything I just worked my hardest and got it done. I conclude this with the fact that using a computer is not a bad thing, using it repeatedly and not exercising is. A computer shouldn't need to be used for pleasure it's not created to do so it's created to keep your life simpler. People pay money to buy a expensive computer and motem and all that expensive technological accesories, to make their lives much simpler not anywhere in thes essay did I say to play games because it's not. Playing games can be done outside, it doesn't have to be inside, and definately doesn't have to be on a computer. To make everyones life easier kids, get off your lazy butts, get off the twinkies, and stop playing on the computer. 
8	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 Newspaper, Have you ever wanted to see your @CAPS3 that lives across the country? Well computers can do that. Ther re positive in effecting people in more ways, such as letteing people communicate with family or friends from across the world or letting everything be easy to find what they @CAPS4 many people are people isolate and keeping them from talking to family / friends I is helping them by being to chat or type to them. People can now talk to reltives in the comfort of thre home without having to about how they look. Computer also phone bills because of call your mom in @LOCATION1 just go on I chat and chat with her, it's just @CAPS5 you can see the computers Some people also think computers give people to much access to but ther it give people the of know what they This is good for school to for look for In my fall @NUM1. or people @CAPS6 you can see computers let you find the information you the time has that @CAPS7 computers without or keeping people away from family
9	@ORGANIZATION1, I believe that we should tell the people of @LOCATION1 about the dangers of using computers too much. For example people who use the computer constently spend less time doing anything else in general. Also the longer you stay on the more you use it, and this habit forms a addiction, which might be hard to break. Finally people who always play video games on computers begin to lose terms of reality. Computers are turning this nation into a bunch of mindless slothes. If you have children, what do you think they do most of their lives. Maybe their going outside and getting exercise, or their brains could be getting sucked into a computer screen. Most kids by the age of @NUM1 have already used a computer for over @NUM2 hour. This shows that kids spend more time using the computer then anything else. I had a friend named @CAPS1 who used the computer @NUM3 and eventually he was so weak and scrawny from lack of exercise that you could snap his arm like a twig. Please, if you don't want your kids to be like @CAPS1, tell them to get up and go play outside. You probably think that using your computer everyday couldn't form an addiction, but computers can be as addictive as drugs. Scientest have found that using the computer everyday for one hour can be enough to form a addiction. In fact if we could scan people to find addiction @PERCENT1 of the @LOCATION2 population would be addicted to computers. This means that @NUM4 years from now the world addiction to computers could be at @PERCENT2 or greater. Do you want to live in a world where almost everyone uses their computers @NUM3, I don't. Video games are one of the greatest advances in computer technology but also one of the deadliest. If you have a computer you will have video games. Small dosages can be fine, but non-stop playing can lead to serious problems. Because of the fantesy content people might start to lose sight of reality. For example, scientest tested a video game on kids, and now @PERCENT1 believe in zombies. Now they cannot ever play the game for it might cause serious brain damage. Just to make sure you get my point, let us recap. More computer means lack of exercise and social interaction, you can easily be addicted, and you can lose your sense of realness. I that you don't want to see you or your kids brillant brains turned to mush by computers.
12	The innovation of computers was a great leap into discovery. Unfortunately, the negative aspects of this magnificent invention detract from the novelty. With the computer came a plague of not exercising and a disinterest in, perhaps even an inabilty to enjoy nature. On top of this destruction of the mind, this monster is the cruel cause of many declining relationships for who has time for friends and family while in the middle of an internet game? As unique and intriguing as the computer might be, it is slowly destroying the mind. Increasing interest in a monitor tends to result in decreasing care for exercise as well as a decline in the amount of exercise gotten each day. While playing on the computer, the mind @MONTH1 be racing but the body sits unmoving, @CAPS1 activity is being done. Indeed, for some the addiction is awful enough that the person only moves to get food, use a restroom, go to bed or when a parent demands it. All of the day's food settles into the stomach and little to none of it is burned off. Meanwhile, in some of the more severe cases the person is so entranced that bedtimes are pushed later. Sleep is essential to the body and mind and going without can be damaging. Nowadays the computer detracts from the sleep and exercise that the body requires. Even nature suffered from the advent of computers. Fewer people went out to admire its beauty. Nature is a wonderful teacher about the circle of life and the natural way of the world. Oftentimes parallels can be drawn between the wild and the tamed. Attached as people are to computers, they cannot experience the world to the fullest. Some argue that flora and fauna can be found online, but seeing a picture is different, almost cheating, compared to being beside the plant, able to study it from all angles rather than in an unmoving form. The experience is not the same. Also, computers are indoors, so the true world is chielded from view. Even nowadays with laptops if one was to be brought outside, the user would be focusing on the screen, not what is around them. Computers have severely cut down on the admiration of nature. Even family and friends suffer when computers are around. Many people barely pay attention to conversation while focusing on the screen. They tend to onlypretend to listen half the time. Even when chatting with friends online, the conversation is disjointed because attention is probably focused on another part of the internet. Frequently, during conversations without a computer nearby, the mind is focused on something from earlier that day. Relationships are suffering, and computers are at fault. Computers are sucking in society, more of it each day. Much of what is done on computers, like the study of faraway places, can easily be found in books. Computers have resulted in a lack of exercise, less time with nature, strained relationships, and a generally unhealthy lifestyle. Through all of this, they have returned little to society. Why does the world continue to put up with computers and their negative effect on humanity?
8	Dear Newspaper, @CAPS1 computers become more and more a part of everyday life people begin to question wether or not they have a positive impact on people. Computers are a technological wonder that has a positive effect on people. The world wide web, unlimited socialization and simulations are just a few of the benefits of computers. The internet provides acess to the world wide we. Infinite amounts of information can be found on your computer. &quot;@CAPS2 in almost everyday school rely on the internet to gain information stated education secretary, @PERSON1. Also search engines provide acess to thousands of information loaded pages. In addition to unlimited information the web olds thousands of different web pages. With these people can learn about other peoples opinions or spend time playing games. The web is only one thing out of hundreds of great things about computers. Socialization is a huge of the moders life style. Web cames @CAPS1 on computers allow people to talk with friends who live miles away. No longer will people have to take an airplane to talk with friends on the other side of the world. Also, instant messaging and email is the main comunication system for thousands of people. It is the most efficient way to talk to friends. In fact, I became re connected with a lot of people I didn't talked to in a long time by getting email. Every body loves taking with their friends and family and this is made easier by using computers. Simulations are a huge benifit of computers. Many simulation programs are used to help people in their lives. Many proffessions using simulations on computers to help learn hot to do their job nine out of ten medical schools have the use of surgery simulations @CAPS1 part of their training course. Also, simulations and gaming on computers reveal interest for many people. I myself have a greater interest in history now after playing many historical themed computer games. Also many games and computer simulation have helped many people learn new things, @CAPS3 are countless learning games and simulations that are acessable by computer. Simulations add huge benifets to owning a computer. @CAPS1 technology advances people are opened up to many possibilities suck @CAPS1 information via the web unlimited socialization and simulations. The benifits of computers are many and the problems few. So, how can you keep up in a world where computer users hold the advantage if you deny the benifits of computers? Computers affect people in a positive way.
8	Dear @CAPS1, More and more people do use computers, but it is not a bad thing. Student come home from school tired, bored, and doesn't want to go outside and exercise. Students would rather go on the computer. When students go on the computer they can chat thier friends, listen to music, or learn about distant places. Firstly, students would chat their friends on the computer. When it is winter, students can't go outside and exercise. Students can grab their laptop, and go on their warm and comfortable table bed to chat friends. Maybe a friend can help with homework. Going outside in the winter can make students sick and miss days of school. Secondly, students like to listen to music. Music is an important part to a student because music lyrics can express themselves. Students @MONTH1 be dancing to their favorite song. Dancing is exercise and adults do say we need more exercise. Also students can play very soft music than not doing homework at all. Thirdly, students can learn about distant places. When I am on the computer I type in www.google.com and want to learn about a place where I want sto visit other student might want to learn about places they've never visited. Italy, france, @LOCATION1, and much more places people would want to visit. They would want to learn about places before ever go. In conclusion @CAPS1, more and more people go on the computer, but it does not have to be a bad thing. Yes, students should go exercise but all the time. When students go on the computer they can chat with friends. Secondly, students can listen to music. Thirdly, they can learn about distant places. @CAPS1, it is not a bad thing that students go on the computer.
8	Dear Newspaper, I know the debate on wether computers benifit soscity is greatly debated but to me the answer is odvious. The internet is an extreamly useful invention, used in all schools and is only inconvient when misused. I'm not saying that its @PERCENT1 nessary for every house to contain one, but that its a luxay most people have. The computer and internet combination is probally one of the most genis ideas ever thought up. It is basically any information in a click. Websights such as myspace and facebook allow you to connect and reconnect with friends old and new. Also the ability to create your own web page is greatly useful when trying to promote a bisnuess or company. Not only that but the internet also makes it possible to purchace clothes online without having to go to the store. I know thats useful for those parents, like many that hate driving to the mall. Second, I can garentuee you that almost every school in the country has a working computer with accessable internet. The computer was just one huge leap forward for eduication. These are many websights with a eduicationly purpose only. These are websights like this for children and adults of any age. Many teachers now adays are assinging homework where the internet is nessary. Also tests such as the blue ribbon test are taken online. I can tell you right now that mant teachers would be torn apart without the compluter. Lastly, one of the most important issues. The downsides of the internet. Even though myspace and facebook are ment for good they also have a dark side.
8	Dear @PERSON1 editor, I think that the computers have both positive and negative effects, but more positive. For example, when people get home from work or school, they immedlatly go on the computer, to check email, do work, or to play games. I think that it's good to connect with friends and learn about the far away nature and people that we cant see, but too much of it will be bad. I know it will be bad because it can cause a lack of exercise and the computer can cut you off from your family and friends if you're on it too much, I think it's good to go on the computer for a limited amount of time each day, but also spend time outside with family and friends. The computer is good because of all the extrodinary things it offers and the things you can learn. I myself like to play video games on it like bubble spinner but at the same time I'll be on facebook, facebook lets me connect with friends and family while bubble spinner helps with hand-eye coordination, when projects came along I usually do all my research there, picking up information on each site. I also do all the writing on it too so it wont look messy but instead, clean and neat. The computer also offers video of pretty much anything on t.v. and otherwise, like youtube or google videos. The computer lets me see nature, talk to friends and family, and lets me see things, like videos, that twill never ever see in books. These show that the computer has a bigger positive impact than negative and we should take advantage of the new technology that we have and not let it go to waste. The computer is a nice outlit to come home and let yourself unwind to. People say that you don't get enough exercise but we have gym and recess at school and we become exhausted at work, which is enough exercise for the day. Computers are a nice device to have and are by far, used daily by almost everyone. So it can't be all that bad by depriving you from nature and family because it lets you see it anyway. The effects it has on people are good because of the knowledge and communication it brings. I hope you see my point of view.
10	Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 are very dangerous to the modern day socity and how we are connected to them. So I belive that these atroshish things should bery well be disposed of. There are good reasons of thinking such a thought that is in this time with such an eviormetal breakdwon we need to get close to nature while it's still here. Next today our interaction is very low when if your talking about actuall talking to the person and because of computers it makes @CAPS3 all the more lazy while sitting around doing nothing. Lastly the @CAPS2 is harmful and expensive not to menshon the fact that the enviorment is already falling apart. The way natures heading we will all end up dieing no thanks to computers. First how hamful it today is @PERCENT1 of @CAPS3 own computers. In america theres only @PERCENT2 is nature with nice forest but as people reporduce more will be gone forever due to expantion. So be one of the @NUM1 out of @NUM2 that instead of staing iside views the great things the earth has to offer. Next these computers our little robots that are really taking over the world and its getting very dangerous with how much it's destroying the ability for humans to breath this happens because theres a hipno disk in all computers making us stay close sufficating us like a deadly drug it's a horrible addiction. Lastly @PERCENT3 of deaths are due to @CAPS2 overloads imagene all the lives that could be saved if they just went to breath every @NUM3 minets I mean on average @NUM4 hours a day your looking at a @CAPS2 take time off make a goal for say @NUM5 hours. This addiction will kill us and knone knows how to talk about it. Secondly, millions on top of millions live in the @LOCATION1 @NUM6 keep on their computers for ours on a time you would think that their alone in every @NUM7 people are done the rest are being killed by chatting on the @CAPS2 and letting their life flow right out of the window. Now interaction is harmful as you already know but you forgot @NUM8 a day do elligal things on the internet like download music wich they shouldn't be they could be put away for up to @NUM9 years for this talk about an iteraction, with the police. Lastly web inter action like myspace they haves satified sexual effenders who could come to your house at only time and take you away would you like that to happen you could never see your family in every @NUM10 people @PERCENT4 are kidnapped due to myspace alone stand up out of danger. Thats a harmful work it is. Finally the dangers of a world like this with how the government whats to mess you up. These people are considered are mad and dangerous with laywars who want to get you. One in every @NUM11 people can't keep up with payments. Next did you forget about those other @PERCENT3 who dont have computers they are living the life walking with @CAPS4 on the edge of myth. Lastly and unfortunatly those @PERCENT1 perstent witho computers are likly to die within the next @NUM12 years due to a dealy poisin that the compute diliveres to your brain. In conclution this world can be one of the more angerest. So come to gether get a friend go for a run now and then. No friends go talk see your family instead of one of those vertual meaings. Just keep in mind the dangers of the @CAPS2 world and how it wants your money. Now what we need to do is attak the robots back. People should go for a run cut of some of the obisity from sitting down all day lose @NUM9 pounds or more. Remember the world would survive if you trash that zombie @CAPS2 room. Get outside go for a road trip save life humanity your fellow niebor your family.
10	Dear Readers, @CAPS1 has come to my attention that there is a debate on whether or not computers benefit society. This issue is debatable but really I think that computers are not helping the big picture. I don't think that they benefit our health or social actions because computers keep us inside when we could be out. Everyday when I come home from school, I find myself going straight inside and to the computer from there, I log into @CAPS2 and @CAPS3. And my exersize in the next @NUM1 hours or so is only in my fingers. My point is that there is a whole world outside of we only got off our computers and played outside. Statisctis show that @NUM2 kids spend more time inside year-round than out these days. &quot;@CAPS1 is ridiculous how much things have changed in just @NUM3 years.&quot; says @PERSON1 a pediatrician in @LOCATION1, &quot;they all need thier exersize.&quot; @CAPS1 is cutrogeous how much people are on computers now, @CAPS1 starts to affect thier attitude, and control thier lives. Sometimes checking notifications on @CAPS3 can be more important to someone than spending time with thier family or friends. A mom of @NUM4 teens says &quot;They all go to thier rooms, shut thier doors and go on @CAPS3 and @CAPS6 untill dinner and after, they go right back.&quot; In this case, they just plug into thier computers and forget about everyone else. I think @CAPS1 has gotten out of hand how much people and teens especially are addicted to computers. 1/@NUM4 mom says she sees her kid growing apart from the family because of a computer. You @MONTH1 say that when on your computer there is a person you are talking to, and while pen-pals are great, you should really go out and do something! You are talking your friends, but its not the same as being with them. On my recent trip to @LOCATION2 to go skiing, I found that some of my friends jokes funnier when you're with her and not just sitting on a computer. We had a blast! Now I regret not getting together with her to hang out. Also @NUM6 arguments now, have something to do with a missunderstanding through the computer, people @MONTH1 get the wrong message when you send something to them or they take @CAPS1 the wrong way. The truth is, computers are starting to take negative effect on our society and even ruin relationships. If we just get off our computers and get out, we can turn that around.
8	Dear Local Newspaper, I am writing a letter to you to explain why I think computers are not good to have. My three supporting reasons are that if you are on the computer all the time there's a chance that you might gain weight and becom obese. You would rather be on the computer than to hang out with your family, and lastly you won't have any friends to talk to. Please read on to hear my story. First of all if your always on the computer your not going to get up and go outside for a little because it won't be important to you. Also your going to have to eat and when you get exited your going to want to eat more. Then you'll start getting overweight because you don't want to exercise. Secondly, you would spend less time with your family. You would think that your going to hang out with them later. So then you play more and get addicted. So then you and your family would grow apart. And you would be lonely because you gave up your family just so you can play a game on the computer. For my last reason on this matter is that you wont have friends. I think you won't have friends because if your on the computer all the time you wont even bother to go to the park to play or go to the gym, to try to get into sports then you won't meet anyone. The only friends that you would most likely have is friends on the computer. That you will never meet in real life and won't socialize to the about there life and to hang out with. In conclusion I think it is not a good idea to have a computer because you can become obese, you will spent less time with your family, and you won't have any friends to talk to. I hope you enjoyed this letter and take it into consideration.
7	Dear, Local Newspaper, In my opinion computers are everything, They provide with so many things for you to do like chess, listening to music, and even downloading you favorite movies. First of all, computers are a great source of communication because if you have a long distance relative that lives in @LOCATION1 then you can talk to them online. You can do this through via email. Instant message, and @CAPS1. Secondly, Computers let you search the web. So if you need to findout some directions to your destination or want to get informaion on some far awat places like @LOCATION3, @LOCATION2, @LOCATION4, or my favorite @CAPS2 @CAPS3 you can because the web lets you do that. Thirdly, they are a great source of entertainment. Well because you can watch episodes of your favorite @CAPS4.V. show or you can watch music videos. Also you @MONTH1 enjoy listening to music from your computer as you personal entertainment. I think that computers are great. I use them myself as an example I love to download music into my ipod from my computer. Then I get to enjoy the music from my ipod. Last, but not least, @CAPS5 computers have a great effect on a majority of people. I believe that if we didn'@CAPS4 have computers then our world wouldn'@CAPS4 be the same. So I say keep computers here to stay. They complete us all.
8	I think that computers have a bad effect on people. I think that because of many reasons and I will tell you some of these reasons. One reason would be not get exercise going on the computer all day, you will only get worse. Say if you were @NUM1 years old and when computers come out you bought one and went on it every day instead of being fit. Then if you have no exersize then you will get bigger and bigger. Another reason if you would only use computers for research I say this because there is no reason to go on your computer all day a good reason to go on the computer would be if you have some kind of project for school or a job instead of just using your computer for facebook or myspace. Then there is some kind of diesese that can happen to your if it does the same thing to many times. Your dont want to do that because if you dont use computer that much and you play some kind of sport like football, baseball, or any other kind of around some place. Also if kind of surgery on it and that will cause you from doing almost everything with that one hand. My last reason go on the computer your viruses connected to it. If you do that then mabe your computer will lost everything on it. Then you have to get a new computer and everything all. If you bought a new computer and you got somebody can hack your computer and get all of the information from it. The information then they like how. And if you dont know person you dont know what they can do. So I hope you dont buy something that has a really bad virus else like that. Those would be all reasons on why you shouldnt go on the computer to much and why it does not really help other then when you are doing research or any other kind of work or job related way.
12	@ORGANIZATION1, ore and more people use computers @DATE1, but this is not necessarily a good thing. Spendign too mcuh time on computers affects your activity level. Also. Kids are now staying up later on the compute, in turn lowering grades. Finally, spending too much time on the computer decrease the amount of time spent with friends and family. Firstly, spending too much time on the computer affects your activity level. The more time spent has on a computer, the less time a person has to do something active, like exercising @PERCENT1 of people spend more than @NUM1 @NUM2 hours on the computer per day, if @NUM3 or so hours were used to exercise or play a sport that number would decrease to @PERCENT2 according to a recent study. Doctors have said that at least @PERCENT3 of overweight parents spend most o ftheir time on the computer, thus limiting their time exercising. The amount of spent on the computer has been shown to decrease activity level and effect the number of overweight and obese people everywhere. If we want to become a healthier country, we should state @CAPS5 writing time spent on computers. Also kids now stay up later on computers and lower then grades @CAPS5 doing so. More time spent on @CAPS1 or anywhere on the @CAPS2 means less time studying, which means lower grades. Kids in spent an average of @NUM3 @NUM2 hours on the computer each day, while kids spend @NUM6 @NUM2 hours each day. A student in @PERSON2 saw their grades improve from a @CAPS3+ to a @CAPS4+ just @CAPS5 spending less time on the computer and more. That studnet also felt more because they get more computer. This tests and quizzes. Computers clearly negative effect on grades and school work. Finally, computers limit the amount of time spent with family nd friends. A student, @PERSON1, said that she, spent more time going out with friends now that computer isn't up all my time, @CAPS5 doing this, i have a better friendshhip with all my friends than before. &quot;A kid that uses the computer during all of the free time spends @PERCENT4 less time with friends than someone who usues it in moderation. Afmilies also suffer from this a swell. If a family member spends all their time on the computer, the other family members will have less of a relationship with them because they don't talk or do anything together an dwill likely not know what is going on i their life or if something is wrong. As you can tell, computers also have a negative effect on relationships with family and friends. The overuse of computers does nnot benefit society. They affect a persons activity level, students grades and most importantly a persons realtionships with family and friends. In oredr to ake our country a better and healthier place, we must the time spent on computers.&quot;
6	In my opinion computer ars benefit with the socient here are my s reasons, I can talk wit my friends, I can do my homework, or I can do olner things in the computer to. First reasons, I can talk with my friends or I can talk with my family on facebook or myspace o his on msn or I can se my family in the camera msn the camera is allot of help with me because lik my family is in @LOCATION1 I chat with them every @DATE1 instead of sending pictures and videos or going visiting to @LOCATION1. Next reasons, I can do my homework on I can write a big letter on I can do a lot of work in the computer is and easy. Final reason I can do a lot of things like find a question or do project on.
10	Computers. One of the much enjoyed pieces of technology. But it is also one of the many distractions. Many people ponder if computers are really beneficial. I am one of those thinkers. I think that computers don't always benefit society. They have many, many distractions such as facebook, online games, and even inappropriate images and videos. If you really think of it, are computers as beneficial as we think? My friend, @PERSON2 was just told about facebook, and got a membership. It just started out as a 'na big deal' kind of thing. She went online often, just to check on her status and if she had any messages in her inbox, and that's @CAPS2. But then, she was full-blown addicted. She applied for @CAPS2 the clubs and groups, and she started getting behind in school. She was obtaining a plethora of @CAPS1's on most of her tests after not studying because she was on for almost six hours everyday. @PERSON2 would come home and not even bother to do homework, but would just immediately go online. After one month of being a member, she was failing @CAPS2 of her classes, and her mom took her computer priveleges away. See, she was distracted by one, little thing, and her whole life was almost destroyed. &quot;But, mom, i'm in the middle of a game! And I'm winning!&quot; @PERSON1 says vistoriously. @PERSON1 loves online games, and he wins almost @PERCENT1 of the time. But, that's not the point. He plays games @CAPS2 the TIME. @PERSON1's game playing gets in the way with the interaction of him and his family. He @CAPS3't played eith his four year old sister, @PERSON3 since she was two years old. his mother also often eats dinner alone. Sometimes, he even views inappropriate pictures when his mom is out shopping. When he's playing a game, a girl @CAPS4 him, &quot;@CAPS5 at my pic. They're hot! and he looks at them. He thinks they're harmless but that's not what his mother thinks. his gaming has gotten in the way of his family and social life. most people think that computers are beneficial because you can find cool information. But, you can get @CAPS2 kinds of information from books. Instead of typing '@ORGANIZATION1', you could just @CAPS5 for it in a library. It takes less time, and you won't get carpal tunnel as easily. See? Computers aren't as beneficial as most think. There are @CAPS2 kinds of distraction, and these are only a few.
9	Computers are a nice item to have but they are bad if you don't know how to control your time. Many people @CAPS3 days don’t get enough exercise and the lack of healthy people is costing the @CAPS1 tax payers millions. Also, people aren't enjoying life as much as they would if they didn't use a computers all of the time and thier are many people who have completely cut themselves off frfom their families and friends. I am positive that when you are done reading this you will be, one hundred percent pursuaded that the effects computers have on people are bad. To begin with, many people spend to much time on a computer instead of being outside or execising. This effect on people is something we need to start controlling because many people are very overweight and do not exercise enough to be healthy. Because so many are at an weight it is costing tax payers millions. For example, @CAPS2 @PERSON1 talking about healthcare, and anc easy sollution to cut the cost down is to have people exercise. More ofen in order to stay healthy. As technology to affect our lives, we used to remember that being healthy is more important than sitting on a computer all day. In addition to people not people dont enjoy life as much, You only live once and life is special, so why sitting all day? I many anymore because they spend all of there @CAPS3 are so many things to do in life that will bring you enjoyment than playing on the a computers. need to be and I can tell you that you life will not being you in enjoyable luife. Lastly, computers have made a lot of people when people got to Too many people a major view when it comes to family and friends. Although computers are an easy way to communicate to people, they should not be the anly thing you use to talk to friends and family. So as you can see, computers are causing us to lead on-healthy lives because our priorities on health are why to low. They also keep you from enjoying life, to the fullest and can separate you from friends and family when not controlled. I am positive that I have pursuaded you not to spend so much time on a computer. So next time you are using a computers, think of all the things you are missing out in life!
10	Dear, Newspaper In my mind the computer benifits us in many different ways. Computers are entertaining, computers help us with education, and the heath/safty purposes are fantastic. People love entertainment. Computers are very fun. At electronic stores computer games are sold. These games are usally good. Instead of having games that are bad for the brain most compuer games are not. My friend @PERSON2 bought a computer game last week. @CAPS4 says @CAPS3 is very entertaining but is not brain damaging. Everyone loves watching @CAPS1.V. On computers people can now watch @CAPS1.V. Not only is that entertaining but @CAPS3 will save money because you don'@CAPS1 need a @CAPS1.v. Now people can insteadly down load @CAPS1.v. shows and movies on thier computer. @PERSON1 just got a new computer for his birthday last week. &quot;@CAPS3 is so fun watching @CAPS1.v. on my computer and @CAPS3 is so easy.&quot; @CAPS4 explained. Learning from @PERSON1 I hope you can learn how entertaning computers are. At school we use computers all the time. If we did not have computers we would not learn the same. On his new computer @PERSON1 can do all his projects and homework on @CAPS3. Before @CAPS4 had his computer @CAPS4 had to write out all his papers and when @CAPS4 finished @CAPS4 spent to long writing that @CAPS4 could not do his rest of homework. Now @CAPS4 can not type @CAPS3 out, and still do all his other homework. If you think that amazing then read this. Research done by @ORGANIZATION1 found out that @PERCENT1 of kids with computer are smarter than before they had thier computers. &quot;I was getting all @CAPS5's when I did not have my computer. Now I get honors on my report card because of my computer.&quot; @PERSON1 says. I hope people can now be like @PERSON1 and buy computers. Do you want to have a smarter world? Computers open up an all news heath and safty field. You @MONTH1 learn a little about geneitics. @CAPS3 would have took about @NUM1 years longer to crack the code of the genes of we did not have computers. All the information scientists have learned from the human geno project can cure cancer and other dieseases. Computers are also safe to make sure your kids are safe. New technology can track kids. If an unfortunet event happens an your kid is missing then a computer can help to find him. A new mother lost her kid last @DATE1 while eating lunch at a park. She knew she had a chip in the childs body. She opened her laptop and found where her kid was. Amazing right. I hope everyone can have a computer for heath and safty reasons. I hope you can now see that computers benifit the society from heath and safty to education in school. Without computers we could not be where we are today.
8	Dear @CAPS1 or @CAPS2 The purpose of this letter is about how computers have changed our lives for the better. They have improved our society. Changed our way of life and have made things easier. I am a firm beliver that computer were one of the greatest invention of all time. Computers have had a very vital and positive impact on society. For example, education has vastly expanded since the computer. Both teachers and students have benefited. Students can now search the intrenet and learn about different places, things in history, how to read and write bette, etc. Also computers have been a major part in entertainment. From reading online news to watching movies and listening to music computers entertain all of us. And computers help us connect with friends and even meet new people. Aside from that computers make life easier. People can get degrees from learning online learn another. Research as also easier than is to computers you can just about anything than to computers. Some people say computers stop people acting with family but infact facebook you can still. Computer have also ourlives. From helping small buiness thrive by making it easier to make and recieve orders to help spread information globaly computers make this all possible. As I have shown computers have benefited society and have had a positive effect on human beings from educating individuals to staying in touch with relitives, computers have made their mark on improving the way we live. I hope this letter will help show you that computers are a necesary part of the twenty first century.
9	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I think that having a computer is a very positive. I know that teenagers are on the computer a lot, but if it really bother the parents, why do they have computers in their houses? @CAPS3, I can tell you @NUM1 reason why. They are good sources of information, its a good way to talk with your friends and it gives you information about places that you might not know about. Primarily, I would like to say that computer are a fantastic source of information. They can tell you anything! This is also helpful because if you are working on a project, and your mom cant you to get books at library, then there you go! A computer is just a simpler way to look up information. Did you know, that @PERCENT1 of parents who got their family a computer do not regret their desicion? Thats almost all the parents in @LOCATION2! @CAPS6 as you can see, it would help kids with whatever they are studying. Secondly, we teenagers today use computers to talk with our friends @ORGANIZATION1 email @CAPS3, I think this is alot better than sending @CAPS4! Why would you wait letter from your cousin @LOCATION1. When you can talk to them in seconds! And it do paper if you just @CAPS5 to buy I would like to say that having like this one time, I was work my we were looking for a hotel to stay in when we went to we ended up finding a great hotel, for a cheap You can also go on map guest if you @CAPS5 to someone. @CAPS6 for all the people out there who dont computers are important have would you to In conclusion, I think that having a computeer is a very important thing for @NUM1 reson they are very good book source they help us communicate with friends and for every information on for @CAPS6 imleaving the opinion with you hopefully you will learn something than better and pick the right 
12	Almost every family has access to a computer. They have become a part of life and a way to be a part of life outside of your house, even if you have to stay at home. Computers are a source of vast knowledge from millions of sources. They have already caused exponential advancement. Overall, computers have a positive effect. on a rainy day, @NUM1 students will spend time on their computers. out of those students, @PERCENT1 will be on sites such as A.I.M.(@CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3), @CAPS4, @CAPS5, or @ORGANIZATION2. Even if they can't use their phone or get out of the house, they can communicate with friends, old and new. Teens and adults use the @CAPS6 to talk in friends they haven't seen for up to @NUM2 years. People will talk to eachother more, building more relationships and better conversational skills. Over @NUM3 of the sites used by teens are based on @CAPS8 networking. To be able to easily have a conversation with someone miles away is a sign of tremendous advancement. @ORGANIZATION1 is a multi-million dollar company. @PERSON1, a for @ORGANIZATION1, says that sites like @ORGANIZATION1 have skyrocketed in popularity over the @DATE1. More and more people are putting down their @PERSON2 dictionary to type the word into @LOCATION1, where it is accompanied by a pronunciation and found more easily. Students use computers for information on school reports in @CAPS7, @CAPS8 @CAPS9, @CAPS10, or @CAPS11. Information can be found in any subject. There was a survey taken to see which is used more often, books with a specific subject or computers for information or various subjects. Computers are used overwhelmingly more often. They're quicker than books and it's easier to search for a of resource an the @CAPS6. And say sight of particular interest or exceptionally usefull can be added to your favorites. Computers are more practical than books. Pictures of scientific laboratories where space shuttles are sent to the moon have @NUM4 main component computers. Adds from @ORGANIZATION3 show that they're computers are getting smaller and smaller. There's a laptop that will fit in an envelope and a handheld touch screen computer that can almost fit in your pocket. You can type papers and assignments so they're more ledgible. Computers can even score tests. Advancement is centered around computers. Before computers, so many things we do now would seem impossible. But computers open up a realm of possibilities. Typing is faster then hand-writing in some cases and papers can be saved electronically. If our country keeps advancing at the rate, than it is possible to have computers that do maindain chores such as taking out the trash or washing the dishes. There can be computers that talk bark to you like a real conversation. People can learn more and more information and personally advance in intelligence. I look at a computer and think of progress. There are points of computers that are not ideal, but overall, computers are benefitial to society. In a computer, you have access to friends old and new and information from millions of sources. Most of all, computers represent progress and advancement I see no direct harm from computers.
11	Dear @ORGANIZATION1, The use of computer benefits society due to the possitive affect on people. Such as good hand-eye coordination, ability to learn about far away places and people as well as being able to talk online with family and friends. Did you know that teenagers who use computers often when compared to those who don't, have increased test scores? This is because they are able to look so definitions faster, research and learn about anything they need at their fingertips. Furthermore, families and friends that live across the country are able to keep in touch due to email, video chats and facebook. It is fascinating to realize that use of the computer can increase your hand eye coordination. You are probably wandering how this is and think that I am insane but there are legitimate reasons. Since I play basketball, volleyball and softball, hand eye coordination is extremely important. One cold, wintery @DATE1 @TIME1. I was working on a long history paper and @CAPS1 essay, which meant countless hours on the computer typing. At five o'clock off I went to my basketball grow, @CAPS2 the best game of my life was playerl. Then, a week later, we had another game but this time I went straight from church. Consequently, I did not play as well; missed a lot of passes and shots. This proved to me that things use of computers, my hand-eye coordination improved. Can you imagine being able to learn about people in faraway places, their cultures, ethicities and relgion? Well now this is more than possible through the advances in technology. In history, we were doing research on the world hunger crisis in our allied countries. Through the knowledge of this hunger, I was able to start a fundraiser at my church. @PERSON1; @CAPS2 teenagers like myself do not eat for @NUM1 hours. Research has proven that @NUM2 children in countries of africa die a day from malnurutousment. Now that this has been brought to my attention, I am going to work four hours a day to give these innocent children even a portion of what I consume. Thus through the use of computers I was able to learn about the pain those children suffer and now it's my . Do you have family that's across the country that you are rarely able to see? My aunt and uncle live in @LOCATION3 and they were just blessed with a beautiful baby boy, @LOCATION4. Since we are only graced with their presenced about once a year we begin to miss them. But now through skype, email and facebook, we are able to stay updated on the success and growth of @LOCATION4 as well as @CAPS2 they have recently traveled to. Also @PERCENT1 as the teenage population in the @CAPS3.S spend at least four hours a day @CAPS4, tweeting or using facebook to stay in touch with their friends. Recently, I have moved from @LOCATION2 to @LOCATION1 and staying in contact with my fr iends there is extremely important to me. Those are the people that I grew up with and have known since birth. The use of computers has allowed me to stay in contact with distant friends and relatives. To conclude, due to improved hand-eye coordination, ability to learn about far away places and people as well as being able to communicate online, with other people the use of computers benefits society. Through the internet, people can learn about @LOCATION2 places to travel bike and exercise while enjoying nature. Furthermore, when family and friends want to spend time together, they need to plan the logistics of it and without email and being online this becomes nearly impossible. I appreciate you taking the time to read this and hopefully you will take my opinion into consideration when debating over the topic of computer.
8	Dear local newspaper, I think your wrong!!. I totally disagree with this letter. People need computers to do research. Also helps us keep in contact with others. Another thing is @CAPS1 can get anything needed. First, @CAPS1 need computer. @CAPS1 need computer to help us with research. Instead of picking up a book you can go online. It's faster and easier. Also, You can look up information on any place or any project and it will help you. Thats the graet thing the @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4 has any information. Next, The @CAPS2 @CAPS3 web is also used for keeping in contact. For example, instant messaging. Also you can chat on @CAPS5 or @CAPS6. You can even go in chat room. But just keep in mind know who you're talking to because it might be a stranger. Anyways you can use the internet @CAPS7 an easy way to talk to people or to &quot;keep in contact&quot;. Lastly, @CAPS7 you know the internet is used for research and talking but also for getting anything you want. You can go online and get pictures, games, videos, music or even directions to a place. Also the internet is used to just have fun. I use it mostly for ypoutube, @CAPS5, and for googling pictures. You can look up basicly any thing on line and it will most likely be there for you. In conclusion, the web is used for researching. Also for chatting. Finally for basicly anything you want it for. That is why @CAPS1 should have internet because you can still go online but have fun outside to. But maybe people should cutback a little on @CAPS8.V. Now do you see why I chose this side? Maybe in the future there will be a way to go on the computer but be active to.
11	Dear editor, I believe that computers are an important part of modern life and proves itself to be available because everyday. Many times we don't even think about using computers, it just becomes a part of our dayly routine. We use computers everyday in many ways, sometimes to stay intouch with a far away friend learn about and experience faraway places, or @MONTH1 be ever to practice hand eye coordination. Computers are so benifical to our life we might not be able to live without them. Most people have experienced a friend or relitive move, when this happens not all hope is lost because with the use of you run stay in touch. Many computers nowadays have built in webcams which alows you to get more than just an email. With these systems you can actualy get an image of your fried or relative. Even oprah winfrey uses the webcam feature on computers to have people &quot;skype&quot; on to her show. In adition to this there are many other ways to stay in touch even if your computer is older and have. These reletively new &quot;social networking series&quot; include facebook, twitter, and many more. Every morning when i wake up and on sportscenter i always about what famous are posting or twitter pages. This is just another great use of computers. In this economy not many people are spending thousands of to go to a beach paradise in the but with the use of computers, you can go there virtualy. Computers are great in this aspect because they alow you to learn and experience many expensive things for. For example if you wanted to learn somthing about india, you would dn't have to go to the local library and check out a book, you could just type there are many such as this that give you access information that you could ever need. This prooves also to be valable if you are studing faraway while a paper. The computer is just a great way to get information with out every having to leave your home. Hand-eye coordination is an important skill that many people lack. It alows you to throw a baseball, play videogames, or even drive car. Many computer sceptics believe that you don't benifit from using computers but a recen study done by @LOCATION1 news and report reveals that people who use computers had @PERCENT1 better hand-eye-coordination than computers users. When driving you often need to operate the car, up the radio volume, and pass out goldfish to your kids at the same time, so this could be as where improved hand-eye cordination would be handy. Hand eye coordination is an important and this skill is further developed by the use of computers. In conclusion, computers are benificial both in hand-eye coordination and in communication, as well as in geting information or a topic. Computers are one the most significant ever and are valuble in many many ways.
9	I think using the computer is great. You should heed my advice, people should be useing computers. Computers are an exelent way to comunicate. People can connect with others from all over the world. My dad moved to brazil so we have ben communicating via, @CAPS1-mail, @CAPS2, and even facebook. It’s the easyest and cheapest way to comunicate. If I call someone from a different country it would cost me way more but if I send them an @CAPS1-mail it’s cheaper. Studys from the university of @LOCATION1 show that @PERCENT1 people think its easyer and to use a computer to comunicate. More over you can do it instantly so it gets the information anywhere in milliseconds. Computers are indeed the best way to comunicate. Another thing computers are used I for as learning. Many people from around the world have learned diffrent languages from wed sites or programs that have great instruction and lessons. I learned to play guitar with maney programs and online lessons. Maney people depend on computers to get information and learn about things. My mom is a secretary at an inseurens broker companey. Without computers the coustemers couldn’t learn about the diffren policeys that there are and they misth be spending more money then needed on insearence. With out computer scientests couldn’t do much reasarch or learn about plants or rocks. Computers make it easyer for them to study and learn about @LOCATION2 and everything. Doctors wouldn’t be adel to do half of the thing they can with out a computer. They learn about diffrent sicknesses and broken bones by useing computers. @PERSON2 said she couldn’t be able to help out as many people with out the use and help of a computer she states that she learned @PERCENT2 of what she knows from websites that have in formation about the humin body. Even teachers say that they set better teaching skills from web sites. Builder and modern desiner @PERSON1 says he learned about different building designes that are sturdyer and stronge shapse he used this in his building today. I hope that you can how see how great computer are and how much they help our present day citizens.
8	Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 do you think is the best technology made so far? Computer! They are the best technology because you can do anything on the computer. My friends say computers are one @ORGANIZATION1 the best technology because the internet can help a lot @ORGANIZATION1 things like if you have research paper. Research has proven that computers are a positive effect on people. My mom says computers are one @ORGANIZATION1 the most hardiest tools in the world. @PERCENT1 @ORGANIZATION1 my friends say that computers are one @ORGANIZATION1 the best because you can get help from the internet on homework assignments. They say that for people to talk online with other people. They said that they can interact with family members who live far away. They also said that on being on the computer has taking more teens @ORGANIZATION1 the streets and in their homes. Dr. @ORGANIZATION1 has done extensive research and has proven that being on the computer teaches you hand-eye cordination. Another thing he has proven is since computers has been invented the violence rate has gone down because more people spend time at home on their computers rather than out on the streets. He also proven that since people have started schools the success in school grades has gone way up. He thinks they have gone up because, instead @ORGANIZATION1 students reading long boring article on someone or something they can just search it on the internet. He said using the internet also saves more time. My mother syas when she was younger the computer gave her the ability to learn about far away places. My mother said that the internet would also let you learn about people customs rather than reading books because some books have not yet been upgraded and you would want to learn about their newest customs also. My mom thinks that using computer is a posotive effect on the world. @CAPS1 you are doing a fine job at writing at your job. My friends say computers are helpful, research has proven that computers have dropped the percentage at violence down, my also thinks that the computers is a posotive effect on us. I know you will agree with me when I say that having computers has put a powerful effect on people it gives people an easier time in life.
9	Dear Newspaper, &quot;@CAPS1 no!' I forgot the deffinition to this homework problem and I don’t have my notes. Now, in this situation a computer would be very helpful to just type in the word and get a whole bunch of results. This is why I believe having access to a computer at all times is very helpfull because you can find information that you've been needing. You can get in touch with a friend if you need to or just to talk to lostly if you are just sitting around and having nothing to do you can just go on the computer and discover things you @MONTH1 not have known. Having access to a computer is a real and very helpfull because if your just having a conversation with someone and you forget a name of an important fact you want to tell them, you can always just look it up. For me, a lot of the times I just need information about maybe a sports player of facts about a famous event. Since our technology is so up to date the computer is right there sitting with many of the helpfull facts we would like to know. Friends are a big part of my life and I love just to talk to them and see how they are doing. Again, our technology is so advanced now that there is a bunch of websites where we can talk and see how we are doing. A big reason why being able to talk to friends and family is helpful is for taking to people that are very far away and the ones you dont normally see. On a computer you can talk to people from not only all over the @CAPS2.S.A but even in other countrys! Finally, the times I find having a computer around me most helpfull is when I am just bored with nothing to do! I can just visit a whole bunch of educational websites on things I @MONTH1 have learned in school or wanted to learn. On the internet there are many things to keep you occupied like games or ou can even watch movies from your home onto the computer! If you have a computer around your house you should not be bored because there is many things you can be doing or even learning! Having a computer around your house is so helpfull, you can have fun but your even learning how to be good with technology at the same time. Computers are the future and its a good one. So I suggest you pick one up and just have a blast, you wont be sorry.
10	Dear, Local Newspaper, @CAPS1 @PERCENT2 of the people would agree that computers are useful and by having them they help ability to learn about faw away place. They also, allow people to talk to other people online. Lastly, computers are importat @CAPS2 people that work with them. there are many reasons why I believe that computers benefit our society. Do you know that computers give people the ability to learn about faw away places. Sometimes people, dont know when they want to leave the country. With a computer you can organize it all. Somoe people like my family, like to go visit their familys in other places, @CAPS2 example, once my mom told me we were going on a trip to @LOCATION1 to go visit our family she told me she already got the tickets on the computer. I was very happy when we went and I saw how beautiful @LOCATION1 is. Some people like to see new and beautiful places. Such as , @LOCATION3, @LOCATION2 and even @LOCATION4. Let me tell you about how computers allow people to talk to other people online. Most people have myspace and that allows kids my age to keep in touch. Also, facebook that you can and people that you probly havent seen in a long time. @CAPS2 exsample, one time I was looking aroung facebook and found my old bestfriend @PERSON1. I was so happy cause when she moved I thought i would never talk to her again. I am @PERCENT1 positive that everyone in this world has a yahoo you could find people really quikck and talk to them. Would you belive that there is so many jobs and responsibilities that require you to have a computer. Such as scientists they all have to have computers or else they wouldnt be able to invient all the great things they make. Also, secretaries they have asign dates @CAPS2 their bosses. @CAPS2 exsample, a secretary @CAPS2 doctor has to be able to give and to change appointments. Lastly, students that go to school and most importantly collage with no computers, they wont be able to do their homework. Most people would agree that computers have a positive affect on people. @CAPS2 the reasons that they give the ability to learn about faw away places, allow people to talk to other people online. Computers are very important to people who work with them.
8	Dear Newspaper, @CAPS1 being able to find the information of anything with only one hand. Computers benefit people because the can talk online with others. Also people have the advantage of learning about faraway places. Lastly you are able to find lots of information quickly and easily. Computers do benefit society. Furthermore, with computures people can talk online with others easily. All @ORGANIZATION1 students use the computer daily to video chat with friends or instant message parents! @ORGANIZATION2 discovered that computers keep families closer because they are able to see each other virtualy when someone is away. @PERCENT1 of @CAPS2 use their computers to talk with others online. One could see why computers are bad, but @CAPS5 they benefit a lot of people everyday. @CAPS1 walking into a room where people of all are learning about computers are helpful to @CAPS6 individual because the can learn about places. Computer says &quot;Computers are information in a compact &quot; @CAPS3 out of @CAPS4 people use the computer learn about far away places. The @LOCATION1 lives had found that using the computer to learn about far away places than using multiple , Some can use why books are to use, @CAPS5 omputers are. Lastly, computers are great because they teach @CAPS6 to have better, @PERCENT2 of people found their after using the computer for one haour. @PERSON2, @PERSON1, says &quot;The computer can help to develope stronger reflexes.&quot; @CAPS6 could see why computer slow reflexes, but @CAPS5 they mae them better. Computers benefit society greatly. Computers help people talk online with others. Also people can learn about faraway places. Lastly the computer strengthens hand eye coordination
9	Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 people use computers more? No they @CAPS2 not use computers more. Computers have many benefits to society but it also have many negitive effects on people who use them. People are spending more time on computers and less than exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends. First, people spend less time exercising. Most athletes have to stay fit and healthy to play in there sport. I am a wrestler and a baseball player but if I don't spend some time a day working out or staying active. I will be out of shape and weaker once my match or next game come along. I'm sure olympic athletes work out and stay active daily so they can be stronger and faster than anybody else out there so I don't know why people sit at home on the computer all day. Second, people don't take the time to enjoy nature. Nature is one of the most beautiful things on this planet. Wether you hiking a mountain of a lake, nature is all around you. I personaly love to hunt and fish. I take the time every sumer, @DATE1, fall,and sometimes winter to go out, enjoy nature, and have fun, and so do many other people in the world. Everyone who sits at home on the computer can't enjoy this gift that we have been given. Third, people won't take the time to with family or friends. If you the computer all day ther you can't go out and be active with your friends, or go for a bike ride with you brother. If you are on the computer you on family friend time that could be being used as a fishing trip or a walk in the woods. If you don't spend time with your family because of something you're doing on the computer, then you just a person. You won't valueable thing that you have in life you r family and you @CAPS2 always be able to make time them. Finally, @CAPS2 people use computers more? No, they @CAPS2 not use computers more. Computers take time away from exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends. There are good things about computers, but the less time you spend on them, the better it is for everyone.
9	@ORGANIZATION1, In @DATE1, more and more of the newest technology is being brought out to the public. Computers, @CAPS1-bars, telephones, and more are getting the most hi-tech softwares and machinery to @CAPS8 some of the most meraculous things happen. There is a cell-phone that allows you to turn of you lights in your house from thousands of miles today. This technology can be the best thing that has ever happend to the world. Some might argue that though. But I am here to argue The @CAPS2-sayers. With the new computers, people are able to talk with people all over the world. Also dreams can some true for people that never have the chance to follow @CAPS3. Also, questions that have been asked can now be answered. I have a number of cousins in @LOCATION3 who I only talk to if I go to visit @CAPS3 which is very rare. Because of some of The programs like @CAPS4, or @CAPS5 @CAPS6, I am able to converse with @CAPS7 cousins. Some people say That The @ORGANIZATION2 can @CAPS8 kids like me want to miss out on some quality-time with @CAPS7 family. Well, @CAPS7 brother is going to @CAPS10 in six months and I am going to want to talk with him. With phone companies haunting their costumers with scary prices, @CAPS7 family is not going to want to sit on The phone with him for @NUM1 hours and have to cut into their savings. On @CAPS7 @ORGANIZATION2, there is an application called i-chat which allows me to talk with @CAPS7 brother and see him as if he were home with me. @CAPS7 dad found out about @CAPS4 and he decided to try it out. As of now, he has reconnected with tons of his high-school Friends @CAPS13 get back in the game. Maybe you can find a special friend that you almost forgot about. Or you can find out what is happening with your sister who lives in @LOCATION1. The @ORGANIZATION2 also allows those less fortunate who can never afford a plane ride to discover a place they've always wanted to go. The internet offers virtual tours of places like the @LOCATION2 of even @LOCATION4- @CAPS14 places can be explored without stepping foot out of your house. Also @CAPS15, a website that offers millions of videos, incudes tourtorials for dances, sports, tricks, and more @CAPS13 you don't have to break into the bank for charged lessons. Another good thing about the @ORGANIZATION2 is it offers mostly reliable information. Sorry didn't get to finish @NUM2 paragraph &amp; conlusion.
8	Dear local newspaper, I've heard that you were taking a survey to see if people believe in computers or not. Well I'm someone who does because they can talk to there family and friends on sites like facebook, myspace, &amp; aim. They can also exercise on the internet because if they go to youtube, then they can find different types of positions that they can do. Today, over @NUM1 people use computers and it is like @PERCENT1 adults anfd @PERCENT2 children use computers which means that more kids today are doing athletic sports. The adults use computers for there work ability and in schools. At newspaper places, they need to have a computer just to type the daily papers and if there's no compers, then how ill the type there work. As people get home from wherever, and they didn't get the daily paper, the you can go online and look at it. For students, computers are so important to us because we get to talk to our friends and when we need to look up something, we just go to the internet. In some schools, they have really big books for different classes that they need to bring home. And that's bad for your back, so then schools came out with the books online. For those people who love sports, you can look up you favorite team and see if they won that weeks game. There is also vertual sport games that you can play for that is on the computer. When you first move somewhere oout of town, you can go to google and see where is a good town to live in and a good school system that you would want your child to go to. But there is so man things that you can do online and on computers. So thanks for letting me help you with your decision.
7	Dear Local Newspaper, I just heard that people are spending too much time on computers than with their families and friends. No @CAPS1 is not true just listen to the reasons why in a computer you can find people that you'r looking for. Also @CAPS1 can always help you on something that you need help on and you can do different kinds of activities. If you keep on reading you are going to see all the tipical reasons why I think that people are not spending much time on computers than with their families. (@NUM1) @CAPS2 reason why I think that people are not spending much time on computerr is because, the computer can help you look for a family member that your looking for or a friend.

11	Debates have come up on whether or not computers are benefiting or destroying society. Computers are only helping in aid in the growth of society. Computers allow people to interact with other people, see and discover other places and people, and teach hand-eye coordination. Computers are helping people more than they are hurting them. First of all, computers allow people to meet and interact with other people. There are many popular websites that allow people to chat and communicate at anytime. Before computers were invented in order to talk to someone you would have to meet with them face-to-face, or send them a letter and wait on awfuly time get a responce. Now people can simply type up an email and hit send. Just like that, their message is sent to another computer for others to read and enjoy. Another advancement computer technology has developed is picture sharing. All one has to do to display and show their pictures to everyone is done by simply hooking up a camera, uploading your pictures onto your computer, and posting them on a site like @CAPS1 or @CAPS2 bucket. Any in- the- @CAPS3 person would @CAPS3 that computers are very useful. Secondly, computers are important because they give people the ability to learn about and discover people &amp; places that are new to them. In the old days if you did not @CAPS3 about something or someone, like a movie, you @MONTH1 never find any info about them. Computers have internet websites and search like @ORGANIZATION1, that allow you to type anything and instantly find all the @CAPS4 information and pictures or that subject. These technological advances have given many people the general knowledge that they very well @MONTH1 need in any given situation. If you missed the best part of a you could easily go on a computer, look it up and importance of computers in every day society. Last of all, computer hand - eye coordination that is vital to every day life. Typing on a computer in leisure time is a skill that will be looked for everywhere. In fact, many employers @MONTH1 hire you based on your keyboarding skills, ones one is skilled enough they @MONTH1 even teach themselves to type without looking at the keyboard. Although computers are not meant to replace your friends, family, and @CAPS5 air, they are very important tools that give you skills you will use for the rest of your life. Any individual that is highly educated would see the pluses in computer usage. in conclusion, computers are vital in order to properly function in many situations. They allow you to chat and send pictures to loved ones, teach you about faraway people and places that you @MONTH1 not @CAPS3 about other wise, and help one improve on their hand - eye coordination. Computers are very useful peices of equipment.
0	The author concludes the story with this because gardens cannot grow with snow on the ground. So she she figurers when all the snow is melted she”ll try to grow another one. I feel as if she wasn’t  happy enough to grow another garden I think she should be more interested in growin it then disappointed.    
0	The narrater has that in with Paragraph becuse it all makes sence and it go'ss along together. The narrater says that when the guiss come out and the hibicus is budding is becuse it is ones more agian spring   
3	The author concludes the story with that passage to show the importance of the inspiration Saeng gets from the hibiscus plant. Saeng, throughout the story was comforted by the hibiscus plant because it reminded her of home. The plant during the winter metaphorically explains: @CAPS1 attitude towards her new country and her driving test; the hibiscus plant in the winter is not as beautiful in the bitter cold, but it adapts and survives, and returns to its beautiful state in the spring. Saeng is bitter about her new country and driving test, but is adapting, and will be inspired by the beautiful state of the hibiscus in the spring to try her test again. In conclusion, the author ended the story in that way to stress importance in the relationship between Saeng and the hibiscus plant.
2	The author ended the story with this paragraph because it shows change. The snow is melting represents change from cold to warm. The geese returning represents a new life as in coming back to something semi–new. Just like the author is going back to drivers ed. The hibiscus is budding represents growth. The author will be older and more knolageble and more skilled than before.
2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph of, “Winter Hibiscus”, because it takes us back to things that happened in the story. Saeng failed the test before. In the spring the hibiscus will be budding again. Saeng realized that many of the things she thought were strange, were almost familiar to her now. The calls of the snow geese were almost familiar to her. The snow melting will tell her that it is now spring. Some of the things that might happen as a result of spring coming might be that @PERSON1 will past the test. Her mother will be proud of her. Also, Saeng will start to become a customed to her new country and her new surrounding and stopremenising about her life back in Vietnam.
1	The reason the author concludes the story with this paragraph is because the author wanted to tell about about when saeng will take the test again. The author told the time with the season of the spring. In spring all the snows were melted and the geese and hibiscus has budding. And this paragraped make the reader to understand easyer. This is why the author include this paragraph in the story. 
0	The story ended with the author saying, &quot;when they come back, saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.&quot; The author concludes the story with this paragraph because Saeng is upset about spending @NUM1 on a plant that she had felt was different than the plant at home. She is stating that she is not going to take the test of buying one again until the geese return and the Hibiscus budds.
9	Computers effect a lot of people. I fully support the advances in technology. I support this because computers can let you talk to people that are faraway from you. Computers also teach hand-eye coordination. In addition, computers let you learn about countrys all over the word. Rapping it all up, electronics should keep advancing. Say your bestfriend moved to @LOCATION4. You won't see her but you can talk to her on the computer. Now in day there are a lot of websites that you can chat off at or you can also do a webcam chat like ovoo. For example, in seventh grade I moved from @LOCATION1 to @LOCATION2. I was so upset about leaving my old friends. Turns out I was fine. I just made more friends when I moved. I would make plans with my friends over facebook chating. Consequently, computers help a lot you keep in touch with friends all over the world. Computers build up your skills for everything. Hand-eye coordination is the biggest skill that computers teach anyone. When your watching an adult type most of them can type without looking at the keyboard. This is an example of hand-eye coordination. Hand-eye coordination is very helpful in sports. In basketball you should dribble and look ahead. Kinda like typing. As one can see computers help with hand-eye coordination. Google gives you answers to anything. If you have research to do most people use google and google is found on the computer. You can learn about @LOCATION3 or @LOCATION4 you name it you can type it in google, and you can learn everything about that country. For example, last year everyone had to pick a state and learn certain things about it. Most people used computers. Computers really are the best electronic in the world. There are many electronics that effect people. But, computers effect people the most. Computers let you talk to family and friends around the world. Also, computer teach you hand-eye coordination skills. Lastly, computer teach you about many countrys. In conclusion, computers should be advanced.
2	I believe that the author concludes the story with this paragraph because the paragraph helps bring to story to a closing. In the paragraph she is basically saying when the geese return and my flower is budding I'll be prepared enough to take the test. She'll be prepared because she'll be adapted enough and she'll have experienced enough just like the plant and the geese. She Is comparing her life to the lives of the geese and the life of her flower.
1	The author would conclude the story with that paragraph because she failed the test before and she wants to pass it. It makes you wonder if she will pass it or not.
2	In the story, &quot;Winter Hibiscus,&quot; by Minfong Ho, it concludes the story with a good ending. In the story the girl buys a Hibiscus that remainds her of home. She goes home &amp; tells her mother she failed her test but bought the plant. While she was planting it she seen geese and she was reminded of home. America was like home and she was happier. In the text she says, &quot;many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, almost familiar to her now.&quot; She is willing to give the test another try and is sure to pass it. America is now starting to feel a little more like home. 
2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because the story started out by Saeng failing the test, going out and buying a plant to comfort her and confessing to her mom. The plant related to her by the memories of her homeland and when she failed that test she felt very depressed and sad. She cried to show her pain, and bought a plant to cheer her up. As she told her mom she felt the pain again but, her mother made her favorite food and helped her plant the plant. She knew that it wasn’t like the old plant but, it was the thought and memories she knew that she couldn’t just give up, so when it came the right time she was going to try the test again. It relates because it helps the readers understand the story a little better and shows that she wasn’t going to just quit. Her mother was very understanding and when she goes to retake the test she will be prepared. That is how it relates back to the story.
0	I think he concluded the story with paragraph cause then do thing in the story and the report it so when the geese left they will come back and leave again so that what I think I take the test again means.
1	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because when every thing starts coming back she will take the test. That is why the author concludes the story with this parigraph
2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show a sense of determination that Saeng posesses. When Saeng comes back and shows her mother the hibiscus plant, she is very upset, with tears in her eyes.Her mother at first is disappointed in her for buying the plant, but is then understanding when she realizes that Saeng was distraught. The mother offers to help Saeng plant the hibiscus, which comforts Saeng a little bit, helping her gain the determination she needs to recover. The story says “Almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now.” This quote states that Saeng realizes that things at home can be the same as things in her new country. The author uses the term “familiar” to express that Saeng is starting to accept the fact that some things @MONTH1 be different, but she will eventually get used to it, making her view on life more positive.  
0	Why the author concludes the story with this paragraph is because in the paragraph there is a lot said that is the main part of this story. For example all the names and talks about the seasons and there comparisions and differences and it talks abouts different buddings like when you get your mids your nuggets and headies of the plant. Because hibiscus is a new form of some nice @CAPS1.
1	He states this as the conclusion because it shows the faith that she has in the flower and how it will bring her luck for her up coming test. She feels like the familiar flower is out of place as she is and they can relate to somethings.
2	I believe the author concludes the story with Saeng because it shows when she is reminded of home. I believe she thought she could pass the test when the flower was blooming and reminded her of home. For example, Saeng mumbled, “Not like the kind we had before.” This suggest to me that she was probably home sick. Then when spring comes and it blooms the flower could give her the strength to pass the test. This is why I believe the author ended with this paragraph.
10	Dear residents of @LOCATION1, @CAPS1 has come to my attention that there has been some controversy about whether or not computers are a good thing and/or helpful to society. I strongly believe that computers are a very helpful resource that make day to day life easier. Computers can help us in so many ways including making learning easier, helps students do better in @CAPS4, nad serves as a great teaching tool. One reason that I support computers is because they make learning easier. You might ask hao a screen and a keyboard can make learning easier, @CAPS1 sounds crazy, but its true! Let's say you're a middle @CAPS4 student that has been assigned to write a paper on a designated topic; @CAPS2 instead of spending hours upon hours looking for the right information in a library, you could just google search what your topic in and @CAPS3! You have exactly what you need to know in front of you within seconds, prettty cool right? Still don't believe computers are helpful? What if I told you @CAPS1 allowed students to do better in @CAPS4? That's right, computers allow students to do better in @CAPS4. Websites such as edline allow teachers to post their students grades very quickly. How is this helpful? When you take a quiz your treacher has to grade over @NUM1 quizzes! And with things like absentees, weekends and vacations, the day you get your quiz back gets delayed further. Sometimes kids don't get their quizzes back for two weeks after they took them! By the time you get @CAPS1 back @CAPS1's time for a chapter test with @PERCENT1 of your grade and you just found out you didn't do @CAPS2 on one of the sections! This lowers your ability to do @CAPS2 on the test. But if your grade was posted on the internet days before , you will have more time to study and know what to study and you will do @CAPS2 on the test. As you can see, computers are very helpful for students, but are they good for teachers too? The answer is yes, computers are a good teaching tool. Has this ever happened to you? No matter how much your teacher explains to you, @CAPS1 just seems like there are speaking another language? @CAPS2 what if they showed you a cool video on youtube explaining @CAPS1? Would you learn better with a visual in front of you? I sure would. Computers are also great for teachers because @CAPS1 gives them the ability to email other teachers if there is a problem and get the latest information about the @CAPS4 and what's going on. Do you understand why computers are useful, now? I hope you realize how useful computers are because they make learning easier, allow students to do better in @CAPS4, and are a great learning tool. These are only some of the many reasons computers are useful and I hope you keep using them in our community.
1	The arthur uses it because Saeng got confidence back from planting the hibiscus and everything that happened that year. So now shes ready and that’s what the arthur wanted the reader to figure out.
3	the author concludes the story this way because Saeng failed the test, the hibiscus comforts her, and she feels she is similar to the geese. For example, Saeng says “I-I failed the test.” She has admitted to failing the test and is upset about it and wants to “take that test again.&quot; @CAPS1, Saeng says,&quot; And that rich sweet scent- that was familiar, too, “while describing the hibiscus. The familiarity of the plant comforts her and will allow her to build up the courage to “take the test again.” Finally, at one point Saeng thinks to herself, &quot;the quiet repetition of season opon season, almost familiar to her now. Like the geese.” Saeng feels similar to the geese in this way and this allows her to decide to take the test “ when the snow melts and the geese return.” The author concludes the story strongly, describing how Saeng failed the test, how the hibiscus comforts her and she feels similar to the geese.
1	I think the author ends the story with this paragraph because she will be reminded of her homeland and going home. The reason I say that is because the geese are returning home and she wants to. Also the hibiscus will be budding in the wild just like back home
1	I think that the author concludes the story with this paragraph by teaching Saeng how to be confident and vow silently, In order to teach her more lessons because of the fact she failed the test in the middle of the passage Saeng tells her mother that when the snow is gone in the spring time she will retake the test that she failed. Her mother was very upset when she found out that Saeng failed the test the first time.
1	They probably ended it like that to build suspense of leave the reader on a good note because someone @MONTH1 think things are going to get better for them and Saeng @MONTH1 get her license. They @MONTH1 get more money.
3	 In” Winter Hibiscus,” by Minfong Ho, the main character, saeng , undergos many obstacles as she tries to adapt to her new country , which is very different from her home. The author chooses to end the story, as,” When they come back, saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding , then I will take that test again.” @CAPS1 the author meant to end the story in this fashion to ensure the reader that saeng has found new hope , which symbolized by the hibiscus flower.Now along with  budding  new hope, the flower also carries a sentimental value ,about her home .Sometimes ,the best way to overcome your obstacles is to embrace them, as she did in the greenhouse ,then   that leaves room to start anew.
1	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to snow that just because you fail once you  shouldn’t give up.  From  what  was  expressed  it  the  paragraph it  was  implied to me that Saeng  will become  stronger by spring and be able to pass the test .
2	The author concludes this story with this paragraph because all things have routins and things they have to do to survive. The geese fly @CAPS1 for the warm months so they don’t die from the cold. The flower dies in the winter is brought back to life in the spring. This pertains to Saeng because when the geese and the flowr come back she will take the test of trying to fit in, in her new country, That is why the auther chose this to end the story.
2	In the story, “Winter Hibiscus”, the author ends with the last specified paragraph, “When they came back…then I will take that test again.” because it leaves many un-answered questions the reader might have. The reader then might want to read her next piece of work. Basically, the last paragraph drows attention to the reader. many of the unanswered questions revolve around, “I failed the test.”. We also do not know “her gentle grandmother”, “mrs.Lambert”, and “home”. Another reason the author might end the story with that paragraph is to have a effect on the reader. The reader is left to only assume and imagine what things are to come. Will she pass the test? Will she go home? What will happen? All we know is, ”when the snow melts, and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again.” most likely the author ended the story with the paragraph for dramatic effect for the reader. This is why, I believe the author of “Winter Hibiscus” ended with the specified paragraph.
1	I think that she ended the story like that because it means that she is getting used to all the seasons. “In the spring when the snow melts and the geese return and this hisbiiscus is budding, then I will take the test again.” She will and take the test once its not cold anymore so she will wait until the geese come again which will be spring by then. I think that she is also trying to say that when the snow melts and the geese are there again she will have taken the test and pass it. This is I think she ended it like this because how they mean something to her.
8	@ORGANIZATION1, Computers have great benefits to our society. Whether it is because it helps people get their work done. Or it allows people to communicate without telephone numbers. Maybe it's because it helps students study. With any of these reasons, computers are really benefiting our society. Have you ever had a paper assigned one day and due the next? If you think back what had helped you complete the paper? Most likley it was a computer. In a recent survey @PERCENT1 of college students say that they would not be getting the good grades that the were getting if they didn't have a computer. But, computers don't just help students, they can also help adults in the working community. I know that I have made friends over the years that have moved away and that I have lost touch with. With a computer it is easier to find those people and start talking to them. With different types of programs, you could most likley find anyone. Whether it's @CAPS1, @CAPS2, @CAPS3, or @CAPS4. Nine out of ten adults said that they found a lof of their highschool friends thanks to the computers. Furthermore, computers are a way for students to study. Students could find search engines and reasearch a paper. Or they could play educational games. With a computer if a student forgot his or her homework they could most likley use a computer to find out what the work was. When I went to the middle school to survey, @NUM1 out of @NUM2 students said that they would check to see if it was on the computer before asking a friend. So as you can see computers have benifits to our society today. Three just happen to be that they help people get work done faster, they help keep you in touch with friends and they help students to study.
2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it shows how everything is changing and adapting to the change. Saeng decides that with this change, she can also adapt to her new life by going back and passing the drivers test. The hibiscus also represents how something also from her homeland has come to america and must now survive. When it begins to bud, Saeng will begin to start adapting to america by passing her drivers test. It’s all about trying to become accustomed to changes. When Saeng feels bad for failing, that’s why something from her past is such a comfort to her.
3	By ending the story with the idea of retaking a test in the spring, the author sets a feeling of starting fresh and perservering . for example , when the author says” when the snow melts and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding ,”she show the idea of starting a fresh new life in the spring by returning to their home and the hibiscus is starting fresh by  budding again. This is why spring is when saeng wants to start fresh and retake the test. The paragraph also shows that saeng, like the hibiscus, is perservering. The hibiscus is perservering by making it through the winter and blooming again while saeng   is perservering by retaking the test. The author ends with this paragraph to show that saeng is not going to give up. 
1	The author concluded the story with that specific paragraph because Saeng feels most comfortable taking the test again when what she explained happens. Saeng misses where she came from alot. She promised herself that she would take the test again when that happens. With Saeng saying that it makes you wonder why she wont take the test again the snow melts, the geese return and the hibiscus is budding. It makes her feel really comfortable when that does happen.
2	The concluding paragraph explains her next goal. She had to take a test but failed it. Paid over nineteen dollars for the plant. It reminded her of her old home. She will have confident in the spring because the plant grew to its new home so she will grow to her new home also.
1	The author concludes the story with his par paragraph because. She will take the test in the spring and she will do her best. She said “I-I failed the test,” Saeng said. By failing a test. doesn’t mean. that its not end of everthing. She will have more confidence next time she take the test.
3	The author concludes the story, “winter hibiscus,” with this paragraph of the story, for several relevant reasons. By concluding the story, in this way it shows Saeng’s growth, and more willingness to strive, and do her best. When she says she will take the test again, it shows her gain of confidence, and her beginning to gain comfort in the place that is not her home country. She is now striving and working toward doing her best to become successful. And she is making the very best of the given situation. The author is trying to give more depth and meaning to the study in this way. Saeng went from being nervous and worried when saying, “I-I failed the test,” to now setting a goal for herself to take it again, the time the bud blooms next year. Basically, the author did a full circle, by ending the story in this way. From speaking of the test, to sharing the flower experience with her mother, to state that she will re-take the test, next year. 
2	The auther concludes with that paragraph because. it shows that despite her sorrow and discomfort, Saeng is able to remain hopeful. In the story, Saeng sees a hibiscus which makes her very homesick for her native country of Vietnam. The reader also leans that she failed a test and feels at of place. However, the hibiscus symbolizes hope and comfort. The auther chooses to conclude with that paragraph because despite Saeng’s hardships, the hibiscus helps her realize that she can overcome he obstacles and be hopeful of the future.
1	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because when saeng and her mother go back to there home where the flowers were more beautiful than the flowers where there living now. She wants to plant flowers that’s going to remind her of her home. In the story saeng mother said that it’s flowers aren’t as pretty, but it’s strong enough to make it through the cold months here this winter hibiscus her mother wanted her to know that the only thing that maths is that the plant can last threw winter.
2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because the author wanted to show just cause saeng failed that test don’t mean she giving up. she said when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then she will take it again. what the author means that right now she has failed but over time she can study and learn more to get ready to re take it. And by the time she ready to take the test the snow with have went away every should be hot out the birds come back and the flower is growing fine. she  will take it. And how author ended it lets us know she going to take it but how he use the words let us know that she will not only take it but pass it too.
0	The author concludes the story with that because the hibiscus started budding and she’s happy now. So she’s saying after the geese come back and the snow melt, she’s to do all over again.
6	Computers do benefit are society. They have changed the world alot. You can do many things on the internet. On the computer, you can chat with people everywhere. The computer helps the world. These are ways how computers do benefit our society. There are many things you can do on the internet. You can play games with people. You can talk to people on certain websites. You can look up vaction spots. If your tired of being home, then just go on the internet. These are things you can do on the internet. On the computer, there are many settings. Out of all of them, chatting is the best. You can be playing a game and still chat. If you chatting with someone, you can still chat with another person. You can chat with people from across the world. This is why chatting is the best setting. Computer helps the world in many ways. It helps kids if they need to research something. It helps the cops catch the bad people. The computer helps parents get from their children by vaction ads. This is has the computer helps the world. The computer does benifit our society. It has change the world. You can do many things on it. On the computer, you can chat with people from anywhere. The computer helps the world everyday. This is how the computer benifits our society.
8	I think that computers have positive effects on peole. People can find out important news online, and you can connect with people you don't see often. Also, you can order anything in the world online. These are three reasons why I believe computers have a positive effect on people. Computers inform people about important news. If there is a blizzard people can find out ahead of time and stock up on food. If there is a burglar going around, people can find out, and lock all doors and windows. And by knowing all this information, it helps helps people plan events, like birthday parites. Finding out important news is very helpful, and conveniant. And @PERCENT1 of people, are less to inconveniances, if they know the news. Another way computers have a positive effect on people is by allowing them to connect with people they don't see often. This provides an easy way to share events tha have taken place, and just have some time to talk face to face. With video chat, you can show off new , or newborn baby. You can share you want with people you barely see. Experts say that freindships last longer if you talk to each ohter often. and with computers, this is possible. A third way computers help out is allowing you to order anything in the world online. If you need a japanese doing for someone in ohio, you can order it online. If you're are old, and can't go to the grocery store anymore, you can order then online. I have seen that people who can order everything online, don't have to do a lot of driving, and this saves time, money, and gas. This is also very convendent and is less stressful then waithing in lines to purchase on item. These are just three ways htat computers have had a positive effect on people. the are that you can find out important news, you connect with people you don't see ofte, and you can order anything in the world that's why I believe comptuers have a positive effect on people.
2	The reason the author of the story “Winter hibiscus” ends it the way she does is so that we know we can never give up. She fails her driving test the first time and me being less than a year from taking the test myself and no matter how many time I fail the test I will never give up. We need to preserve through every problem we go through in life. If we don’t and we just give up we will never get anything done in life. She vows in the spring and when the hibiscus is budding she will take the test again. I hope I pass my driving test the first time just like I did the learner’s permit test. Also you can’t give up on anything at all even something small like working if you stop working you will loose your job. Never give up.
0	the author added that sentence to the story to show how much Saeng cared about the snow and the plants. She says that she much rather do gardening then school work. She loves planting new things.
3	The reason why the  author concludes the story with that paragraph is because it shows that saeng is starting to expect the new place she is in. Throughout  the story it says how she feels out of place just like the “ winter hibiscus”. Then later in the story she says how ,”many of the things that she thought of as strange before had become , through quite repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now .” That quote means that most things she thought of as strange she is now getting used to slowly, which means is adapting. So, the reason why she says the last paragraph is to show that when everything changes back to spring the geese come back, and the hibiscus is budding ,”then she will take that test again.”therefore  the author puts the conclusion on the story because it shows how  she will adapt as well as the hibiscus.  
3	The writer leaves the reader with a sense of hope for the future by concluding with this paragraph. Even though the narrator buys the plant in sadness, after she fails her driving test and is missing her home, it is still a symbol of hope. She means that when the flower is blooming, her hope will be also and she will try again, maybe this time with success. Right now she @MONTH1 be sad and scary, but she knows that things will work out, and she will be fine. She is finally settling into her new life and says that “many of the things she had thought of as strange before had become almost familiar to her now.” She means that even though she misses her homeland so much, she is slowly getting used to her new home, and her new life. And maybe by the spring she will be happy and comfortable here, comfortable enough to try her driving test again. The hibiscus represents both the longing for the past and the hope for the future.
2	I think the author concludes the story with this paragraph because it shows that saeng is most comfortable when she is surrounded by things from her homeland. She thinks she will be ready to take the test when she sees the ducks again, and when the hibiscus begins to bud. Narrator says ‘’A saebya ledges tall and high, had surrounded their garden…’’ @CAPS2 is evidence that Saeng had hibiscus in Vietnam, and the story of the well reminds her of it. The narrator also says,’’ Overhead, a flock of @CAPS1 geese, their faint looks clear and -yes-familiar to Saeng now,’’ @CAPS2 proves that the geese symbolize @CAPS3 home also.     
2	I belive the author concludes with that quote for an assortment of reasons. One is to show that the charecter isn’t just going to give up, that her failing wasn’t the end for her. This shows sorting like morale of never giving up. It feels as the character is referring to the hibiscus as sensely. “The hibiscus will be budding”   which means that she herself will branch out and learn more. By the spring time she would have learned enough and experienced enough to try to pass the test again. The hibiscus also reminds her of her home. When she will look at it she will find the courage to pull through and to face her challenges like her test.The ending quotealso wraps up the story.It also shows the charecters will of not giving up and to always try.
2	The author uses this concluding paragraph to draw the whole story together. She speaks of the driving test, geese, and the hibiscus plant three subjects found in the story. when she says &quot;when the snow melts and the geese return&quot;, she is referring to the geese mentioned when she says &quot;She lifted her head and watched as their distinctive V was etched against the evening sky&quot;. She went through a change, much like the geese do every winter. She realizes &quot;that many of the things that she had thought of as strange befere had become...familiar to her now&quot;. We all have to go through changes, Saeng just had a bigger one. 
0	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because the author wrote the same thing that it had in the paragraph and he wrote it in his story but added a little more details to it and problems and things.
1	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show how Saeng is respectful and how her feelings miss her homeland. First example when “Saeng vowed silently to herself” it shows how she respect and miss her homeland. It tells that she want to try again about her failure in the past. The last example when she want to overcome her failure in the past. The last line of the paragraph say “then I will take that test again”. It says she want another. Chance on her life. These are the example of the author concludes the story with this paragraph.
2	The author had concluded this story with this paragraph to make it as if they were on a clean slate like they had started over. So the past no longer haunts them. Saeng sounds as if she has a bit of relief after she takes her mom the plate. I believe that she feels better because at the end of the paragraph she sounds sure of herself. She sounds certain she sounds as if she want to start over because she says &quot;when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again”. To me she sounds like a brand new person. Who has forgotten about the past.
9	Dear Local Newspaper, Computers have a humongous positive effect on people. I support advances in technology. It's @DATE1; we shouldn't be finsing information in books or writing everything by hand anymore. Life has gotten easier for everyone. Everyone can use the computer for communication with friends or family. We are able to learn things quicker by using computers. Working citizens use computers to help them with important jobs! Everything is done on computers! Computers serve as a great source of communication. Having a @CAPS1, @CAPS2, or @CAPS3 account allows you to chat with people all over the world. It's much easier to talk to someone online for long periods of time because you won't have to pay for phane minutes! Even @CAPS4 chats are avaibale for computer users. Having a @ORGANIZATION1 or @CAPS5 allows you to do a video chat with someone. It makes you feel like thay are actually there in the room with you. If you have a close friend who moved across the country, then these ways to communicate would be very helpful to you! You cant have these accounts without a computer; therefore, we need computers! Computers have made our generation very intelligent. We can easily look up facts about anything on the computer. Now, if there's something we're curious about, we can just look it up on google. In the past, we wouldn't feel like looking in a book so we waid forget about it. Kids could get help with homework online if they are too shy to ask another person. At this point in time, we could even take online college courses! Being able to go to college at home can really come in handy in some people. Computers help us with our education. Adults who go to work everyday really need to use computers! people working in the medicine field, use computers to keep track of all their patients. Now @CAPS6 use computers to organize lesson plans and print out reminders for their students. Scientists use computers to do research on things for their ecperiments. Engineers use programs on the computers to help design what they are going to build. Computers wvwn allow you ti advertise your small business or company to the whole entire world. Computers have a really positive effect on jobs in our society, which is a good thing for our economy! Computers benifit us physically, mentally, and socially. Certain computer games can improve our hand eye cordination. We can learn about many things from computers! They really make us more intelligent! Computers give us a way to communicate with long distance friends and family. Websites like @CAPS7-@CAPS8 even give adulsts a chance to find their soulmate online! The positive effects of computers on people are infinite, but we need to learn not to take them for granted.
1	The author ends the story with this paragraph because the plant is noticed when she is coming home after felling the driving test. So she says when everything is right. She will take the test again. The driving test not important to her she won’t pas it though so she wants to go take it again when the plant she bought is budding and at its best point.
3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it shows how much Saeng has grow because of this experience, and how determined she is. This last paragraph afters a sudden happy ending to a rather sad story, but gives the reader role knowing the mom character is confident enough to try again. The whole story was filled with sadness about Saeng’s family having to move to a new country and start all over. However, the one thing that acts as an escape for them, is their gardening. In Vietnam, they seemed to have a nice garden and enjoyed having with it very much. Now that their in @LOCATION2, their garden and the plants in it remind them of that homeland, and how there life used to be. Although saddened by not passing her driving test, Saeng finds a plant that makes her happy and seems to rejuvinate her how of passing the test. The final paragraph seals the deal, as it shows that she is again confident in herself because of the happy memories that she is thinking about.
1	The author used the last paragraph because the hibiscus is a symbol for saeng. It shows that she will be ready when spring comes. When the plant is ready to bud, she will have faith about taking the test. She'll probably want to take care of the plant before she takes the test. When the plant bads, saeng won’t have to take care of it anymore.
1	I think the author concludes the story with the paragraph because Saeng is saying when the good time came back around she will try for the test again because She had failed it. for example on page @NUM1 at the top She &quot; I-I falled the test&quot; thats why i think the author concludes this with the Story because it was important to Saeng to past the test in the good time of season Spring. 
2	“Winter Hibiscus “is about a girl saeng, who moved from Vietnam to the @ORGANIZATION1. After she fails her driver’s test. She walks home and finds a hibiscus. “She closed her eyes and breathed in, deeply. The familiar fragrance filled her lungs, and saeng could almost feel the light strands of her grandmother’s long gray hair…” She goes to a flower shop to see if it can be purchased. She pays a lot of money for the plant because it is rare and valuable. It is special to her because she used to have hibiscus plants in Vietnam. She brings the plant home &amp; tells her mom that it reminds her of Vietnam. The mom says that it reminds her of Vietnam too. The mom is not happy with how much saeng paid for it. She plants it in her garden.” When the hibiscus was lowered in the ground, a flock of geese flew by.”When the hibiscus returns in the spring,  saeng will take her driver’s test again. In the spring, all the flowers start to bud and bloom. Everything is new again. saeng will have a new chance to pass her test.
2	I think that the included that because she is compareing her slef as a flower. When she grows again like a flower she will go prove to past that test. She’s saying there always a second chance. She want to tell everyone that it’s to miss or a misake. For an example “they said there were many of things that she had thought of strangely, season up seson.
0	The author concludes the story like that because she wants every body to know how she feels about the hibiscus. She felt like the hibiscus was a wondeful plant. She described it as &quot;smooth and cool toward the end of the first page. When she first the plant back in Vietnam she thought that is just grew wildly. Then when she saw it in the United States she was suprised that it grew in a pot. For example she desribed the the smell of the hibiscus as a &quot;sweet scent.” @CAPS1, this why she is concluded the story like this; because of how felt about the plant.
0	The author concludes the story with that statement because it shows Saeng passion for gardening. How she’s willing to take the test is to see if her plants can grow when spring comes around and the hibiscus starts to bud she will attempt to grow it which shows how anxious Saeng is for gardening and to try and get the hibiscus to grow during the spring.
1	The author concludes the story with this to mean that when everything is back to normal and beautiful that when Saeng will take the test. She did this to show that Saeng is a spring person and that she likes working in the garden in the spring. Also it means that Saeng feels that she does better in school during the spring time.The author concludes the story with this to mean that when everything is back to normal and beautiful that when Saeng will take the test. She did this to show that Saeng is a spring person and that she likes working in the garden in the spring. Also it means that Saeng feels that she does better in school during the spring time.
3	Change and disappointment are enough to over-come. Some people have an arid fear of change. For Saeng the main character from “winter Hibiscus,” change comes in the form of a move to @LOCATION1. Everything around her is different and new. Coupled with disappointment of failing her driver's exam, the feeling of living helpless overwhelms her. After buying a winter hibiscus plant, she vows to take the test again when it blooms in the spring. The resiliance of the winter flower and the memories it represents inspire seng to try again.
10	Dear Newspaper, I often think about the effect of technology on humans. The human race has discovered many things but our biggest advance is technology. New machines are robots are built all the time, and our knowledge of machines and artificial minds is rapidly growing. The most widely used machine is the computer. People use it for all sorts of things, communucation, awareness and learning and entertainment. Some experts are concerned that people spend too much time on computers and it couldn't agree more. Computers maybe useful but they are over used. People spend more time staring at the screen than exercising and interacting with friends and family. Computers are also not always dependable or safe. First of all, the biggest computer users are adolesents. Young adults spend hours on websites like @CAPS1, @CAPS2, and @CAPS3 communicating with their friends. At their young age, exercise is very important. Obesity in children from lack of exercise is becoming very common, and its because young people are glued to their computer screens. The averange child need @NUM1 minutes of exercise a day, and many have very little none. I say the computers are ok, but only in small doses. The growing mind and body needs to move and exercise. If internet use among children and teenagers is not cut back, some worry that there will be a lot more health problems in the future. Although it is very east to quickly communicat through the internet, it can sometimes do more harm than good. Kids who spend hours @CAPS4 or emailing their peers spend less time with their families. I've heard parents say they barely see their kids because their always either doing homework. Also, @CAPS5 to @CAPS5 conversations are fading. Because of the internet, people no longer need to get together and talk, @CAPS6 turn on their computers, which is a waste of energy. Why not just go see your friend @CAPS6 of typing all day? Lastly, computers have just as many disadvantages as they do advantages. There are plenty of dangers out there in @LOCATION1. Online predators lurk as many comers, and your personal information and identity can easily be stolen. The risk of any of these things happening is very high. Its better safe than sorry. So, if you think about it, we really don't need computers to survive. You need your exercise, don't blow it off for online chat. Also, its very important to interact and be part of your family, and less internet use will cut down the risk of identity theft, or any other problem or virus. It's your time now. Get outside have @CAPS5 to @CAPS5 conversation with a friend and internet with your family. You can be healthy, happy, and safe without constantly typing any at the keyboard.
0	I think the author wanted to express Saeng when she took a vowed and to express the way he felt. When the statement was made that also I think it was to make readers feel interest in it but mainly to help understand.
2	For shadowing, future reference, continus behavoir-all are reasons why that is the last paragraph. Well they are for shadowing because they are telling you something that she says she is going to do in the future. She is telling you what she plants to do in the future so she refrencing from what she plans to do in the future she is keeping the behavior from before up so she says she will something again next year so that is why I said continus behavior. She said ‘’when they come back,Saeng vowed silently to herself in the spring, when the shows melt and the geese return and this  hibiscus is buddin, then I will take that test again. So For shadowing, future, reference, continus behaviors are very good reasons why I thing that what she says is good and those three things best describe what she said and what she said that snow as going to do next year.     
2	I believe that the author concludes the story like this to show a sense of continuation in life. In the story Saeng takes a “test” and fails. She goes out and buys a hibiscus plant for well over what she what she should have paid for it. Her test is to try to get over the memories of her real “home” that Saeng is now only cries about when she thinks of it. To Saeng the plant represents memories and a life that she once had, but no longer does, however does want it back. Her vowe to herself is that when the geese come flying back over her that she will go back to the greenhouse that reminds her so much of her home and try once again to say “home” without breaking down, and without having something extremely expensive.
3	In 'Winter hibiscus' by @CAPS1 Ho, the narrator never clearly indicates what test Saeng has failed. However, through subject matter and word choice it is clear that the test is not only important to Saeng and her mother, but also to her new life in @LOCATION1. Throughout the story saeng's longing for her homeland is over powering. The flood of memories that came back to her when she purchases the hibiscus, are obviously painful and part of her everyday life. Saeng is working is working hard to keep her memories of Vietnam alive, while knowing that she must learn to live the @CAPS2 customs and lifestyle. There are somethings she dosent need to change, like passing the test. Saeng realizes that she can use these memories to keep her spirits alive, she can use them as motivation. This is why the last sentance of the story is so impowering, because she has learned to use the @NUM1 things together memory and change, ”when [] this hibiscus is budding I will take that test again”     
2	The author chose to conclude the story with that paragraph to show that the girl had adapted to her new country. Saeng missed her home. It was hard for her to say her country’s home without crying. &quot;It’s not like the wind we had at-at-.&quot; She also spent @MONEY1 on a plant because it remind her of back at home. One could inter she adapted because she was familiar with the season change and it states when the geese return she is going to take the test again.
1	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because it makes Saeng feel more at home. For example it say, “the snow melt, and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again. “I think the author says this because all the thing in that sentence remind her of home. For example the plant the geese are things she had at home, so when winter is over she will feel better and take the test.  
1	The reason why the author ended with Saeng vowed iS because she is very commited. She failed the first time but know she really want to pass it so she is waiting until the snow melt and @CAPS1 geese return and this hibiscus is buddin @CAPS2 she will come back
0	I think that the author concluded the story like that because of who throw out the whole Story the plot was in the winter. She might wanted to try it in a different season to see if she might to better with the whot setvation. That is why I think the author concluded the story like that.  
1	I think the author finish the story with this paragraph for the following reasons. Saeng really means she will take the test in spring. I say that because she says when the snow melt and geese return meaning next spring she will take the test again. She is saying with confidence because she started to add more. For example, she added “hibiscus is budding.” Saeng is determined to past the test just by what she is saying. This is why it was the last paragraph and what she meant by it.
1	The author concludes the story with in the spring when the snows melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is  budding then I will take that test again, because she is saying there will be a new year. For example he failed it the first time she will wait until she tries again. Another example she just want to try until she get her driving license.
4	Dear Newspaper, I think computers are a good thing, people use computers for buissness. Computers allow you to interact with people far away. They also allow you to do research. That is why I think computers are good. Computers can be used for many different things. They can be used for buissness. Some people work at home on computers. They can also be used to interact with people far away. You can interact with someone who you don't see on a daily basis. Computers can also be used for research. You can do research on a school project or on other buissnesses you interact with. Computers are good. Some people use computers for buissness. You can also interact with people far away. You can even do research on a computer that is why computers are good.
0	In this story Saeng shows her mother how pasionate she is with planting and her pasionate for plants. The author includes the paragraph in the story so that it can show how the charact Saeng feels about her planting. One reason why this shows that she has passion for planting is because it says “I will try this test again” meaning that if she is doing something that she enjoys doing then she will try it again and again until she is fully pleased.
3	The authors concludes that in the paragraph. I think he concluded that in these because it shows alot of confidence about her. For example when she said, “then I will take that test again”. It sounded very confident and made it where she can want to try if she or he fails the first time.
1	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show that she has not given up on her dreams.
2	Hope, a new beginning, adjustment-all are reasons why the speaker concludes by saying “when they come back, in the spring, when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again” That hibiscus flower gives that girl hope because it remind her of her grandmother and back home, how wonderful things were back there, and by the flower blooming, she realize it could wear out there too. She’ll also have a new beging in the spring, by spring she should adjust to her surrounding and have new friends, things to do, and new memories to look back on, that looking backabout flawall won't be as bad the flower will bring her hope and comfort with her adjustment.
1	The author is saying that she’s not doing nothing intell it is a nice day outside. Also she want it to be not that cold but not that not for she can come out and play with her children. Then she said she will take her test again for a nice day outside for her.
2	The author ends the story with this conclusion to show that @PERSON1 is very passionate about connecting her life in the United States, to how life was in Vietnam and bringing them together somehow. In the story, @PERSON1 talks about how she misses home and how she is still trying to adapt to her new life away from the home she knew, when saeng says that she has failed the test and wants to take it again, she means that she wants to show that she can survive in the United States without disappointing her mother. When saeng spent @MONEY1 on a plant, her mom was in disbelief because Saeng knows how hard it is to survive. When the conclusion says,”I will take the test again,” it shows that Saeng is willing try to make it in the United States from Vietnam, proving that she can make a better life for herself and her family by working hard. While still keeping trditions in Vietnam alive. Saeng simply wanted to make her new home feel like Vietnam by buying a plant she knew her mother would like.
1	The author might have concluded this story because it like a downfall. Which mean like right now he’s at the bottom and got to make it to the top. He is going to start over and take the test again, but thes time he is not going to fail.
1	The author had concluded her paragraph like this for emotion. This last paragraph gives emotion to know she can’t garden do to winter. In the winter time all of her plants die for the season. 'The, author is just saying saeng is coming back. After the snow, frosts and cold weather is gone Saeng will come next season so she can continue with her gardening, plants and soil. As said “I will take the test again&quot; saeng.  Meaning saeng will come back and take the test of effort with her gardening and her mother next time/ next season when her starts to grow again.
1	I think that the author concludes which paragraph as his ending because thats what that is what the girl is going to be doing for the following year that is going to pass and still be with her mother helping her out in the garden. Without no friends just let in her mom
3	The author ends the story with this paragraph to show how Saeng has found from hibiscus plant. Like the  plant Saeng is going to overcome an obstacle. She will try the driving test again and the plant will overcome. The harsh   ,blutal winter months. The plant will bloom in the spring and show its restrency during adversity. Saeng   will also overcome the  adversity  she faced when failed her driving test and realizing how much she missed her homeland. Saeng too, in a sense will bloom in the spring. The winter, representing her despise  and homesickness, will not present her from living happly and taking the test over.The hibiscus reminds her of the. The story ends with the paragraph to show how the “ Winter Hibiscus” has taught her something about overcoming obstacles.
10	Dear Local Newspaper, I have been asked to write a letter stating @CAPS5 opinion on the effects, computers have on people. Some experts have been worried people are not spending enough time outside, but most people are not spending enough time outside, but most people support advances in technology. During this time, computers are becoming more and more popular. They are very helpful in many ways. They allow you to learn new things, are very helpful for school and work, and they can keep family an friends connected. Computers have a positive and helpful effect on people. To begin, computers help you learn new things. If ever there is a question no one knows the answer to &quot;@CAPS1 it!&quot; @CAPS1 along with many other search engines are an easy way to find what you are looking for. For example, one day a few of @CAPS5 family friends come over we were eating dinner. the discution lead to the question of &quot;who is the @CAPS6 that plaies @CAPS3 in the @CAPS4?&quot; @CAPS5 little sister typed &quot;@CAPS6 of @CAPS3 in the movie the @CAPS4&quot; and @CAPS9! There it is @PERSON1. Just like that, computers help to get questions answered fast. Computers also help you learn new things like typing skills. just learning how to work them is a new skill. A recent poll shows that @PERCENT2 of people in nursing homes who learn how to use the computer have much better brain function. Although, there are much stronger reasons as to why computers have a positive effect on people. Furthermore, computers help people with work and school. Computers help you send e-mails for work, make slide shows for presentations, and keep calendars so you can be organised and on time. @PERCENT1 of people use computers in some way to benifit in work.
2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it shows that saeng is going to accept her new home and reconize the similarities from her old home and hold memories close to help her overcome obstacles that she is facing in life. &quot;I've seen this kind blooming along the lake. It's flowers arn't as pretty, but it`s strong enough to make it through the cold months here, this winter hibiscus. That's what matters.” This sets similarities from their old home to their new home. This shows that things do change but they are also the same. This leads to the conclusion because this is where Saeng relizes that she will always have the memories of her old home and will use them to help her overcome the troubles shes going through.  
3	The author ends the story the way she did to show how Saeng and the hibiscus plant are a like and how Saeng will overcome her obstacle when the plant overcomes its obstacle. Saeng’s obstacle is adjusting to her new life and the first step in that is passing her driver’s test. The reader knows she has to pass because Saeng tells her mother , “I-I failed the @NUM1]. The hibiscus must make it through the winter, it also has to adjust to new surrounding to survive, just like Saeng. The mother says to Saeng,”… but its strong enough to make it through the cold month here, this winter hibiscus.Thats what matter “[@NUM2]. So,if the winter hibiscus’ job, or hurdle that it has to jump,it to make it, to stay alive during the winter months, then its job will be done in the spring. The author ends the story with Saeng telling herself, “… in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again”[@NUM2]. If Saeng’s obstacle is completing, and passing the driver’s test, and she passes in the spring, right as the hibiscus passes it’s “test” , the symbolism between the two, showing a determined spirits to adopt, will grow deeper because that will adopt and pass their obstacle at the same time.
1	I think that the story came back to this because that is what the story starts off with. It all started with Saeng going to take a test but she did not pass it. So when the weather is better she would have a batter time trying to pass that test. This is way I think she came back that the test.
1	The reason why the author concludes the story this way is because she wanted to leave the reader in suspence : wanting more. You can tell because it never really says what the test is. She wanted you to try and guess what the test is. When Saeng walked up to her mother she had told her that she failed the test.
1	The author ends the story with that paragraph, to give an unsight on the next story. I think there will be another story because there are clue to support my theory. Just at the beginning of the paragraph at just when they come back. Then at the end at stay &quot;then I will take the test again. I dint stay happily ever after at anything similar its that at just stated those personally changes mentioned. So I think what the author will write another story so we could see if Saeng will pass her test.   
2	The author ended with this paragraph because it is an example of how everything gets a fresh start in the spring. an example of this is that the geese will return home after the winter to start a new family and also in the winter the hibiscus leaves will die and then in the spring they will have a new start, I think the author uses this paragraph last because it’s a metaphor of how everything will get a fresh start and also Saeng will get a new chance to take her driving test just like the plant and geese will get a new chance at life.
3	The author concludes the story with the paragraph because these geese coming back symbolize Saeng’s determination and hope that she needs to pass the driving test. She will wait for the winter to pass so that she can pass the test. The coming of spring also symbolizes renewal and birth. Saeng will have the chance again to pass the driving test with renewed faith and encouragement. This is a great way to end the story because it is really deep and makes the reader think about the meaning of the scene and how the geese, hibiscus plant, and spring arriving effect the conclusion of the story.
0	I think the author concludes the story with that ParagraPh to say that he will @CAPS1 uP in sPring time when the snow melts and geese return. Also I think that the author like the setting of sPring also to see the sunny skies a geese floating in a @CAPS2. I also would like that setting because It gives me more ideas and it's a very lovely setting to be around. That is why I think the author Picked that ParagraPh to conclude the story.
3	The short story, Winter Hibiscus, is a about a girl who moved with her mother to @LOCATION1. The story tells about the girls transition into the different culture. During the story, the author makes references to the daughter having to pass a test. At the end of the story the author wrote “In the spring…then I will take that test again.” In the text, the girl says “it’s-it’s not a real one,” when referring to the winter hibiscus plant she bought. The reader could infer that this quote means that the girl has memories of home, but they are not the real thing. Also the author wrote “… much preferred it to the Big Mac&quot;. This quote shows that she misses her own culture &amp; cannot adapt to the @CAPS1 one that she lives in now. In conclusion, the girls test @MONTH1 be that she needs to be able to handle change &amp; also be able to recall memories of her homeland with happiness instead of sadness.
0	The author concludes the story with that ending because he wanted to show the reader “if you just try, you might like it,” and that’s why the girl said she would come back next spring when the snows melt so she can take the test again.
10	To whom it @MONTH1 concern, I believe that computers benefit society. Computers are a wonderful household object to have that make life easier in many ways. Computers allow the everyday family to see new places, through photos online, and people, through the internet. Computers also provide a social networking throught a community, state, or even a country! Lastly, a computer is another resort to go to when trying to accomplish something, because there is always something on the internet that will help you. There's a famous quote that goes, &quot;the largest room in the world, is the room for improvement.&quot; In my opinion, the computers could make that room a little smaller. While experts say that computers are making people spend too much time indoors, and not too much time seeing the wonders of nature outside, the computer can prove them wrong. The internet is a wide ocean of pictures, wordes, and sounds. The computer is the item that organizes it, for your entertainment. There is a picture of just about anything imaginaeable on the internet; from the palm shaped islands of @LOCATION1, to the frozen @CAPS1 tundra in the @LOCATION3. You are able to see penguins in the southern ice cap and the ricefields of @LOCATION2 a bird's eye view all by simply moving your fingers. It's also possible not just to see places but to see people from how for the distance is! Today, people are sending pictures to and from each other via emails. People are actually sharing their memories with each other, all thanks for the computer. I hope what I have just explained now helps me make my. Computers are only here to make our lives. Imagine talking to your friends, not having an with his ever leaving your room. This would or even an impossibility fifty or seventy @DATE1, but this is People's social relationship have greatly progressed the half and it only goes has allowed people to their up on the their up on the their with their family and friends. I'll always a positive thing, using this right way. Having your house to tell, individually, your friend about your time to disney world is such a hastle. If you just put the pictures on a social networking system, like facebook, or twitter, memories will be stored through, litterally, the clicks of aborton. Memories are shared thanks to the social networking ability of the computer. Planing a vacation is a trough job to do, but what if that job could all take place in our sport? An entire vacation can be planned, confirmed and paid for thanks to the computer. Jobs that would normally take hours of researching and calling can be done in @DATE1 minuets for less using the computer. This allows people more time to go have fun with their lives and not have to worry about plannings. Computers allow people to compress hours of work into a matter of minutes. Experts say that computers are taking away people's lives&quot; I would disagree, because; people are new places or people, social networking is more advanced, and time that could have been spent planning is now living.
1	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it has everything together. One way it ties everything together is by taking what had happen in the beginning and tieing it in with why she had bought the flower in the first place. Also it ties Saeng's old memories from Vietnam to her new way of life in the United States. The story states &quot;carefully Saeng dicked it up and smilled. She closed her eyes and breathed in, deeply. the familiar programe filled her lungs.&quot; this is now the flower she found in the flower shop gave her memories from Vietnam. this is why the author concludes the story with that paragraph.
2	The author  concludes  the  story  with  that  paragraph because its telling / showing  us  that  Saeng  is  going   to  try to pass  the  test  in the spring  . Getting  that  hibiscus  reminded  her  of  her   homeland  and  it  gave  her  memories of  then . And  it also made her believe  in herself and want to get there and  try  again .

The author  test in “ when snow melts  and  the  geese  return  and this hibiscus is budding “ to help indicate  that  its going  to  be  spring  when  she  trys  to take  her test  again.
1	The author concludes the story with this pharagraph because he figures after all that has happened like she failed the test he wanted to end to be remembered is a happy thing. Also wanted the end to show how something bad happened but  next she was going to do it again. The author wanted to show that she wouldn’t give up, she goes after what she wants. And he wanted that to be the last pharagraph.
1	The author concludes the story the way that they did to signify that the girl will not give up trying to pass her test and will adapt to her new found home and make it what her home in Vietnam was to her. The girl is remeniscent of her past life and wishes to go back and have the life she had in her home country. When she is  
3	The Author chose to conclude the story with this paragraph because it is resolutive to the entire reading before it. In the story Saeng (the girl) had been stressed from failing the @CAPS1 test. She was also saddened by the memory of the hibiscus plant back in her native country Vietnam. At the end of the story when it says “when the snow melts and the geese return, and this hibiscus is budding, I will take that test again&quot; ,(Ho) the snow melting, geese returning, and the hibiscus budding symbolize change and adoption. Saeng will need to change and adapt to a new life to pass the test and feel better. This is why the Author @CAPS2 Ho, of the story “Winter Hibiscus” used a strong, symbolistic and resolutive end to her story.
3	After Saeng fails her driver’s test, she gives up hope for the future. The sight of the hibiscus plant reminds her to never give up, no matter how tough the situation. In the story, Saeng’s mother says, “Its flowers aren’t as pretty, but its strong enough to make it through the cold months here, this winter hibiscus. That’s what matters.” This quote shows how even though its not an object of beauty, it can do what it takes to survive. Saeng feels that she is also like the hibiscus, having the strength to be able to survive in a new environment. Even though she is new to this country, Saeng had proved that no matter how big the situation, anything can be overcomed if you believe in yourself and your family.
1	The author probably used this as the last paragraph to show that at this time next year she is going to take the again. The author writes this paragraph to show that she failed the test when the geese were going away for winter and the hibiscus was blooming.
2	The author concludes the end; of the story the way he/she did because it shows how much the plant truly means. S'aeng is going to wait till the flower blooms because it means so much to her. The flower represents her and her driving test. When the hibiscus is ready to bloom, she will be ready to drive. The plant gives her hope for a new tommorow, a new chance. The last paragraph helps the reader realize how much the plant means to the girl, its significance. It makes her feel more at home, and her home makes her feel stranger; makes her joyful and happy after the misery of failing the driving test.
0	She concludes with this the story this paragraph because she wants @DATE1 to come again. She says “when the snow melts”. She wants to look at the events again. and take care of them.
3	In this short story, Saeng vows to take the test again in the spring because she knows that she will be able to pass it once she has accepted living in this new place. After Saeng moved, she was very upset and missed her old home, family, and lifestyle. This prevented her from focusing on the test. However, once she realized that the flowers are beatiful in her new home too, she began to accept the changes. The geese being familiar to her symbolizes that she is adjusting to her new lifestyle. Saeng also probably made this vow because she didn’t want her mother to be disappointed in her again. After seeing her mother's disappointment and loving kindness, Saeng was determined to pass the test. When Saeng takes the test again in the spring, she will be ready because she has adjusted to and accepted her new life.
8	Dear local Newspaper, This is a letter about how I feel about the effects of computers. I think computers are great you can, interact with family and friends, learn about things going on around the world, and it could help you with school work. First I would like to say that you can interact with family and friends. You can just go on facebook, @CAPS1, or,myspace and talk, send pics, and comment on other peoples things. There are many groups you can join too, wich allows you to talk to other people and meet new friends. You can also interact with your family if they have a facebook or @CAPS1. The second reason why computers are not bad is because that there are many websites that you can find different information like science, math, history and all that kind of stuff. There are alot of different topics you can learn. You can find information from the weather to where your family history comes from. My last reasoning for thinking this way is that many kids do their homework on computers and if people are saying that computers are bad than the parents are not going to allow them to use the computer for educational purposes like homework and projects. There are many other reason why computers have a positive effects of people. But interacting with family and friends, learning about things around the world and your education depends on computers.
1	The authoR concludes thEy stoRy with thE paRagraph bEcause in thE bEing oF the stoRy heR Family movEd to thE United States from Vietnam. Saeng was walking home FRom Failing heR dRivER's test. She See a FamiliaR plant. Later she goes to a FloRist shop to see iF thE plant can be puRchased. So she gEt thE plant seeds and plant thEm so when they staRt to bloom she will go to heR dRiving test she Failed. I @CAPS1 she use the FoR good luck That is why I @CAPS1 the authoR conclude that paragRaph in thE stoRy.
1	The author concluded the story with the paragraph because it shows that Saeng can overcome obsticles, &amp; the next time she has these reminders she will succeed. When she says “almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things that she had thought of strange before had become... almost farmllular to her now” &amp; this is saying she is getting used to the chages in her new life. So the end paragraph reflects these ideas.
2	In the story, “Winter Hibiscus,” the author concludes the story with the paragraph for a few reasons. One reason is that she is trying to overcome change and wants to make the situation better. She trys doing that by taking the test again. The author also concludes with the paragraph because she feels heartbroken that life is not going her way and that she needs to do something about it. Thats why the author concludes the story with this paragraph to show you if she is determined or not. If she will stick through it or not.
1	I think that the author concluded the story with that paragraph because she is going to see if she can adapt to the new country. This is a good way to leave off the story because you don’t know if she will or not; it leaves you on a cliff hanger. I also tink this is a good way to leave it off because he could write a sequal to it and make a series out of it.
0	The author concludes this with the story because the snow is pretty and geese are animals that make it pretty so they want you to think that our outdoors is the nices thing around.
2	 The author, Minfong Ho, concludes the story  ’’Winter Hibiscus’’ with that paragraph to show Saeng  starting over…’’ In the spring , When the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding… connects to her  life, is that she is starting fresh in away. Although she @MONTH1 miss her old life, her grandmother, the well, and the fine toothed comb, she is making on effort, and ’’take that test again…’’ By retailing the test she shows that she is not ready to give in to ’’@CAPS1 of loss.’’ and to her grief.      
1	The author concluds the story with this paragraph because he knows all of this stuff going on will probley def come back up again. Just like how he said the geese, will geese  come back every year, so he is def saying that off of this will com back up. That is what I think.
2	I think that the author made that the concluding sentence because it means that when Saeng is ready then she will take the test again. I think that she is comparing herself to the snow, the snow the geese, and the hibiscus. I think so because she says that when the snow melts and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding then she will take the test again. So I think that she is saying that she is not ready for the test and when she does get ready then that is when she will take it.
2	The author's conclusion to the story shows how Saeng interpreted the experience of that day. She uses a spring time setting to show when her confidence in herself is reborn. Seeing her hibiscus bud in the spring will giver herself and newfound integrity to go try that driving test again.
2	Hope, positivness, helpful all are reasons the author concludes the story with this paragraph. First, the last paragraph gives the readers a sense that Saeng has hope. I felt that she had hope because she is willing to take the test again. Since she is going to take the test again she wants to  help her mother. Second, the last paragraph gave me the feeling that Saeng has a positive attitude. She bought a flower to replace the dead ones, and she stated that she will re-take the test in the spring. Third, Saeng is helpful to her mother. Saeng finished digging the hole for the new flower for her mother, so her mom could go make dinner. Saeng also saw the feeling her mom felt when she found out Saeng did not pass the test. So she is re-taking the test. Saeng was feeling just about what any other new kid probably would have felt. She was scared, but through everything Saeng had hope, a positive attitude, and she was helpful.
9	Dear @ORGANIZATION1, The age of the computer is upon us. Every where you go, you will see people with laptops or other portable computer devices. While some people dislike the world's large usage of the computer, I happen to disagree, I feel that the computer is a great @CAPS5 to put out and find information. I also feel that it is good @CAPS5 for people to communicate with ther family and friends who live far away. Lastly, I think that computers provide us with fun activities, entertainment, and a @CAPS5 to relax. What do you do when you want to know what the capital of @LOCATION3 is? You either go break out the old atlas, or, with a simple click of a button on the computer, discover that the capital is @LOCATION4. My point is that with computers, finding information is fast and easy. Also, with computers you can share information as well as receive it. Lets say that you are not a doctor but have discovered a cure for the common cold by using iteams find in everyone's households. What do you do? Well, you could go to the media and do interview after confrence after interview, or, you could simply post it on the @CAPS1. It is plain to see that the computer in an important not in the process of exchanging information. &quot;I'm sorry @PERSON2, but we can't fly out to @LOCATION1 to see @CAPS2 @PERSON1. We don't have enough money.&quot; I think that everyone has heard a variation of that line at least once. But here comes the computer to the rescue! With computers @CAPS2 @PERSON1 over in @LOCATION2 level is just a click (and or screen) away. By using webcams, you can speak with someone across the world without having to worry about the expensive costs of flights! No webcam? No problem! You can send someone very far away a message through e-mail or instant messaging. Say &quot;bye&quot; to expensive phre rides, long phone bills, or years going by seeing a loved one. Computers are,not just tools that are used strictly for, computers can be used for purposes as weel. In other words, computers can be used for fun! How exactly does the make computers have a creative on society? I'll tell you how. Many @CAPS4 are workaholics, also known as people who warr @CAPS5 to much. After a long day of signing papers and fiddling with a budget, wouldn't it be nice to just sit down and play some solitare? Thats possible with a computer, and you don't even need a deck of cards! Computers are full of fun games, like solitare and chess. These games are a great @CAPS5 to help people relax, and trust me, everyone needs relaxation. Having some downtime can really help someone to be a healthier and happier person! Aren't computers great? They can let us to exchange information talk to family and friendss across the globe(without a big pore tag), and they provide us with entertainment. So everyone out there could does not like the effect of the computers have on the public, please reconsider. Computers really are a helpful, fun, and useful tool to society.
1	To her the hibiscus was a test. Saeng felt she failed the test of letting go of the past and embracing “now.” The hibiscus reminded her of home, so she spent over @MONEY1 on it, knowing she and her mother needed the money. Essentaily, she felt as though she failed a test.
1	I think the author concludes the story with that parography because they want you to understand Saeng's strength. One reason I think they also end the story like that because she know inside that when her plant is strong and not covered in snow that she will be strong so that's when she wont`s to take her driving test. For example when she said, ”When the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again. That is why the author concludes the story with that paragraph. 
2	In the story “Winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho the main character Saeng and her mother, moved from their homeland to this new place, where everything was different. she was having a very hard time adapting to this new place, and Saeng failed an importian test. She had been very discouraged by this, and she was trying to remind herself of being at home. She bought the winter Hibiscus to remind her of home, but when she was planting it she became very determined to try and adapt, by taking the test, when the hibiscus would bud. The author is concluding by there being hope, and determination for Saeng to adapt to her new home.
3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it adds the uplifting message that Saeng will be able to overcome the obstacles of living in an unfamiliar country. First; the @CAPS1 geese represent a piece of her new home because she reasons “reluctantly” that they are familiar to her now, This depicts her ability to adapt to her new environment. In addition, she also equates spring to when the habiscus is budding and the habiscus is a symbol of herself because both are trying to live in a country that is not their own. Therefore, the habiscus budding represents her being able to live comfortably in @LOCATION1. Finally, she vows that she will take her drivers test again. Her intial failure to pass the test showed her inability to become a part of @LOCATION1, but if she passes it. Then she will have successfully adapted. Overall, the author of this stoy concludes with this paragraph because it contains the theme of the passage through an uplifting message.  
3	In the story “Winter Hibiscus” by Minfong ho, the ending includes the hibiscus budding and retaking the test to make a connection between the two. The geese are also included in the end to show the new country she has adapted to because she recognizes when the geese come and go. The budding of the hibiscus is to her much more than just a flower. It shows the rejuvenation of new life within her just as flowers tend to bud in the spring. That is also why she chooses to take the test because her “budding” will occur in the spring, and she will have newly born confidence for the upcoming test. That is why the geese, hibiscus, and the test are all included in the end of the story to show the connection between her past home and adaptation to a new lifestyle.
0	She will try gardning again after the geese and flowers return. She wants to have the best garden around. She wants to keep the tradition going.
0	I think the author concludes the story with this paragraph cause. Saeng didn’t think the winter hibiscus was In the ground now and that when she got back all of her plants was gone do to the snow so she said she will take that test again meaning she will start back to the first steps of her plants and flowers.
2	The author concludes, &quot;When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again because Saeng doesn't want to give up yet. In the story Saeng mumbled, &quot;I mean, not like the kind at-at- &quot;She found that she was still too shaky to say the words at home. &quot;Saeng was still upset because she misses her home in Vietnam. When Saeng puts the hibiscus in the ground she feels more alive and Saeng wants to feel at home in the United States. Saeng isn't going to give up driving but to try, harder and harder to pass the test.
0	The author concludes the story with This paragraph because it’s related to she thinks, when her semile of welcome warmed Saeng “cheep skip over live to you’re back she saw cheerfully” @CAPS1 it’s past time what took you so long? now did it go? Did you? She feels very skip over its related to
3	“When they came back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” The story “winter hibiscus” ended with this paragraph because it will be a fresh start for Saeng. It will be spring out and the geese will come back to her home where she lives now, which now has the hibiscus to remind her of her old home. The paragraph also compares Saeng to the hibiscus. In the story her mother says, “I’ve seen this kind blooming along the lake. Its flowers aren’t as pretty, but it is strong enough to make it through the cold months here, this winter hibiscus. That’s what matters.” Saeng is the winter hibiscus that’s strang enough to make it through winter and failing the test won’t matter until spring when she will take it and pass. That’s represented when the hibiscus is in bloom. I also think the story ended this way because it ties in Saeng’s feelings throughout the story of her new home and old home. It’s also showing her ability to conquer obstacles. She is going to forget about failing the driving test and work to pass it in the spring.
8	Dear Local Newspaper, I think computers have affect on people because firstly, it gives people the ability to learn from faraway places. Secondly, it allows people to talk online with friends. Thirdly, gives online games to little kids. Lastly you can wacth video's that can teach you all sorts of exotic things. My first reason I think computers have affect on people is it gives people the ability to learn from faraway places. For example if I want to go to @LOCATION4 for the @DATE1 and I know nothing about the place I can go online and look up I can look up their foods, their culture, their villages, and even there landscapes. Also the computer is good for book reports if your teacher told you to do a book report on @LOCATION5 instead of going in your text books, goion line you can look up their culture, there food, there location, how is there economy like, what kinds of school the kids go to what kinds of festivals they have etc. My second reason computers have affect on people is because it allows people to talk online with other people whenever they want. For example there are @NUM1 things that let you talk on the computer and that is @CAPS1, and @CAPS2 these two allows you to talk to friends that live faraway from you, my friend lives in @LOCATION1 and I live in @LOCATION2 we don't have cellphones so we go online to eiether @CAPS1, or @CAPS2 &quot;isn't that great&quot;!!. The computer also allows you to talk from faraway places like if you live in @LOCATION3 you can talk to somebody else in @LOCATION6. My third reason I think computers have affect on people is it gives online games to little kids. For example when I say games I mean educational games like reading games, math games, writing games, etc. Statistic say the @PERCENT2 to @PERCENT1 of kids learn more things on the computer than they learn in school that a huge percentage even for kids. Also when kids play computer games it more fun to them then sitting in class all day like my litt 
1	I think the author concludes the story with that Paragraph because the hibiscus makes them over come obstacles. She wanted to take the test again so she can @CAPS1 to her mum that she can past it. I also, think that because the hibiscus gives them strenghth and she got more confident in herself to past the test.
3	The author chose to end the story this way for several reasons. Some of the reasons is that it creates a feeling of hope in the reader, tells us we always have another chance and the importance of persistence. The ending paragraph creates a feeling of hope since it shows how everything will return and others will be another chance. The author chose to put this in the text since it creates a happy note to end on and give the reader happiness of knowing there is hope. Another reason the author chose to end the story with this paragraph is that it tells the reader that you always get another chance no matter what you do. The author wanted to impart this on the reader since it is an important lesson to know. The ending also tells the reader that persistance is very important in life and almost essential to live. The author shows this by talking about the snow melting, the geese returning and the flower blooming which are things that happen constantly and almost stop because they refuse to give up and die. Therefore, the author chose to end the story with this paragraph for several reasons. The author chose to end it this way since the paragraph gives a lot of hope to the reader and gives the idea of a second chance. The author also chose to end with this paragraph since it has several analogies to persistance which is vital in life.   
1	The authoR concludes the stoRy with this paRagRaph because he is saying that Saeng likes to do thing in the spring when she sees flowers gRowing because she feels like she is at home, so she feel moRe confident. about passing the test.
2	In the story &quot;Winter Hibiscus&quot;, the author concluded the story with the quote &quot;when they come back, Saeng's vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again.&quot; the auther put this paragraph as the concluding thought to stress that Saeng is determined to make a change. She failed the test but wants to take it again. Her grandmother's resemblance is in the flower so if the flower budds, then her grandmother will be back in a sense. When he grandmother &quot;comes back&quot; then @PERSON1 will feel as if her grandmother is giving her strength and encouragement to try the test again.
1	The auther ends with that paragraph to show how Saeng, like the budding  Hibiscus, will get a new start in the spring and overcome obstacles.
1	The auther concludes the story with, “when they cam back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and tis hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again. I think the auther used that conclusion to make the reader want to finish the story on their own. Or he could write another story to finish it. Most authors conclude their storys like this so the reader is in control about the ending.
2	Based on my understanding of the story I think the author concludes the story with the paragraph to emphize what will happened as well as to gate back to get to readler to thinking and build te excitement and with question as well as though in the head after reading the pessage. to my self to capture the reader attention as to the following upto and wondering of she survive and was able to adapt to the lifestyle that she was not use to and also see test her ability to see if she will be able to survive the different types of season and to know that no matter what you face in life their is alway more obstacles a head of you.
2	The author choose to end the story with that paragraph for emotional meanings. The last paragraph is saying she will re-take the test when the hibiscus is blooming in the spring. She hopes that the blooming hibiscus will give her strength to pass the test. The hibiscus reminds her of her homeland and gives her comfort. Saeng hopes the sight of the blooming hibiscus will remind her of her home and give her strength to pass the test.
2	The author ends the story in this way because the plant and leaving of the geese represent change to Saeng. The hibiscus isn't the same as she remembers from back home. The budding of the hibiscus shows Saeng's happiness from home. This paragraph shows that the familiarity of the budding plant gives Saeng courage and the ability to overcome her obstacle. The geese in this paragraph represent the keeping of time. The plant will budd at the time the geese return in the spring. If the author hadn't included this final paragraph, the full effect of memories for Saeng wouldn't have been fully portrayed. This line implies that Saeng was unable to overcome her obstacle because of the newness of this place. when the budds bring her a sense of home, she will be able to defeat the obstacle of her driving test. She will be more confident.
1	The author includes that because it show that she is not given up. Since she is not given up she can have more trys.
8	Dear newspaper, @CAPS1't you love to go in your computer? @CAPS1't you get a lot done on them? Well I think they have a positive effect on people. I strongly agree that computers have a positive effect on our society. These are my three reasons; you can chat online with friends and family, help people do research on projects, and help people get there jobs done in everyday life. So please, local newspaper keep reading and I will change your mind about computers effects on people. Do you have family or friends who @CAPS1't live around here that you want to keep in touch with? Using the computer for email or a chat site like facebook will do that. I have cousins who live in @LOCATION2. The only way my family can keep in touch with them not spending money is email. My mom and her sister are sending emails to each other all the time. If you ask me I think that is a positive effect computers have. Have you ever researched anything using a computer? I knew I have! For a school project in @CAPS2 I had to research about @LOCATION1. I did all my research on the computer. I got an A+! I would not have gotten that grade if I did not use the computer to do research. Do you use a computer in your job? Well even if you @CAPS1't I know a lot of people who do. For example, my dad uses a computer for almost the whole day he is at work. He is a @CAPS3 @CAPS4 which means he managed portfolios. He has to use @ORGANIZATION1 to check on the stock chart. Another example is my mom, teacher, she has using the computer to email parents if the student need help or up. So as you can see computers have good effect on our society. These are my reasons : you can chat online with friends and family, helps people do research on projects, and helps people do research on projects, and helps people get there jobs done in everyday life. I hope you agree that computers have a positive effect on our society. Say yes to computers good effect!
3	There are many reasons wht the author chose to conclude the story with Saeng vowing to attempt the driver's test again. At first, the story begins with a tone of sadness and seing fact &quot;as Saeng walks home after failing her driver's test&quot; this quote sets the tone as sadness because she has failled a very important test and she is walking alone. &quot;She sees a familier plant&quot; is when the hope comes back into the story. When she brings the plant she had purchased here to her mother also sees delinlted. &quot; where did you get it?&quot; her mother aasked, and Saeng replied &quot;I bought it.&quot; She bought it for @MONEY1 more then her mother said for all of the seeds in the garden. As time went on it was clear to her mother the plant signifies strength and hope to her daughter and endyat the plant with have as well I remember a time upon my mother bought me a work-candle cat desdion. I felt it was a waist of money, but when @CAPS1 saw her light delights for I it with love as well. When Saeng's mother felt have from thr plants made Saeng happy and gave her courage the driver's test again. is the reason why the author chose to conclude the story with Saeng vowing to attempt the driver's test again. 
0	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because it makes the story longer and it gives it a good ending but I have no idea on what that means so the author should explain what it means not me.
0	the Author concluded the story with this paragraph because @CAPS1 was try intoto let us know what happen after the story was done. and tryed to make it clear and that’s why I think that @CAPS1 came up with that idea to conclude with that paragraph.
0	The author concludes this paragraph because Saeng is going to wait untill winter is over so she can have a fresh beginning. She wants to try again because the last time she messed up and tilled the plants. Saeng wants to become a gardener like her mother.
0	The author of this essay includes those sentences as the conclusion to make it that she will realize that they are coming back.
2	The author concludes the story with the paragraph, “When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow…” to show that Saeng got stronger. She got, stronger because she adjusted to her new home and new environment. Saeng is more confident in herself to take the test again. She doesn’t want to cry again, like she did in her last test. Being more confident and more adjusted is the reason why she has become stronger, and the reason why she wants to take the test again is because she is stronger.
2	Confidence, persistance, memories – all things that Saeng has “that helps explain why the author concludes this story with this paragraph since Saeng moved from her own country, she has not been very happy, she was upset pretty much the whole time and misses everyone and @CAPS1 from Vietnam; @CAPS1 she sees reminds her of it, that last paragraph, where it says, “then I will take that test again,” shows that she has confidence in herself and wants to try harder next time. She shows persistence when she says she will try again and hopefully, she won’t give up, Saeng misses almost @CAPS1 from Vietnam, even the food. She also misses her family and how they look and dress. Her memories were probably hold her back from concentrating hard on her drivers test, she knows she wanted to do good so she bought the flower in hopes that would make her feel better. Hopefully, Saeng’s life will get better in the United states and she will learn to love this country.
1	Because withe the blooming of the hibiscuse plant comes new hope. In the story she sees the hibiscuse as her old life and with the budding of the plant starts a new chapter in the young girls life.
3	I think that the author concludes the story with this paragraph because he’s trying to prove his point. I think that Saeng was comparing herself to the flower. For example the flower was originally a wild flower and then and then it was planted in a pot. Saeng was free happy girl but then she had to move to @LOCATION1. Both the flower and Saeng feel like they are out of place. Since in the story Saeng is similar to the flower then at the end then at the end of the story I think that Saeng thinks that if the flower can survive the winter then she can survive @LOCATION1 and she can pass the test. This is why I think that the author finished with that paragraph to get his message across.
1	The reason why the author concludes the story like that is because he or she wants to show Saeng is determined to not fail that drivers test. The author wants to leave Saeng on a good note so she wont be sad. When she takes the test again shell be better prepared and know what shes expecting. Shell have a better winter.
9	Dear reader, @ORGANIZATION1 has had a dramatic effect on human life. It has changed the way we do almost everything today. The most well know, is the computer. This device has allowed people do buy things online, talk to people online, and also provides entertainment for some people. All good qualities that make everyones lives easier. Imagine you look into your refrigerator and you notice it's almost empty. Someone is using the car and you need to go grocery shopping and the store is too far. What do you do? Well you could go on a computer and look for food online. Ther are many great deals and some companies even deliver for free! The amazing and easy way to buy food without leaving your house. But food isn't all you can purchase. Many products are sold through the computer. Need new toys for kids? Or how about a new hat for your friend? Maybe even more curtains for your room? Well at the easy access of internet on a computer, you can buy all those items and more. The computer has also the way of communication. Let's say someone wants to talk to a friend or relative that lives far away in another country. @CAPS1 someone dosen't own a phone or @CAPS1 they can't make the call, all these is to be in you on the computer. You can communicate with anyone just by using your email adress. Now friends and families can talk to each other over the ease of the computer. Just type to want to say and &quot;boom,&quot; instant, on the chat. Let's face it. No matter what a child or even teenager . But now with a computer all that can change. With just one click you could actually be watching a movie from the comfort of your own home. But what @CAPS1 you don't want a movie? No entertainment like listing to musics, watching fun, and probable the most popular playing games. Everyone loves to play a game every once in a while, and with the selection of thousands of online games, these isn't or person who can't fled atleast our game enjoyable. There are even games for educational fun that many kids love. With all the entertainment a computer can produce; who could hate it? All in all the computer is a revolutinizing device that has changes the way we shop, communicate, and find exciting entertainment. To be able to do so much with just a couple clicks; new that I find extravagant. It blows my mind to see and think, &quot;@CAPS1 we can do this now, I wonder what we can accomplish in the future.
7	Dear @CAPS1 and @CAPS2 of the @LOCATION1 @CAPS3 I think that computers are a good thing to use. I know that some people do use the computer instead of enjoying a or exercising, but not everyone does that, The computer is a good resource to invest time in. The effects computers have on people is good (for the most part). The statement is true, people that use the computer can talk with people online and get information quickly than the library. I believe that the effects a computer has on a person, are good effects. When people use a computer they can get information which for research and work (word) That's because, when your on a computer you can simply relax but get available amount of work done. You can also do things while your on the computer, hold your dog, hold your cat, eat, drink, text, call. It's very multi propose (use). But some computers is a bad thing because not how the very expensive and same dont have the money to buy a computer but if you do have, you because they're of people or example @CAPS4 cheated and not a computer he could have good so rich and rumors because the computer is what he needs to be succesful with microsoft so computers are useful and the effect they have on people is a positive one.
10	Dear @ORGANIZATION1, I am aware that some people think computers have a negative affect on others, but I think it's the opposite. Computers have completely changed the world. People can save work on them, visually experience things they've never seen before, or even catch up with old buddies. In my opinion computers have a positive affect on people. With computers you can create documents, pictures, and even movies that will stay on your computer forever. How about your newspaper company? Does somebody hand write every paper that comes out? Without computers hundreds of copies of your newspaper wouldn't be able to b made every day. Not to mention, what would happen if you didn't use computers and a fire occured? All of your hard work will be turned into ash, but if it was on the computer you be able to retrieve it. You can save anything on a computer. Another reason why computers have a positive affect on people is because throught the internet you can visually experience places or things you couldn't before. If I was going to book a vacation I wouldn't just trust a book, I would wont to go on the computer so I could see pictures, videos, or hundreds of other articles I couldn't see anywhere else. This goes for anything else like furniture, instruments or even cloths. Computers offer alternative views that books don't. Not only can computers save data and give you visuals, but they give you an oportunity to catch up with old friends, relatives, or even meet new people! Instead of endlessly searching through phone books you can just type in their name and you bound to find somewhere on the internet. Popular websites like @CAPS1 make this extremely easy. When my dad was in search of his childhood friend he typed his name on @CAPS1 and ended up calling him @NUM1 minutes later! That wouldn't have been possible without computers. Computers truley do have a positive affect on people everywhere without them many things today wouldn't be possible. Hopefully others will agree with me too.
1	I think the author concludes the story as he or she did to teach a lesson. No matter what stands in your way or no matter what slows you down never give up. You should keep on trying. If you fail something, try again and again until you get it right.
2	@CAPS2, memories, hard @CAPS1 â€“ All are reasons why the author conluds the story with this â€œWhen They come back, saeng vowed silently to herself in the spring, when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is buddng, Then I will take the test again. First @CAPS2 because she failed her test first so it takes some guts and will power to go back and even try it again. Also because when she remember her grandmother it upsets her so that definatly takes @CAPS2 and the human will power to do her test a second time. Next memories. I @CAPS4 she keeps wanting to do this test because she has had so many good memories with her grandmother and doesnâ€™t want to ever forget them. But again goes back to the will power or the want to, to go back and do the test a second time. Last All the Hard @CAPS1. All the Hard @CAPS1 because She knows what her grandmother  ment to her and threw all the things or Hard @CAPS1 that her grandmother put out she saw and wants to honaor or apreciate all of the stuff that her grandmother did for her. These are the reasons that @CAPS3 @CAPS4 the author ended with that Paragraph rather than some other paragraph
2	The author include s the last paragraph to show that she still has hope. it is the last sentence because @CAPS1  fong Ho wants to show that when all seems lost and your at the end of the line you can always hope for the better when spring comes so will a new beginning not only saeng’s plant but also for her life in a different country.
2	The author of “Winter Hibiscus”chose to end the story with that paragraph to reenforce the theme of the story and conclude with a hopeful tone. The theme of the story is adjusting to new circumstances and making the best out of each change. &quot;Saeng vowed silently to herself&quot; tells the audience that Saeng is making an effort to fit in and find the good in her new life. The hopeful tone that is created is a way to show that Saeng is willing to accept changes in life and wants to do her best to overcome obstacles. She says, “I will take that test again”. The test represents the obstacles she will overcome when efforts applied. The hibiscus in the sentence &quot;…when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding...” @CAPS1 starting over. The budding hibiscus is compared to Saeng with a fresh start and determination to achieve her goals of adjusting to a new lifestyle. The author chose this paragraph to conclude the selection to highlight the theme and symbolize a new start
3	I think the author concludes the story with that statement because the audience can then compare saeng and the hibiscus. After reading that statement, I realized saeng and the hibiscus are alike because they are both going to make it through and come out on top, (Saeng getting her license and the hibiscus bidding) @CAPS1 the author might have ended the story with that statement because it shows that saeng is committed to working toward her goal and won’t give up. “Saeng  vowed silently to herself, “I will take that test again”, Finally I think  the author concluded the story with that statement because it gives the audience the satisfaction of knowing what is going to happen to saeng but leaving a little mystery for the audience to fill in how  they want. For example, I know saeng is going to take the test again and I believe she will pass it, @CAPS2, another person reading it might believe she failed again and had to retake it again.
3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to let the reader compare the girl to the geese and the hibiscus. The geese leave for the. winter and then come back in the spring, however the geese also show how the girl is going to come back and take the drivers test again in the spring. The hibiscus dies off over the winter and starts budding again in the spring, this shows that winter is its weakness. Like the hibiscus the girl overcomes her weakness of not being able to drive by remembering her homeland. The author puts this paragraph at the end of the story so you can see that the girl is like the geese and the hibiscus.
3	I think the author concluded the story with that phrase because it shows she will mature. She is saying that she was not ready for all the challenges she was going to face, For example she did not pass her test but instead of crying about it she just said I will take it again next year. In the story she also longed for her homeland, which she truley missed. She coped with this by buying a winter hibiscus to remind her not only of her homeland but also of her grandmother overall the main character showed depth and maturity throughout the piece.
2	The author concludes the story the way that she does because it shows Saeng’s willingness to adapt to her surroundings, just like the hibiscus. Saeng needs to adapt to her new home in @LOCATION1, and the hibiscus needs to adapt for the upcoming winter. Saeng vows to herself, ”When the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding…” @CAPS1 from this, you can tell that Saeng has hope for both herself and the hibiscus. Initially, Saeng was very reluctant to accept her home. She says of the hibiscus, “it’s not like the kind we had before.” But she realized that the hibiscus could be a reminder of home as well as reminder to change for her new home. She knew that if the hibiscus could survive the winter, she could survive living somewhere new.  
2	The author concludes this story with the promise Saeng made to herself to take the test again, come springtime, because Saeng is having trouble adapting to her new home, and she won’t give up on fitting in after only one failure. Remembering her home and that she will never be able to return are painful thoughts to Saeng and memories of it help her cope with her loss. The hibiscus and other familiar flowers she found comforted her, because they reminded her of home. At springtime when the geese return and the hibiscus starts blooming, Saeng will feel ready again to take the test, the spring represents the chance for another try, and a new beginning.
2	The author concludes the story with the last paragraph. The author chose because the sentence informs you Saeng will take the test agin. In paragraph @NUM1 Saeng tell’s her mother she faild the test. So by the time spring comes around the hibiscus will start budding and Saeng will retake the test. Also the geese left the home temporally because of snow. So she sort of compares herself to the geese because she missis her home. The geese will return when the time is right, that is what the author concludes in the story’s paragraph.
8	Dear local news paper, In @CAPS1 oppinion I think that those who makes compiuters should make up an times added to the compiuters. There should be a law that people has to go out and exercise before and after then use compiuters finally, I think that childrens should use the compiuter less than the adult fee health reasons. @CAPS1 first oppinion that I think that those who makes compiuters should make timers added to the compiuters to time tha amount of tim people should take depending on what they are doing like when some one is playing a game they spend hours playin instead of doing a diffrent activity. Also like when a person is doing their home work they start getting carried away in taking their time going slow and ends up finishing very bad. @CAPS1 second oppinion that I think that those who makes compiuters should have a law that people has to go out and exersise before and after they use compiuter because there is a big percentage amount of people who are obeast because everyone sits in the sits in the compiuters and starts to eat while they are playing games and watching videos for hours and they dont take a break to go outside and @CAPS1 third and final oppinion that I think that those who makes compiuters should have childrens use the compiuter less than the adults for health reason's because kids are always looking at the compiuters an their eyes are always getting red and then they start to not being able to see as well as they used to then they end up having to need glasses or abetter perpscription glasses. Also becaus kids are usually going into chatting sites and they start to talk to people who they dont know so they end up getting raped or kidnapped by the person that they went to talked to for hours. So local news paper will you make that change for the society and for the childrens? Because I would!
1	I believe that the author concluded the story with this paragraph because the plant represent to being determined to survive. In other words, the hibiscus brings Saeng a good luck for her next driving test after winter season uhen the hibiscus is budding. Also, the reason why the author concluded the sentence to show what her plan for the future
2	In the story ‘’ Winter Hibiscus,’’ the author concludes the story with this paragraph  for many reasons. This paragraph shows that Saeng  will not give up, she  will wait for next time  to come around to take the test. It also means she will be well prepared and will have a list  of  confidence in passing  this test. It gives the reader an idea that Saeng will not give up and she will complete the test. Her mother will be proud of her  for it and it shows Saeng will never give up. Just like when she said “let’s plant it, right now,’’ T his example shows that even though Saeng had failed the the test and disapointed her mother,she will never give up and she still has hope in the plant just like how her mother has hope for Saeng.         
1	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because he is talking about when Saeng vowed silently because she is thinking about what had happen a long time ago with her mom, the plants in her garden. Saeng was thinking about when everything comes back how will it be with the return of Spring, when the snow melts how will things be, the geese retorning and she will take the test again, that is what She was vowed silently to herself about. That is how i thik the author will conclude the story with this paragraph included wit it.
1	The author concludes the story with this paragraph. In this story it about a @PERSON1, a girl and her mother. The girl is given money to buy a plant seeds. She spend @MONEY1 on this plant. Her mother get upset, but every thing turn on it, lk they had egg omlets with bits of melon.
2	The author concludes this story with this paragraph because she wants to show that after everything that happened, saeng will move on and try hard. For example, when she said, “When they come back in the spring, When the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” By ending the story like this, it leaves the reader in suspense because they do not know if the geese will return. The author seems to be showing the reader that Saeng is starting to adapt to her new country and make it like her old one. For example, when the mother said, “I’ve seen this kind blooming along the lake. Its flowers aren’t as pretty, but it’s strong enough to make it through the cold months here, this winter hibiscus.” This shows that they want their new country to be more like their old one and when it is, she will be happy. Therefore, the author concludes this story with this paragraph to show how she will adapt to the change in her environment.   
1	The author concluded the story with this paragraph because she can not wait until spring because her plant will budd and it will remind her of her home land again. She can not wait to take the test in spring because she would have been alsole to stayed and she @MONTH1 pass the test in the spring because she did not pass it the first time she toke the test. Maybe she concluded the story with this paragraph because she @MONTH1 like the spring and she can not wait for it to come.    
3	I believe there is a meaningful reason why the author concludes the story with this paragraph. I think that the author will feel more confortable and ready to take the test. I was able to come to this conclusion because by waiting for winter to be over to take the test again, she is giving herself time to prepare. Also, she is waiting for the hibiscus plant to bud. Something. I was able to extract from the fact that she wants to wait for the hibiscus is the presence of confort, the whole story revolves around how saeng was able to confort herself by reminiscing on her past experiences in Vietnam. When she feels that an important part of her life is returning, that she can become comfortable and focused. I think the author would conclude the story with this paragraph is because the author wants to stress the importance of this flower involving how saeng lives her life
2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show she has hope. She believes that she can pass the test when everything is back to normal, in the spring. In the spring the geese will return and the hibiscus will be budding. This makes her feel more at home because it was always like this before she moved. Also she likes the geese and the hibiscus and these things might make her feel more comfortable. This is why the author concludes the story with the paragraph to show she has hope.
2	The author concluded the story with this paragraph he/she wanted to compare Saeng life with the plant. For example, in the story Saeng had just failed her driving test and then she saw a plant the reminded her of homeland. From the flower shop to the house, she is comparing her home land to the flower which shows how she relates to it. So the concluding paragraph shows how when the hibiscus is budding and starts a new phase she will too and go for her drivers license.
3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show saeng’s determination to adapt to the change in her life. In the story saeng fails her drivers test and is struggling to adapt to her new life in @LOCATION1. However, when she sees that the hibiscus and geese are familiar, she is determined to adopt as well. Saeng buys a hibiscus because it reminds her of home. This not only comforts her it also makes her miss her old home more. The hibiscus can survive in both @LOCATION2 and @LOCATION1, so it helps saeng realize that she can as well. The author includes the geese because they help saeng realize that she is becaming more familiar with things in the United states, so she can continue to adapt. Saeng says that she now recognizes the “V” shape of the geese. Realizing that she is becoming more accostomed to @LOCATION1 and she is able to survive helps her reach the determination to retake and pass her driving test. The author includes it to summarize the story theme of adopting to change.
10	I think that computers help people in there everyday lives. They just make things so much easier. Computers help us to find information @CAPS2 we needed. Book hotels and airliners, they even allow us to interact with our friends. Yes it might take away times to do other things like exercising, but we can find out away to do both. Everyday I would go on the computer a little bit and then go outside for an hour to play basket ball. People just need to find a way to it out. Computers are good for if you need to find information about anything. All you need to do is type in what you want, and within seconds you have hundreds of different links for your desire. For example if you are in @CAPS1 school and you are deciding what college that you should go try the a great place that you can go to get information. People all over the world do that just about everyday. It is also a great place if you need information if you are doing a project in school and you need more info on your subject @CAPS2 I say it make things a lot easier there is no better example a reservation for a hotel or buying a plane ticket. Both of those things do on a computer because otherwise odds are you with of then. If we didn't have computers you would need to go to the hotel and get a room, and if there were no room you out of luck. On a computer it will say if they have any or not you would need to @CAPS3 tickets would have the exact same thing. Computer say @CAPS2 there are available flights to your destination and how much. So @CAPS2 you go to the airport you are not surprised. Another good reason why computer are good for people is that it helps your interact with your friends and family @CAPS2 you can't see them. There so many different ways you can do it to. On @CAPS4, @CAPS5, myspace. All the websites like that help you stay in touch with all of your friends. Even now they have somethings where you can actually see the person you are talking to over the computer. So if you have no chance of seeing each other anytime soon you can talk to them then. I even do that with my brother, he is in college and I dont see him that much so I just start chatting with him on the computer. Now those are some reasons on why I feel that computers are a great part of our lives. Thing like finding information and booking hotels, airplanes, ect. All help make our lives a lot easier at times. And talking with other people just makes us happy. Now I hope you see why computers are a good part of all of our lives.
0	I think that the author put that sentence to get a little personal with the character so you can relate to that person.
2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show the importance of new beginnings and to accentuate the theme in the story. The theme is that one must overcome hardships and seek new beginnings. The springtime is a representation of a new beginning. So, the new beginning of spring will allow her to start all over again on the drivers’ test. Also, the author uses the paragraph to show the symbolic qualities of everyday things. Just how the hibiscus reminded her of home life, the geese will remind her of springtime.
2	In the story &quot;Winter Hibiscus&quot; the author Minfong Ho concludes the story with that paragraph because it was a way of saying shes going to forget about what happen in the past with her failing her test and shes going to do better the next time. Its like the author is saying she will be reborn again like the hibiscus, when the spring comes. Through the story Saeng had to adjust just like the hibiscus. And the hibiscus inspired Saeng to do well where shes at. So it’s a new beginning to Saeng, after all her learning from hibiscus.
1	It’s kind of like a theme for the story. The hibiscuss inspire her to want to do things. I guess it brings memories of her home country and makes her want to try new things. This is significant to the story because it shows you how important the hibiscus was to saeng.
1	I think the authour chose to end the story this way to show that the girl is remembering her past and being at, ease. with the flower she at a since of peace. The writer wants to convey that no matter what your used to you can find something that can bring you happiness and a since of focus.
1	The author concludes the story with this paragraph @CAPS1 she is detarmand to pass that test and is not going to give up until she passes it.
2	The reason why I feel the authour ended the story with this paragraph is because she is showing how the charater has matured and how the charater grew in her circumstance. This shows that because you failed once doesn’t mean your going to fail again. Also it’s okay to feel out of place there is alway going to be a time in life where a new beginning is going to start so it is your choice to take that chance or be stuck in your own ways but the decision is always up to you.
3	In the short story “Winter Hibiscus” by “Minfong Ho” she ends the story by saying, “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again. “I-I failed the test”. As many kids do, Saeng failed her driving test and she is crucially upset about it. nobody wants to fail at something and it is almost a humiliating experience to have failed at a test. knowing that others have already successfully passed. With the quote in the introduction paragraph, or the one in the question, it was written as a sign of symbolism. When the geese return back north, it is to show that they are ready to “start over” again or to “try again”. When the hibiscus is budding it is trying to “start life” again. Saeng seeing objects doing things over and over again empowers her to want to succeed and try again. She realizes it is just a part of life and that in order to succeed you have to fail. Minfong concludes with that quote because she understands that no matter what the obstacle, you must press forward and keep trying in order to succeed. She realizes success can only come from hard work and commitment, and that that is what makes a great, strong individual.
1	The reason why the author concludes the paragraph with that sentence is because her wants to let reader know that it's not over. He wants the reader to know @ORGANIZATION1 will not forget. And also that all this will happen again.
2	The author concludes the ending as “I will take that test again” meaning that the things she going through now is going to happen again but next time she will be peperd. Saeng has a very difficult time moving to another country and getting comfortable in the place the mother suports her as she go throught winter the hibiscus that she bought is a symbol that represent more than it selfs, in this text of winter Hibiscus by Minfong Ho shows this biscus that she bougth when she was in wrost time, she went throug winter with the hibiscus nand at the last paragraph of the story express “when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding” she is thinking of the feature and how she “saeng vowed silently to herself in the spring. She can’t wait until winter is over and is just waiting for the spring to come.
8	Dear Local Newspaper, I believe that people should stay with computers. I have three reasons for this issue and they are @CAPS1, @CAPS2 and @CAPS3. I think these reasons woul'd be a good for this issue because every human being can do these three this on a computer. One of the reasons why I think people should stay to computers is because they can learn. People can learn by using computers because if a child is in something like animals. They can go on the internet and look up what they need to find children can also learn on the computer by putting their jump stat first grade give in the drive. children can learn like this. My second reason why people should use stay to computers us @CAPS2. I think @CAPS2 because you can talk to your friends about. They can also talk about if they want to go some fun. For example same good exercise. Another reason why I think @CAPS2 is if your friend is explaining something to you, that your. I also think @CAPS2 can be had for other to a and. The last reason why I believe people should stick to computer is because people can discover different things on there these things can be had and some can be good. For example a good thing that I can discover is that if there is something wrong with my computer and I figure out how to fix this that would be good. And I will know about computers and man what to do. A bad thing about @CAPS3 the computer I can do is bringing up a virus. That know matter what I do I can't make it go away and the computer ends up being broken. Conclusion, Local newspaper this is why I believe that we should keep our computers. Because many people even young children can learn and they will end up remembering the things that they learn.
0	The reason why the author concludes the story with this paragraph is to tell us what she does once she gets back in the spring. That means when she gets back, she will then be taking care of the plants. When she gets  gets  back she wants the snow to melt and everything. That is what the author is telling me from the story.
1	I think the author concludes the story with the paragraph to ensure the reader that she will say again. Also, the author concludes the story this way to show the reader that no matter where you go in life it will always be something and or someone their to assure you of everything. The author also wanted the reader to feel a sence of similarity to the character meaning no matter how out of place you feel its always something you can relate to
1	The author concludes the story with thise paragraph so that we buy his comming book, or so that we get more exited.
1	In this story theauther deicides to end the story with this paragraphe, &quot;when they come back, saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is buding, then I willtake that test agien.&quot; because she wants to take the test when every thing is isanters, de forexample she wants everything she likes in her nuforment such as the flowers, the geese and the whether. Another reason why I say the author ends the story with that paragragh because she wants to be, ua eviorment like the one that she was in her home country forexemple there was no snow it was like sping time all ver around. This is why I say that the auther ended the story with that paragraph.
2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show that she is comforted by the memories of her homeland and really appreciates the beauty of tropical plants. She believes that since it is winter and the hibiscus is not budding, that cannot pass the test until it is. “almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the thing that she had thought of before had become through the quite repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now. “This shows how much she really does believe in the beauty of her homeland and the tropical plants because she is thinking back to other times where things have been strange during the winter and better in the spring and @DATE2 seasons when the plants are budding, so she believes that she will actually pass the drivers test when she feel comfortable, when the plants have budded.
3	The geese flying south for the winter and the hibiscus budding are normal things to Saeng. The author wanted to conclude the story with this to show that Saeng felt comfort in things that she was acustomed to. Saeng wanted to have the geese and hibiscus there to feel more comfortable while taking her driving test. Saeng still longs for home and does not quite feel like she fits in the u.s. The hibiscus gives her that comfort feeling like she is home again, in Vietnam, Saeng still feels homesick because she wants things to be how they were. The plants in the green house along with the disappointment of failing her driving test bring her to the emotional state that she was in. In the second to last paragraph the author talks about the feeling of repetition Saeng has when seeing the v formation. Saeng feels that in the winter she will not have the same comfort feeling as when she can see the hibiscus and the geese flying overhead. It says when Saeng arrived in the @LOCATION2 she had nothing that was familiar to her.  Now she gets that feeling from the geese and plants. The author concluding by saying Saeng will take her driving test when the winter ends is a good closing because it gives you some insight as to what Saeng is going to do.
0	I think the author concludes the sentence then they come back, Saeng vowed to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geess and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again&quot; is that because it was winter and the school was closed. When the geese come back it will be spring, so it will be time to go back to school. I think thats the reason.
3	In the story, “Winter Hibiscus,” the author concludes his story with an odd ending. “’when they come back,’ Saeng vowed silently to herself,’in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus budding. then I will take that test again.’” I believe that beyond the literal meaning the author is showing how Saeng is adapting to the new country. By failing her driver’s test she also failed in adapting and accepting the new country By vowing to try again it also shows that she is willing to give the country another chance. “She found she was still too shaky to say the words at home..” I believe that this is showing that she still didn’t consider this country her home. She was still stuck on her past.       
1	The author concludes this story in the paragraph to show that saeng wont stop, just because she faild one first time. It also shows that she is not going to let certaint things keep her down.
2	The last sentence of a story is usually the most meaningfull. I believe the author ended the story this way for many reasons. For example, I think the author did this to leave the reader with a strong sense of determination. The story quotes, “I will take that test again.” By use of the word will, the author shows the girls determination. She didn’t say she would try to, she said she will, without a doubt. I also think the author ended this way to emphasize the theme of new begginigs. The story quotes, “when they come back... in the spring... I will take that test again. This shows that in spring, the new begginig of life she will take the test. This is why I believe the author ended the story this way.
8	Dear town of southing ton, Computers our town are very important for instance. For all of the banks we have computers and for almost every job. We need computers for life, and that doesn'@CAPS1 make use lazy and forget full it makes us busy. The only situation with someone who is online being lazy is with a teenager playing games. But the only reason some kids do that is because they all dont want to go and exercise or run around with their family who they see everyday. But because they want to talk to their friends make plans and just talk while they play togeather. If someone is ignoring their family or becomeing more lazy, it is because that is their choice to sit around and do nothing. And I do agree that people are becomeing over weight but I think that is because some people consider a workout to be an hour of lifting and running once a week. And that isn'@CAPS1 right. I think that this news paper should post up adds about gyms and maybe that will lower the faty meter in our town. or if they think people are neglecting their families have people work less so they can go home and see their families. As for teens I think you parents out there need to set some rules like @NUM1 hours of play a day, @NUM2 hours on a @DATE1, and if they don'@CAPS1 listen take the game away for a day of two, but that might not get them to spend time with you because they @MONTH1 be mad, but it will get them outside or atleast doing somehting more active and not watching @CAPS1.V. or playing video games all day. Also I know this from expieriance becouse I am a teanager and I always go outside and run around when my parents take my games away, and it's @PERSON1 that of homeworld. Please take my advise and your happy caring family will always stay togeather and active and not always sitting on the computer stressing over work and playing videos games.
3	The author of “Winter Hibiscus” made a good choice to conclude the story with “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus  is budding, then I will take that test again.” This paragraph hints to the reader that Saeng intends to combine her new and old lives. Her old life is represented by the hibiscus; she used to the constants from back home. The geese symbolize her new life; they have become “almost familiar to her now” The obstacle she faces is passing the driving test. The author implies that in the spring, when the old and new parts of Saeng’s life are combined, Saeng will be able to overcome her “obstacle,” and all will be well. With the geese in the ground, Saeng’s life will have come full circle.
0	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because its important when she says when geese returns and this hibisus is budding then she says she will take that test again and to tell the reader when she will take that test again. Thats way its in the story.
2	In the story “Winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho. I think the author concludes the story with this paragraph because it emphasiseS that Saeng is willing to retake the test when it comes back. I also think that the author concludes the story with this paragraph because in the story the @NUM1 to last paragraph says, “Almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quite repititon of the season upon season, almost farmiliar to her now.” This sentence shows me that @PERSON1 is slowly getting used to the new place. Also how she is changing her mind about the pLant and the fact that even though its not the same, it can still have meaning. Therefore, I think the author made a good choice in ending the story with this paragraph.   
2	The last paragraph states “in the spring, when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding then I will take that test again.” I believe the author has ended with that paragraph to state the fact when her new home is like her old home maybe she will feel more confident and more in her place, instead of cold winter total opposite of where she use to live. The feeling of her old home, in her new home will make her more positive and comfortable. So then she will take the test feeling at home and pass.
1	In the story “Winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho. The author expresses how the girl believes with her memories and once she changes and adapts to the culture that’s when she will have the courage to re take the test she failed that day. Saeng misses her home so much and she can’t grasp that their are similarities between her new home to her old home. “She realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familar to her now”. Saeng didn’t want to expect the move but noticeing that she won’t forget any memories she starts to take on new memories. At first everything was so different now she is starting to remember things about her new home which is a sign of comfort to her. “She found that she was still too shaky to say the words at home, lest she burst into tears again.&quot; With Saeng’s feelings of the change the ending paragraph lets the reader know that there is hope for moving on her knew home. She is gradually starting to gain confidence and she knows when she does she can take her test an succeed at it. The author shows how good change can be if your willing to adapt. Everything might not always be as perfect as you know it to be but your courage will make a happy home with new and old memories, As Saeng starts to relize during the last paragraph.
0	The authour meerly states the obvious within this story of shortness. This exerpt mainly mainly means that when spring arrives she will return to the Green house or area with all the plants. When she gets there, the girllwill atempt to act the plant that grews wild in her home country and bring it to her new home.
1	The reason the author concludes the story with that kind of paragraph, I think he’s trying to show saeng as the type of person to not give up and always to keep growing just like the hibiscus plant. And because she realizes that most of the things that she thought as strange before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season  that was almost familiar to her. Saeng notices that she will still have next season when the plant has grown and the geese fly into a distinctive V again
1	Minfong Ho concludes the story with this paragraph because to show how Saeng fills. In the paragraph Saeng said &quot;I will take that test again&quot; means will I go throught the same stuff. Also @CAPS1
0	The author ends the story this way to show that there can always be a happy ending. The geese came back  and the girl was happ because of  it.
2	The author concluded the story with his paragraph because these are all things that she isnt going to give up on.She is trying to say that when everything she believes in successed thats when she is going to take her driving test.Her mother says that the flower is never going ti give up and it’s strong enough to live through the winter.The geese are going to always come back.That is exactly what she is going to do with her test.She is not going to give up on the test,she is going to keep trying untill she passes.
6	Dear Newspaper @CAPS1, I, a member of the public is writing a letter to you to inform you what I think about on the subject of if people spend to much time on the computer. My first idea is sometimes people do spend to much time on the computer than usual. Its a problem because some people began to become over wieght &amp; start to lose control over the eating habits. My second idea is computers do alot of things for us. But there are still alot of things a computer cant teach us how to do. So computers are helpful but they're not always find something to do outside but whats sometimes different with a computer. My last &amp; final idea is people become to attached to their computers &amp; lose sight of what really matter, such as exercising &amp; fitnesss. Then people are angry when their computer chrashes &amp; forget how to do things because their always on the computer. And those are my ideas on the subject about if people spend to much time on the computer but not as much time with friends and family.
1	Saeng feels more comfirtable in the spring because it reminds her of home. She probably never experienced snow or winter before. So nothing in this time of year reminds her of home. In the spring it does because the geese return and the hibiscus grow again making everything feel like its her home again. Conferdence is what she receives when spring comes again. 
2	The author concludes the story, ”Winter Hibiscus,” with that paragraph because it sums up everything the hibiscus has given Saeng for strength and courage. Just like the hibiscus, Saeng felt out of place in this new country and the hibiscus helps her realize the importance in adapting to her survival in order to live happily. She can’t alway be dwelling in the past but learn to like where she lives now. Therefore, when the author writes, “In the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,” it is a direct symbol of Saeng budding or opening her mind to the @CAPS1 ways, like learning to drive. 
3	I believe the author of “winter Hibiscus” used this for the last paragraph because it is saying when she sees that hibiscus it will give her memories of home again which will bring encouragement for the test. “The geese symbolize Saeng's determination to pass the test and try like the new country. Saeng explains, “she lifted her head and watched as their distinctive I was etched against the evening sky, slowly fading into the @NUM1) this quote creates a vivid image in my mind that lets me know Saeng will really go and take that test when she has encouragement from not only the geese but the hibiscus also.
2	The author concludes with that paragraph because it is in a way letting you know that everything’s going to be alright. Saeng is going to retry her drivers test again and everything is back to the way she likes best.It gives you a sense of hope, that everything is going to be alright wi her. Also, that she is going to start making the best out of life. I believe it’s saying to that is why I think the author concludes wi that paragraph.
1	The Author uses this paragraph to @CAPS1 the Story because it shows how Saeng wants to adapt to this country and she is allready beging to understand it and like it. When it @CAPS2 “and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again” It is a metaphor about herself when the @CAPS3 begins to bloom and @CAPS4 Just as she is starting to bloom and @CAPS4. This is why the Author endeded with this passage.
1	Saeng said that when the tree she bought starts budding she will take the test over. She means that without that plant she just does not feel like taking the test. She does not because the plant was with her, her whole life. She also thinks that she can not do it, without that plant. Saeng means that since she’s had a plant like that her whole life then she thinks she needs it, but I don’t think she really needs it. I guess it just “comforts” her.
0	The author didn’t think that Saeng was ready to take the test until she knew more about it. Saeng had a lot on her mind of gardening since she didn’t have any friends in school she didn’t want to go their the would have nobody to talk to its good that Saeng vowed because she will never know if she would do good or bad, So the author realized that Saeng will take the test and pass.
2	The author concludes with this paragraph mostly because she wants to emphasize her memoreies of her homeland by saying that she would take the test again driving the next spring. This is due to that fact that she knows as soon as spring comes back there will be a lot of memories coming back to her since during spring animals come out and trees blossom making it all beautifu for her to take the test again with support from her memories of her country.
3	After reading the story “Winter Hibiscus” by: Minfong Ho the author ends the story in a unique way that demonstrates a will to survive. For example in the text the author writes and explain how the plants “dok faeng-noi,” has adapted to its cold environment is different to the ones back at home. This demonstrates the idea of survival be the fact that in the past this plant migrated to a place that seemed warm at the time, but when cold streets, it found ways to change itself and adapt all based on the instinct to survive. Another example in the text is the author     Saeng telling herself that in the spring she will try and take the test again. This demonstrates the will to survive because when Saeng failed the test she felt a sense of meloncoly and failure. The fact that she had the courage to prepare for the test in spring shows how she human being wants to live and for her to live in a new country she must adapt by passing that test to become a survivor.
0	The author concludes. the story with this paragraph to show the story about snows on the roads. He shows people how to watch where they are going. In conclusion, the paragraph would show he made through the snow storm.
11	Dear @LOCATION1, I want you to imagine it's a beautiful @DATE1 day. The birds are chirping, the smell of beautiful flowers are filling the air, but instead of playing outside with your neighbors, you are inside trying to master the unbeatable game cubefield on the computer. Computers have had a negative impact on today's society. When people are engrossect with whatever they @MONTH1 be doing on the computer they become very lazy, they lose the motivation to go out and exercise, people also lose intrest in helping around the community. This is why computers have a negative impact on todays society. Statics shows that @PERCENT1 of people would rather stay instead on the computer then out and about helping and working around their neighboorhood. Computers have had such a negative impact it makes people want to stay glued to their chairs with their eyes glued to their monitors. Yes computers have had a lot to do with a lot of technical advances, but at what cost do these technological advances come? Many kids are becoming obese and lack my motivation to come out of their room off of the computer. Computers are making society very lazy this is why they have a negative impact on us. Computers have also made society lack motivation to go and exercise. A very close family friend was very obese. She was lazy and never wanted to exercise. Instead of going out and doing something about it, she stayed in her room on facebook for weeks at a time. Though the computer wasnt the one who made her obese, it was used as a much to hide behind the real problems. It is sad when @PERCENT2 of teenagers say they would rather stay inside on myspace than going outside for a jogg. Yes its true computers helps you learn things you @MONTH1 not have known before, but so do books, newspapers and magazines. Computers have had a negative impact on society. Helping out in your community provides many opportunties to meet new people, and it feel a sense of accomplishment. But the urge to stay in on the computer clouds your better judgement. I know that I would rather help the elemntry school across the street build a new garden rather than stay inside on twitter. If you are inside searching the web how will you know if the old lady across the street needs help with her groceries? Helping around your community lets people know you care about whats going on. So dont let the computer have another second of your time. Computers have had a negative impact on society. Teenagers as well as adults have become very lazy. They lack motivation to exercise as well as help around the community. Now its your turn don't just stare at your computer screen absent mindley. Go out and toss the ball along with the neighbors dog. Youve heard the facts now make the right decision.
3	In the story “ Winter Hibiscus “ Saeng vowes to herself in the spring, when the snow melts and geese return and the hibiscus is budding. then I will take the test again. The author concludes   with this paragraph because the hibiscus brings her comfort from home and confidence. “Almost  familiar to her now.” This quote from the story shows that things are starting to be right and she is starting to feel comforting her by making her relize that where she is living now can be similar to where she used to live. When around the hibiscus it brings back memorys of the flowers that   they used to have where they lived. Both the mother and the daughter appreciate the flower they found because it is similar to what they had back home. For example, in the story the mother says “Its flowers aren’t as pretty, but its strong enough to make it through the cold months here.” This shows that they appreciate its similarity to the old hibiscus. In conclution the author concludes this story with that paragraph because it helps readers to understand the importance of the  girls memory of where she used to live.
3	The author choose this end to show that saeng hasn't given up on how she is living yet. It shows that even though she really loved her hometown, and feels and remembers a lot back then. She had taken the test and failed, living where she was living then just seemed too much pressure on her. Although she hasn't quite adapted throughly she will try her best to surcome situations that are brought upon her. It gives the reader hope by ending the story like this, instead of just leaving the reader at she bought a flower after failing a test and moves on with her life. For example when she failed the test she seemed distressed and very angry. I,”I-I failed the test,” Saeng said. For a long moment mrs. Panouvong said nothing. Saeng did not dare look her mother in the eye. Instead, she stared at the hibiscus plant and nervously tore off a leaf, shedding it to bits.”it anger Saeng how she had to leave her happy past life for one that is different and challenging. When faced with a challenge extreme emotiona situations occur. Saeng just needed hope and the author choose this to betray to then reader there is a chance of hope!
0	In the story Winter Hibiscus the author minfong to ends the story as she does for many reasons.
1	The auther cncludes the story with this paragraph because it wraps it all up and sums it into one. It is explaining that she is looking forward to the spring when the hibiscuss is
1	The reason why at the end of the story she ended it with &quot;when they came back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring; when the shows melt &amp; the gees return &amp; this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the again”. is because shes making the statement that the birds have where they live all the time &amp; the plant can live here &amp; not when she has &amp; still live shes saying she can to if she tries so she will wait till birds came back are ok the plant buds living in her new home so everything will be okey then she will be able to take the test because she understand &amp; believe she will feel safer &amp; a lot better.
1	The story like this for mine reasons. First of all he ended the story to make the readers think about what will happen if there is a part two. Secondly, so he can make a part two. That is way he ended the story like that.
1	She vowed this because just as the geese would return she shall. also as the test themselves to learn and grow she would. Furthermore she @CAPS1 the the test of love, survial and family tridition she would know that comeing. back was destiny. In example they come to raise their young for the journey that they shall face and Help them to  realise that they always will come back because their lives started there and to always exacpe cold and man kind that wants to harm their lives. The winter months are very harsh there so They know that they have to leave just to @CAPS2. She learns the lessons of family, freedom, life, and survival.
1	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because he made a comittment to himself of taking the test all over again. He probably said that because there’s always a next time for everything. mostly the reason he said it was to remind himself that theres always another try of everything. Finally that most people such know that everyone get a second chance.
1	The author concludes the story like this because the seasons are changing and there finising there cycle and starting a new one. Thus I think this is a good way to end a story like this because I kinda sets a mood and a feel at the end of the story.
3	The author concludes the story “Winter Hibiscus” with this paragraph because it conveys the theme of the story, adjusting to changed in life. So many things have changed for Saeng and she hasn’t full adjusted yet to the way of life. Yet she learns that she needs to be determined to adapt and survive like Hibiscus. The text states, “In the spring, when this hibiscus is budding” The hibiscus teaches Saeng to never give up, like the hibiscus doesn’t give up and survives during the winter. She learns to be determined and even though she failed the test the first time, her memories have helped her and she is going to go for it again. These ideas are in the last paragraph because they summarize the idea of not giving up even if you feel out of place. She has slowly gotten used to this new place and recognizes the seasons now as she thinks this last thought.
9	Dear newspaper and readers of @LOCATION1, I am @PERSON1, a student from @ORGANIZATION1, I have recently been enformed about the argument over computer use and I feel it is silly. We need computers in life to help us do jobs, communicate with family or friends traveling the world, and for research on homework. First of all, without computers many people would struggle. My father uses a computer for his job and he couldn't do his job without one. Sure, many people spend way to much time on their computer, but other people use it to save information or find research. I know people argue that computers should be used less, but could you get through a week without using one computer? Most people couldn't, especially if you own a buisness. In addition, from using computers for jobs, some people like to chat online with a friend that move away. Imagine if your family member or friend traveled constantly and they went to places where they couldn't get connection on their cell phone, the only way to talk to them is chating through the web. I'm sure everyone has used a computer once to talk to a friend or for something related to buisness, so they are more useful than people relize. Lastly, as a kid we need to be able to use a computer, not just to talk to friends but for homework. Some homework requires us to make powerpoints, write a paper on historical facts, and we need computers to do so. Without computers, kids wouldn't be able to gather facts or information to write a paper. Decreasing computer use for kids can potentialy bring down their grades. My teacher always says, &quot;grades are the most imfortant thing.&quot; I'm sure all parents would agree with that. All in all, we can't decrease the use of computers because it can do damage to peoples lives. Think about people who travel alot, kids with work that needs to be done, and parents with jobs that they need computers for, don't upset all of these people by decreasing computer time. Thank you for your time,
1	To set a tone and to talk about how they look. Also that little paragraph can also start another book or to get you into studing things. It could also compare Your life with the geeses life. Like explaning what hardships you went through.
2	The author chooses to end this story like this for many reasons. Throughout the story, the author gives you hints of Saeng being homesick. He relates this to the flower being strong enough to survive the winter months. Meaning she’ll survive also. Although the flower isn’t the same as she had at home, change is inevitable and atleast she could hold on to that. So I believe the author decides to end the story with this to say just like the plant she’ll survive and try to adjust in the spring also like her driving test.     
0	The author concluded like that because he was the one to score the lines below what you write. Score of to level and key better. To all the thing he was surprised to kindly be seprated by for there by up so blese geve one a high sew o of will sweit all at you up to the end of the authrs concludes 
1	I belive that the author included this paragraph to show that you she didn't give up, to show that she kept trying after she failed. Saeng said to her mother &quot;I failed the test&quot;. Also to make her sound proud and happy to try the test over again. Also I have failed test. I also said that I would take them over but I didn't. So the author put that in their to show how determin she was going to sound.
3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it lets the reader know that there is still a chance for Saeng; she is not giving up on herself or the test. While reading you will find that Saeng is comforted by memories of her homeland, and obviously this move to another country was hard on her. In the story the author writes, “It felt smooth and cool, with a hint of velvet toward the center- just as she had known it would feel.” The feeling and scent of the hibiscus flower comforted her. She then proceeded to purchase the plant, because she failed the test she needed something to lift her spirits back up once again. The author decided to end the story with Saeng stating that once “this hibiscus plant is budding,then l will take that test again” because as the reader should have learned by now, the hibiscus plant has been the only positive aspect in her life since the move. It is giving her motivation to once again take the driver’s test, and it is also letting the reader know that Saeng is not giving up.
3	Minfong Ho concluded the story “Winter Hibiscus” with a strong paragraph to show the passion and will of Saeng in her new home to complete the test. When the closing sentences states that Saeng “vowed” to pass the test, it shows her determination to fight. This will could be from the memories of her grandmother and the flowers that reminded her so closely of her old home. Saengs courage to face her homesickness is the seed of the story, and by ending it with such a bold statement, Minfong Ho blooms this seemingly sad tale into a story of willpower and drive to pass her test. “Winter Hibiscus” is a passage of heartache, despair, and yerning for a past life. By closing the story with the uplifting promise from Saeng, Minfong Ho puts a happy ending to a possibly sad tale.
0	The author concludes the story with this because the season is ending and also the story is ending.
1	The author concludes the story with this type of paragraph because the author knows it’s bond to happen again. I know this because in that paragraph it says “in the spring………….I will take this test again”. She is just preparing herself for next year. This is why I think this paragraph ended with the story.
1	Saeng was thinking to herself after dinner about the test. She knew that she can do much better than before. And she made a vowed to herself saying that once winter finally ends and spring start, she would take the test again, and this time she will pass it with flying colors.
2	Saeng wants to take the test again when it is beautiful out and the hibiscus is buddy. The plant shows the beautiful achievement of passing the test. The plant will help her past the test by being strong, tough, and nicely finished. These characteristics reprecent the girl and the flower. The day was a good day and wants to take the test on the same day. The plant was strong and tought. This represents the girl in that time she didn’t pass. She told her mother and was very understandig about it. The plant represents beautiful things and the geese represent beautiful things. The girl wants to do that on that time of day and thinks she will get it next time. When she completes and past her test she wants to come home to the beautiful surroundings to remember that day. The author concluded with that statement to represent the importance of the plant and the surroundings of when she wants to past the test.
10	Knoleg is one of the greatest quests for mankind, always trying to figure out how and why things happen. @CAPS1 to this natural ciricusity we have made amazing leaps in Technology @NUM1 years ago what seemed to be imposible is now possible. And one of those many thought to be impossible was to find anything you want in only a matter of seconds. I think computers are a great benafate to society becaus, you can learn things around the world in the blink of an eye, allow you to talk to people around the world and @CAPS5 give you better hand eye cordenation. The first reson I think that computers are great modern society, is that we can learn instantly about foren countrys. @NUM1 years ago the only way you could learn about places far away was if you read it in a newspaper, many which didn't tell you about faraway lands. Now with the internet we can learn around the world what is happening ware you want to know. &quot;@CAPS1 to our modern techolagy people are now more informed about the rest of the world than ever befor.&quot; stated @PERSON3, a @CAPS2 expert from @ORGANIZATION2 university of @CAPS2. &quot;@CAPS4 computers and the ability to colect information @CAPS7 quily compared to @NUM1 years ago.&quot; @CAPS5 @CAPS9 computers we wouldn't have known anything about the recent earth quake in @CAPS6. @CAPS5 with computers we can now talk istantly with people over the internet. A century ago talking to people instantly seemed just about impossible. But @CAPS1 to technology that of thing is an avarage part of our lives.&quot; @CAPS7 many of our advancements and dicisions are made while we talk online, even some of the worlds gratests leaders make the hard decisions becaus of this advansments,&quot; stated @PERSON1, a reporter for the new @CAPS8 times. &quot;@CAPS9 this technology many of the decisions made in @LOCATION1 and @CAPS10 wouldn't be made and many solders would have died as a result.&quot; @CAPS11 final reson that I support this decision is that they help teach you hand eye coordination. One of the ways that computers teach hand eye coordination is throug video games and simulations. In video games people make it @CAPS7 you to react at a movements notes in order to compleat your objective. In the @ORGANIZATION1 computer simulations teach the soldiers how to react to many different situations. Through this situations, many sledres have learn how to servive in combat and save many of their fellow comredes. &quot;The simulations we have invested in have improved combat effectevness by over @PERCENT1&quot; stated general @PERSON2 of the @LOCATION2 @CAPS12. &quot;@CAPS9 theise simulations many more american lives weold have ben lost in recent wars.&quot; @CAPS14 now that you have heard all of @CAPS11 resons of why I support computers. I hope you are much more informed about this topic @CAPS9 computers we wouldn't be able to learn about foren lands, talk to people instantly, or have as good hand eye cooordination. I hope everyone else will see @CAPS11 resons for supporting computers.
1	The author might have concluded the story with that paragraph, because she wanted to remind the reader how sincearl, &quot;Saeng&quot; was to the hibiscus flower. I say this because through out the story @PERSON1 was very compassionate about the flower. I think she felt as through she could relate to the flower.
2	The author ends with this paragraph because it symbolizes a new beggining, Saeng says, “I – I failed the test.” She is also really sad, she is making a commitment to get a fresh start on life, just like how the world does every spring. The theme of the story is when life seems hard take a new approach. She intends to retake the drivers test.
2	The author concludes the story with this to show that Saeng will be ready to take the test in time. She first has to grow and adapt to the new surroundings. Just like the hibiscus flower and the geese. The hibiscus flower now has to adapt to its new surroundings outside of the store The geese are adapting to the surroundings by flying south for the winter. Saeng needs to still learn more and adapt before she can pass her drivers test. By ending the story with this paragraph it shows that Saeng realizes what she needs to do. She needs to stop thinking about where she used to live and begin her new life in a new country.
2	Minfong Ho ended her story &quot;Winter Hibiscus&quot; with an optomistic sentence. She concluded it this way because the main character of the story was beginning to lose hope. Saeng decided to retake the driving test when her hibiscus flower was blooming. This flower reminds her of her past life in Vietnam with her grandmother. &quot;Saeng could almost feel the light strands of her grandmother's long gray hair, freshly washed, as she combed it out with the fine-toothed buffalo-horn comb&quot;. She preferred her life in Vietnam than hers in @LOCATION2. She was goint to wait until &quot;this hibiscus is budding,&quot; so she can feel more comfortable and happy. The author wanted to end it so Saeng would be happy. 
2	The author ended the story with that because she is sad and she wants to give hope to the reader that you should never give up on any thing, always keep trying. Also it ends on a good note, if was like I stayed up in my @CAPS1 crying that would not be good ending. This ending gives hope to the reader and it also tells the reader to practice. This is because when spring comes a end the lady is going to practice driving so when she takes the test she want fail. Also the girl is getting happier at the end and that makes the reader happy. So in conclusion that ending for story has a good choose for many reasons, like making the reader happy, giving the reader couage to never give up, end to practice something if you fail it the first time. Also to help your mother when she is planting or digging up plant,
2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph in order to develop the theme and to project what the main character will do after she plants the hibiscus, I believe that the theme of this story is adjusting to changes in life and the author builds upon this theme in the final paragraph. In the ending paragraph, the author writes, “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” The author demonstrates how Saeng learns to adjust when things change in her life. In this instance, Saeng fails her driver’s test and to deal with this setback, she buys a hibiscus to remind her of her homeland. The hibiscus symbolizes a new start test once the geese ??? (THIS @CAPS1 IS @CAPS2)
1	So she did not forget to take the test again.
1	Saeng did not give up on herself. She said she would take it over again then she might pass it. You will not always pass on your first try it takes a while sometime. Saeng encourage you to never to give up just cause you did not get it on your first time. She also builds confidence in herself. That’s why the author concluded the story that way.
2	The author ended the story with the paragraph of Saeng vowing to retake the test in the spring, because he wanted to show that the geese and the hibiscus plant represent a sort of rebirth or revival to Saeng. He wanted to end the story on a positive note. Spring is an archotyal season. It is a season of birth and growing. Saeng saw the hibiscus after she failed the first test. It took her to her memories back in Vietnam, which comforted here she believes that maybe when she sees the plant florishing and she geese returning, she will experience that same revival again.
2	The author concludes the story with the last paragraph because Saeng failed the test at the beginning of the story. After going through the plants and learned new things, it is natural for Saeng to take the test again in the spring(end of the story).  I think this because Saeng  learned that she has  to get used to hung in @LOCATION1 and the plant remainded her  that she has to when  she saw the geese fly in the &quot;V&quot;formation,it was the same as back at home in Vietnam. She realized that it was the same as Vietnam and she has to take that driver's test again in order to get used to living in @LOCATION1 with all of its changes. I also think that its prayer to end the story with her taking the driver's test in spring because the geese will come back,and the hibiscus is budding. This is the beginning for them as well as Saeng.                                                                                                       
10	Dear @LOCATION1, @CAPS1 you all @MONTH1 know many people in our town have been quarreling about computers. Some people are pro computer useage and others not so much. In my opinoin computers are a great @CAPS2 technology. One way computers benefits our society is ability to access ample information, pictures, and news. Also you can chat with @CAPS2 or old friends. Another good thing about computers is you can also have fun on the web, watch movies, even go shopping. Have you ever done a report on on a far away country? Maybe you've never heard of @LOCATION2 or @CAPS2 @CAPS3. So wat do you do? Serch the web! Instead of taking a walk to the libriary just serch one of the many serch engines such @CAPS1 @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS4, @ORGANIZATION2 or @CAPS5! @PERCENT1 of people nowadays have at least one maybe two computers in their household. @PERCENT2 of people can access the web on their cell phone! Can you believe this? Pictures are also accessable on the web. You could @CAPS12 just about anything in the picture search engine. Have you ever wandered about current events in our country or others? On certain cites you can live newsfeeds or an article about something @CAPS2 such @CAPS1 the earthquake in @LOCATION4 that recently happended. The internet is benefitting our society today. Aim is just one of many private chat rooms that is avalible to people. On these open chat rooms you can talk to people that are thousands of miles away. &quot;I was on @CAPS6 looking for my friend @CAPS7 and I found her page before this year we didn'@CAPS8 talk @CAPS1 much but now we can talk through face book we hangout and talk all the time!&quot; comments @LOCATION3 avid @CAPS6 user. Dating cites are now avalible, too. There you can meet @CAPS2 people a develope a relationship with them. Entertainment is everywhere on the internet. You can play a variety of games, watch missed episodes of your favorite @CAPS8.V show, streame live movies, watch viddeos on @CAPS9, and much more! Many people think there are only pointless games on the comuter but there are educational fun games @CAPS1 well such @CAPS1 @CAPS10, @CAPS11, and @CAPS12 to learn. Did you know that more than @PERCENT3 of shopping for clothes car parts and other things are bought an auction such @CAPS1 ebay and amazon? I recall a time when my dad and I was going to see or movie but we weren'@CAPS8 sure wat was playing or what times they started at. So we simply looked on the cinema's website. So now you now where I stand on the issue of computers. Computers are a great reference point, can allow you to chat with
1	The author ends the story with this paragraph show is that Saeng is willing to try again to try to get a plant that will remind her of her grand mother and  remind her of her old home where she @MONTH1 go back one day . So, she can see the near flower she loves and not the take   one.
2	In “Winter Hibiscus” the author concludes the story the way he does to show that Saeng isn’t giving up. In the spring she will see the plant and remember her home which will help her not feel as homesick. “Plants she had not even realized she had known but had forgotten drew her back into her childhood work.” This quote shows that when she sees familiar plants she is reminded of home, so in the spring when her plant blooms she will see it and feel more comforting and more at home which will help her find the strength to pass the driving test. So as the plant blooms, so does her comfort level.
0	What l think the author was talking abount snow and it was add outside for the bays matter and snow started to melted.
1	He concluded the story with that sentence because it told that she learned a lesson in life. all the way back home where she originally came from she missed her friends ibet and seeing her mother work out in the garden durring this time of year when its cold. I guess there poor in one way. In conclusion the choose this sentence because it sounds like she learned a lesson in life and even starting all over again but with a better understanding in her learning.
1	Saeng says this in the paragraph because she wants to make her mother proud of her so she is going to take the test again after winter.
2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it is more will power because she loves the hibiscus and what other way to end the story that have her comparing he self to the hibiscus because when she say  “in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” She is is saying now this snow is slowing down the hibiscus. So the fail is slowing her down. So she is going to be reading to prepare for when the spring comes when the hibiscus is budding then she will be budding too by passing her test.
2	  In the article the author concludes the story with Saeng vowing to herself that “in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is bidding, then I will take that test again” because the spring and the hibiscus reminds her of home. For example in the article she gets shaky because she cant say home because she misses it too much. So she finds things that reminds her of it like a plant called dok faeng-noi. It’s not the real plant but she gets it to remind her where she comes from. In conclusion, Saeng finds a plant, she likes the soring because it reminds her home. How about what reminds you of home. Think about it.
1	The reason that the author chose to end this story with this paragraph is to tell the reader that things get better as time goes on. Saeng failed the driver’s test because she wasnt ready. The flower bloomed before it was ready. The author is saying you need to be patient and good things will come your way
3	The author chose to conclude the paragraph with the sentence &quot;when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring , when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.&quot; because it shows how the strenghth of the hibiscus is related to Saeng's strenghth. In the story, after failing her drivers test, Saeng @CAPS1 comfort in a hibiscus native to her country. when she gets home her mother says “I’ve seen this kind blooming along the lake. Its flowers aren't as pretty, but its strong enough to make it through the cold months here.&quot; This shows that saeng is faltiering in her new foriegn country. The end quote sums up that saeng @CAPS1 strenghth in the strenghth of the flowers. almost thinking if flower can survive in a land away from its home, why can't I?&quot;
1	When she is ready and good she is saying she will take the test again. When she is ready and good and it is nice and beautiful out then she will have the confidence to take the test again. The author was trying to tell us how she felt about letting her mom down.
8	Dear Newspaper, I think computers are great. There really helpful. They can teach us about things. Also they have fun games and websites which is always a plus. Computers are helpful in lots of things, like if you need to look something up for school you can just easily go on the computer and find it also some teachers have websites now where insted of bringing a big social studies book home, you can go on the internet and use the online book. Did you know that @PERCENT1 of @CAPS1 students rather use the internet book then taking the actual one home. Also if you forgot to write down your homework theres a website to lookup all the homework you have. Also computers can teach us things. There are websites that have math games and school related things. Also you can easilly go on google and look up things and they can give you thousands of information. Lastly the internet is a good source for fun they have millions of games on the internet and also fun websites like facebook. Did you know @PERCENT2 of @CAPS1 students use the computer for the games and online talking. This also gives kids lots of things to do on a rainy day. So weither your using the internet for it's helpfulness its resources, or just for the fun games and websites. Computers are really helpful.
8	@ORGANIZATION1, In the @DATE1 computers have help man kinds. Computers are every where in a schools, homes band business across a @CAPS1. They help people in many ways depending on the what the person wants to set done. The ways that I use my computer is by staying in contact with my friends, a family, and it also helps me with my school work. I have been a live for @NUM1 @DATE1 and have already live in @NUM2 different states: @LOCATION3, @LOCATION1, @LOCATION2, and now @CAPS2 you would think I would have had lots of friends living in so many places. How do I stay in contact with them you @MONTH1 use? I use various and @CAPS3. If you get rid of computers I would not be able to stay in contact with tem anymore. Moving from place to place was very hard and sad thing to do for me. Another hard thing to do for me was moving away from my family, but thank to technology and computers I stay in contact with them. Imagine you haven't seen you family in @NUM3 @DATE1, well sadly thats my life so many birthday @CAPS4 all the family you can see is you parents. School another great example where society benefits from computers students and teachers use them everyday to learn. In my opoion learning is the greatest thing. One of my friends, @PERSON1, said this about the dell computers we use in the library @CAPS4 ever u don't get something about what we learned in @CAPS5 class that day. I use the computers to better understand it. Computers are a great way to research a topic, and thats why they should not be gotten rid of. I use computers every day for two reasons for school, researching or writing a project for any of my classes. Everyday I spend at least @NUM4 our writing something up for school. Computers help lessen the time spend writing it because it is fast and easy it is easy to type something, like a @CAPS6 paper on the ways to persuassive the readier. In the end computers are something we I need in are life because it makes life simpler. If I was to send a message to some of my friends in @LOCATION2 through @CAPS7 it would take seconds. Instead if I was to use the @ORGANIZATION2 it would take days. A life with out computers is a lot harder to do things, that we cant make simpler with computers&quot;
1	The author concludes the story with this paragraph, because it's important to the story. Also it closes the story up. Its exploning that the girl is starting to adjust to the new area, and is going to try harder to get along well there. So by saying shes going to take the test again. It means shes going to look at it in a new way. The authur put this at the end trying to make sense of everything and show the girl had changed.
1	In the short story “Winter hibiscus” The author concludes the story with this paragraph because the author felt as thought Saeng would be ready to take thee test at that particular time.
1	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because its showing she still has hope. The hibiscus gives her hope and strength. In the spring she will take her test again and will hope to pass it. This is why the author concludes the story with this paragraph.
2	In the last paragraph of &quot;Winter Hibiscus&quot; by minfong Ho The author concludes by saying  &quot;when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again&quot;. I think the author concludes with this quote because it shows her determination to overcome this obstacle, For Saeng the hibiscus represents comfort and the ability to over come. Saeng is very strong and she believes off of that determination which comes from her past. The author concluded with that because it shows Saeng’s determination.
2	In the story &quot;Winter Hibiscus&quot; by Minfong Ho the author ends the story it that paragraph to show how meaningful that flower is to Saeng. The text stated, &quot;@CAPS1 in the garden, Saeng dig out a hole and carefully lowered the &quot;winter Hibiscus&quot; into it.&quot; This shows the reader that it is very meaningful to Saeng to have this plant in her garden. Also by having that conclusion statement it help the reader understand the affection of her new country. Also the conclusion paragraph shows comfort at a time of disappointment. In the story it said, &quot;Its flowers aren't as pretty, but it's strong enough to make it through the cold months here, this winter hibiscus. This also shows the connection of Saeng and the flower and how it helps her through everything.
1	Why I think she added this is because she needs time to grow like the plant before she takes the test again. Sometimes you need more time to pass your test. going through school teaches more than stuff we need to know it helps us grow up, and how to understand life. I know myself as a tenth grader that I understand life more than I did in first. She still has a lot of growing mentaly about her past and preasnt.
3	I believe that the author ended the story with this line to show that hope for the girl was still there and that even perhaps the flower had inspired her a lot. I believe that when she says &quot;when they come back, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again&quot;, She specifically chose this time for her to start over, and try again just as everything else mentioned is. When it says, &quot;and this hibiscus is budding&quot;, it shows that the flower is blooming again, with a fresh start and beginning again just as she would try to do when she tries again to succed at passing the test she must pass. also the tone of which said said this showed hope, she was hopeful and determined that next time around she would certainly pass.
1	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show that while this particular tale is over Saeng’s life will continue. The paragraph provides closure for the reader as well as explains that in time Saeng will take the test again, once she has further adapted to @LOCATION1 culture.
0	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because wants her to be successful and do good.
0	In the response that explains why the author concludes the story with this paragraph is because this story was about a plant growing back every year around the same time. The paragraph ment like I think when the plant came back inspring &amp; the geese would come back around it be another test of growing and not letting the plant die
8	In my opinion I think that computers have a good affect on people. I think this because about millions of people use computers everyday! The affects on them are that people get learn things easier. There are millions of a job sites that would have to do with something of learning. About @NUM1 of collage students go online and do challenge. If you were a collage student and did collage online you would: see your family more won't be a hassle to get to collage and would be easier to concentrate being by your self and learning. Also they even make stone which is very popular learning a different language and where you learn this from is on a computer. My second reason is to talk on the . About @NUM2 of our daily! Online phone you and you can also the cool them even more that have you talk to give . I know have a facebook give don't get think it would be a good chore. up free. So in conclusion I think that there good effects on people that use cpu. Also when everyone that uses their cpu they still enjoy the nature talk to thier family . So if you don't have a cpu you get one and will do other fun stuff you like.
2	From the story, “Winter Hibiscus,” by Minfong Ho, the author concludes this story with the paragraph of what Saeng vowed silently because it is to show Saeng’s determination. The hibiscus was the plant she found, that was closly resembled the one at “home,” to symbolize her conformt. The hibiscus symbolized her determination in life. “through the quiet repetiton of season upon season, almost familiar to her now” from this, you can conclude that Saeng is thinking of how she reconignzed the geese. It gives her greater confidence within herself. From this, “like the Geese she lifited her head and watched as their distinctive v was etched,&quot; and this explains that there is still hope inside of her. This paragraph conclusion the author had concluded ties together what Saeng is now hoping and believing in.
2	Saeng vows this to herself at the end of the story to show that she will adapt to this change, just like the hibiscus will bud. She knows that it will be hard and take time, but in the end she will achieve approval and happiness. We see that it is already hard for her by the way she breaks down crying. And the way she talks to her mother. She symbolizes by planting the hibiscus that things are going to get better if she is not too stuck in the past.
2	The author concludes the paragraph with a statement that Saeng said. It was a very good statement. The author ended with this to show that she is motivated and determined to do this. She shows she is motivated in many ways. she says, “Here let me help you mother.” This shows that she is motivated by helping her mother finish what she started. She is also determined by saying, “almost reluctantly she realizes that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through a quiet repitition of season upon season, almost familier now.” This shows that she wants to do something and she doesn’t think it is weird anymore. That is why the author concludes that statement.
1	The Author concludes the story with this When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is building then I will take that test again! because he or she are the ones who wrote the story. One information is her family moved to the united @ORGANIZATION1 from Vietnam. Second one is the Author could of made this story it was about her. Saeng fails her driving test.    
3	The author concludes the “Winter Hibiscus” with that paragraph to show the narrator realizes that even though she’s in a new country, some things are still the same. So she becomes determined to pass the test. For example, the narrator said, “she realized that many of the things that she had thought of are strange before had become, through the quick repetition of season upon season familiar to her now.”  This quote shows that the narrator has realized that even though aspects of how life has changed, some things remain same. This also shows that some things like the test were strange to her but now that she is familiar with it she could pass it. The narrator also said, “Saeng did not dare look at her mother in her eyes.” This quote shows that the narrator was disappointed with herself for not passing the test. This means that the test was very important to her with the  of pressure to pass, and of a new is ready to pass the test. But she’ll be more prepared. The theme of this story could be seen things discourage you. The narrator has gone through recently many but in the seasons.
2	The author shows a willingness to try harder in this story. She states that, “In the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” I think the author realizes that she is going to have to adapt. Also, saying that she will wait till the spring, means she is going to try again, and not give up. The author has a sentimental value to. Insince she is waiting for the hibiscus to bud, I believe she is referring that hibiscus to her country. Insince she has left her country, the hibiscus is the closet thing she has to it, and therefore, she will wait with the flower
2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show that Saeng now thinks about images associated with memories in her new home, as well as images she remembers from Vietnam. At the beginning of the story, in the floral shop, she remembers her grandmother, as well as a well, a hibiscus hedge, and other things that remind her of certain feelings and experiences. At the end of the story, she uses both the hibiscus, which reminds her of her previous home, and the canadian geese, which don't seem so unfamiliar to her anymore, to represent passing of time. She now sees her new home as having familiar things in it attached to memories, as her old love did.
2	The aurthor concludes the story with this paragraph. In same ways. One reason why the aurthor concluded the story with this paragraph is because in the story she sad something she really wanted. So she took it home and showed her mom, Then her mom look at her weird, because in the story it said that “you what? Her mother stared at her increously.” So then she explains that she failed the drivers test, but she didn’t give up. So at the end of the story she said that she will take that test again. So in conclusion that is why the aurthor concludes the story with this paragraph.
2	The story elds with &quot;when they come back, Saeng vowed sileltly to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again. &quot;The author concludes with this to show determination to try again and to pass her driving test next year. Also the flowers reminded her of home in Vietnam. (for example, &quot;Plants that she had not even realized she had known but had forgotten drew her back into childhood world.&quot;) and by next year when the flowers bloomed she would more determined and ready for the test again. Also, the flowers blooming resembels starting a new life and maybe it could be the same way for Saeng by passing her drivers test. That's why the auther ends with that statement.
1	I think the auther concludes the story with the paragraph because it is saying I’ll never give up. She is determined to concor everything. I think she is saying she will take the test over and over until she succeeds. That is why the author concludes the story with this paragraph because you should never give up.
10	@ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1 computers were invented they have grown so much, which make a lot @ORGANIZATION1 people use them more. More and More people use computers, but not everyone agrees that this benefits society. Those who suffort advances in technology believe that computers have a positive effect on people, but there are negative effects too. I believe that computers are a negative effect on people vecause people spend too much time on computer; not exercising, there are many dangers, and less interacting with family and friends. First @ORGANIZATION1 all, a negative effect computers have on people is that they spend too much time on the computer and that leads to less exercise. Recently, @CAPS3 spoke to a local @CAPS2 about this issue and she spoke out, @CAPS3 have one family computer and my son is the one who is always on it right after school to late at night.&quot; This shows that many children are on a computer too much. I have to input that I personally sit on my computer at times and not even realize two hours past. I try to cut back on my computer times, but it doesn't really work out. Sitting on the computer for hours everyday is also looking exercise. The hours used up on the computer could be the time in which you are exercising. someone's health is very important now. Spending too much time on the computer and not getting exercise is a major negative effect computers have on people. Secondly, the most concern parents have @ORGANIZATION1 computers are the many dangers, which is another negative effect it has on people. Recently the new biggest site is facebook. So many people are addicted to it. Though, it isn't that safe all the time. Another new thing is oovoo or skype, which allows you to talk to someone with webcam. There could be a time when a teen &quot;meets&quot; someone on-line and agree to do things on the webcam for someone they don't really know to see. These sites aren't safe, and knowing youngs they can in danger. @CAPS3 spoke to some researchers about this and they would agree that these sites are @PERCENT1 dangerous to young teens. All these dangerous risks as another negative effect computers have on people. Lastly, another negative effect computers have on people is there is less interactions with family and friends. Instead @ORGANIZATION1 getting together with a friend people just go on the computer to talk. That isn't the same as an actual get together. I actually enjoy family parties. Seeing all my aunts, uncles, and cousins it so much better and fun. I do e-mail my family and friends when I don't see them, but I get excited when @CAPS3 have get togethers. Now a day it's not like that for a lot @ORGANIZATION1 people. Many people work long times and spend too much time on the computer, which takes time away from interacting with others, and that should be more important. The computer also, negatively effects people with interacting with family and friends. In conclusion, I see computers as a negative effect on people. Computers make people spend a lot @ORGANIZATION1 time have dangerous risks, and take away interaction time. I strongly suggest you look over my terms.&quot;
2	In the story “Winter Hibiscus” the author end the story saying “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself in the spring, when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,” The author concludes the story with this paragraph because the paragraph is saying no matter what Saeng failed the drive test the first time she is not gaving up till she pass and get her driving. The author also concludes the story with this paragraph because the paragraph is saying that Saeng can wait till winter end so she see the hibiscus is budding.
2	In the story “Winter Hibiscus&quot; the author concludes in a way to relate back to the beginning conflict of the main character , failing her driver’s test.The author does this to bring the reader back and yet helps the reader foreshadow in whats going on to happen in the future, &quot;in the spring ,when the snowS melt and the geese return and hibiscus budding, then I will take the test again.&quot; @CAPS1 with this sentence  informs the reader that with the help of a plant similar to those at her homeland it will help her move on .When the hibiscus is makeing a new start by budding in the spring Saeng will do the same ,by retaking her drivers test.With this as a conclusion that author therefore is not leaving the reader confused about “What happened with the driver’s test ,what was the point of that ?”.
1	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to inform what her hole meaning was. For example when she returned she felt great b/c she came back to were she belonged. One reason is what she “vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melt and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding.” @CAPS1 meant that coming back was probably the best thing she could had done.
0	well It seems like to me that the reason why the author wrote that as his or her ending is because basically to have sarcaism and put emphesis on what he was saying and making it clear that he wasn't going to take the test again, and basically if some one would haft to kill him in order to make him take that test again.
0	The reason why I believe the author concluded the story with this paragraph is because she wants to test the hibiscus again when it returns. FOR evidence in the last paragraph it says, “when they come back saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melt and the geese return And this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” That’s why I believe the author concluded the story with this paragraph.    
1	The author puts that as the conclusion because it is like a cycle. And he didn’t finish it with the end of the cycle because leaving readers with that curiosity edge gives suspense. This was a well written story and conclusion.  
2	In the short story ’’Winter Hibiscus,’’ by Minfong Ho, a teenage girl fails a driving test but vows to take it again in the spring. The story was ended like this to show that the girl will have a new beginning. For example, ‘’When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, When the snows melt  and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then  I will take that test again’’(HO). The hibiscus is what makes her feel as though she is connected to her homeland. So if the hibiscus is budding it is starting a new beginning she feels that she will be able to do the same. This is why the story ends like that.        
1	These are a few reasons why the author concluded the story this way. The first reason is that most of the story is written in the way of a serious and stright forward tone and ending the story with a quote or riddle. Makes the reader have to think about the conclusion. It would be the same if he just  ended with what happened so he just added something that made you think a little more than a normal conclusion. The author ended the story with &quot;when they come back, saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and its hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.&quot; because it was different.
1	Because she is going to practice and get better at driving and when the flower blooms she will go take the test agin. And she will try harder next time.
10	Dear @ORGANIZATION1, I have been informed that recently, people are questioning the use of computers. Some say computers have negative effects on people when using them but I for one disagree with that statement. I believe that computers in today's society have created an atmosphere of learning, communication, and an ideal amount of creative fun. Computers are changing the way everyday people live. This technology is the basis of our future, and our future has evolved around our computers. People learn so they can become better at things, be aware of what is going on, and to gain the knowledge that possibly help mem succed in life. Computers gona access to information that people want to know whether it is to learn how it dance using youtube.com, to learn about a possible vacation spot your family might visit, or to research a topic for a school paper: computers have it all. It sits right at home so there is no need to drive to the library and wait for a book with the right researching skills, almost anybody can find the exact information they are looking for. Computers contribute to people who want to learn. Being a popular used computer have beenimportant to make them the best. Whether that means faster internet better, researching book or more websites, a computer has it all. Back before the telephones was invented, people struggled to have a reliable source of communications with where communication is important because it is the main source of communicating. Through the computer, @CAPS1, @CAPS2, and emails are easy and guarenteed ways to talk to everybody. With just a simple click of a mouse a person can talk to their bestfriend as if they were right next to them. Communication plays an important role for a civilization or society. It makes life so much easier without creating a place where people become lazy. Talking to people by using the computer has become easier and more dependable than ever. People can email their teachers if they have a question for homework, people can check there grades online, and people can talk to their friends and family all they want whenever they want. So we people say that the computer. If a sibling is away at college, their @CAPS3, when a family is to gether, they could since new things are discovered through the computer everyday. can come to a person in multiple ways. A computer can emphazize the fun is never a bad thing. Computers offer video games, learning games, and that bring creativity to. This technology gets people every to have an open mind with everything. It allows them to have fun but at the same time learn something about the world or even themselves. Sometimes computers can inspire people to do something like start a group to make the environment better or go running around ther block. Even though the actual computer is inside the fun and creativity can be whenever a person wants it to be. Computers expand a person's knowledge, allow one to communicate, and create a whole new word of fun. Researching topics can be easily accessed through a computer. Communicating with others makes life easier and having fun while inspiring people everywhere makes computers have a total positive effect on people. It creates a new atmosphere of enjoyment of different things. Computers effect people in the greatest way and I don't know why some people doubt its magnificent ways of indudging people in the environment.
0	The author includes that seterel paragraph because they wanted you to be able to visualize it in yor head rather than not seeing the picture. If you see a mental picture then it’s good at visualizeing.
1	The author concludes with that because she means that she will try to go a whole season without thinking about home since she failed it in winter she will try agin in spring. Oho way you can tell this is by seeing that she is talking about how the plant is reminding her how life was befor they moved to the city. For example when she smelled the plant it almost seems to take her back in time to when she was little and they were growing wild and they were pretty.
3	The story Winter Hibiscus by @CAPS1 Ho the author concludes the story with  ,”When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and hibiscus is budding ,then I will take that test again&quot;. The author does this as a symbol of hope for the reader. Also so its not just an ending where you never know what happens it gives you something to forward to. Furthermore when the geese do come back there is warm weather and the hibiscus is blommming then Saeng will be more comfortable because she has gotten use to idea of living a new place and has met more people. Meanwhile having the hibiscus in bloom will bring good memories back from when she was young and living in her homeland .This will help Saeng achieve her goal of passing her test .Also I believe  the author ended the story with that passage because it makes people want to read it again or recommend the story to someone else .I know that I hate reading stories  that just end and don’t  tell you what happens next . However the Author resolved this by letting the reader know that Saeng wants to pass the test and is going to go back and try again.
2	The last paragraph of the “Winter Hibiscus” reads “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” The author ends with this statement to let the reader know that Saeng has hope and will continue to adjust to her new settling in the @LOCATION2 @CAPS1 the story, Saeng realizes that she is not as distant from her home in Vietnam as she believes. In the florists shops she sees “plants that she had not even realized she had known but had forgotten drew her back into her childhood worth. “The plants she grew up with exist in the @LOCATION2 as well. She fails “the test” by buying a winter hibiscus after breaking down crying, homesick. By the end of the story she recognizes that she is becoming more accustomed to her new life, which is “almost familiar to her now,” such as the geese flying overhead. The statement of the last paragraph means that by the spring, she hopes to no longer be homesick, and to think of the @LOCATION2 with its geese and winter hibiscuses as her home.
3	The author ends the story that way to show Saeng's newfound determination. The whole story is about Saeng's journey one afternoon to come to acceptance with her new home, so it seems fitting to conclude with saeng's determination to pass her driving test and make life work in @LOCATION1. The story deals with several things Saeng finds that make her feel at home. “the sharp bitter melon and the hibiscus. These @CAPS1 lead Saeng to feel more at home and make it fitting to end with Saeng's acceptance that she will stay in @LOCATION1. @PERSON1 is also inspired by the hibiscus who is “strong enough to make it through the cold months that’s what matters.” This reads to Saeng's determination to make it through her new life. And finally, the geese Saeng recognizes that life in @LOCATION1 is becoming “familiar”. These geese lead @PERSON1 to the realization that this is her new home, and she can't go back. The whole story is filled with events like the three above that lead the @CAPS2 determination, so it’s fitting to conclude the story with her determination of it.   
2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it shows that a new begining is starting  For example the fact that they moved to a different country. Thats what the author means when the spring comes. Spring represents a new life which is what Saeng &amp; her mother are doing. Also the snow represents a blanked of the past / hard times. Last but not least when the hibiscus starts to bud that also means a new beganing. So if you put it all together you get the hard times going away when the snow melts &amp; then a new beginning when spring starts &amp; the flower buds  That is why the author put this paragraph in the story because they needed a fresh start.
1	They author had conclued that sentence to be the coucluding sentence because saeng thinks she deserve another chance at taking the garden test because she has failed the test before  then having her mother to be disappointed in her. And to what Saeng say at the end of the story is that she's gonna have more confidence in doing the garden test again.
0	I think the author concludes the story with the paragraph because it is the end of  winter.
3	The author probably ends the story like that because it creates a sense of hope and wonder. I feel the story is essentially about over coming things. For example, Saeng had a driving test and failed it. She also seemed a bit overwhelmed by the thought of “home”. Saeng obviously cares about failing the test or she wouldn’t have put any time into thinking about it, which led her to a green house. At the green house she was looking for a specific plant to buy, which reminded her of home. Thinking of home and her grandmother upsets her. Saeng has almost this internal war with her-self and the author ends the story that way to end the story giving the reader a sense of hope for Saeng and wonder.
1	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it shows she's not going to just give up easily after failing once. This paragraph also shows that she's trying to like this country as much as she can and she is looking forward until spring time when the hibiscus is blooming, that will remind her of home, but also of her new life in @LOCATION1.
9	Dear Local Newspaper @CAPS1, I am against that computers benefit society in anyway. Yes computers are a great way to learn about things all over the world, but people have to worry about what is right in front of them. Being on the computer all the time gives less time of exercising, no sight of enjoying nature, and gives less time of interacting with family and friends. Computers don't benefit everyone because it gives less time of exercising. When people don't exercise because they are busy always doing something else less important, then you would always be tired. You won't want to do anything but just sit around &amp; do nothing which calls for laziness you would go weak without exercise. You wouldnt have the strength to eat or lift anything which calls for your bone to go weak and you wouldn't get the calories &amp; calcium &amp; vitamins that your body needs to be strong. You would gain weight which calls for you being out of shape. Since your body has no exercise the weight &amp; fat just stays. Being on the computer doesn't help you enjoy nature the way that you are supposed to. You will never see the world for what it is. You will always miss out on fun activities, then when people start talking about how much fun they had you're going to wish you were there. And you will always be stuck in the house which is going to get boring &amp; there's nothing fun to do. If you're always on the computer cell the time you will never interact with family &amp; friends. That is mostly &amp; always more important than computers because they are always always going to be there for you. You will miss out on fun important occasions with your family because you're so addicted to the computer. And your friends will stop being with you because you're not hanging out with them. Computers really don't benefit everyday people because you miss out on the greater things of life. You will miss out on exercising, nature and especially family and friends. Then you are going to wish that you had spent time with them instead of the computer because you are going to see they had a great time &amp; you would want a great time too!
0	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because Saeng failed to get a certain plant because it died but winter is over in spring is here it’s her chance to get that flower. For example in the story it says Saeng broke down and wept. It was already dusk when Saeng reached home. It’s not her fault because in the story, it says the wind was blowing harder, tearing off the last remarks of green and chicory weeds. The concludes because it will be a next time when you see Saeng again with a beautiful plant in her hand.
1	I think that the author concludes the story with this paragraph @CAPS1 the carter Saeng want to finish or @CAPS2 Take the Test agin when they come back and and also the author is @CAPS3 people @CAPS4't give up what you are doing with your self then she say that &quot;when the snow melt and the geese return and this Hibiscus is budding Then I will take that test agin&quot; she means that she will not give up at all.
1	The author ended the story with that sentence because in the spring Saeng is going retake the test and her hibiscus will finally be budding. Saeng is going to retake the test because she failed it the @CAPS1 time she took. That is why the author put that sentence at the end of the story.
1	The author wrote this paragraph at the end of the story to symbolize a fresh start. I think this because when it is spring and the hibiscus is budding it will remind her homeland and she will take a fresh start at the test.
1	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because Saeng has vowed to retake the test in the spring and will have more confidence when the snow melts, the geese return, and the hibiscus starts budding. “A wave of loss so deep and strong that it stung Saeng’s eye now swept over her. ” Saeng feels lonely because she is from a different country and misses everything she knew and loved. Now she has the hibiscus to remind her of home.
2	The author uses this paragraph to conclude her story to show that there was thought &amp; a process gone through where she was learning &amp; growing. At first SaenG is very uneasy &amp; disappointed in herself. &quot;I-I  failed the test,&quot; saeng says. &quot;For a long moment MRS. Pan ouvong said nothing.&quot; You can tell at first the mother is disappointed &amp; then as they talk the are planting which eases the mood. &quot;How would you like an omelet w/ slices of the bitter melon? &quot; &quot;I’d love it,&quot; saeng said. Her mood has now lightened &amp; she is thaking a calm, collective decision to try again which is a reasonable decision to make when she is in a good frame of mind rather than upset &amp; distraught.
1	In the story “Winter Hibiscus” it has an unusual ending. There are many reason why the author decided to end the story this way. First, the girl failed the test which made her go into silien, when he agreed to take the test over it is a sigh of the will to suvive, and it shows that she is trying at he goal until she got it. Finnaly the ending could represent a new beging like when the snow melts away and changes winter into spring. This is what the ending of “Winter Hibiscus” means and this is why the author concluded it this way.
2	The author concludes with this sentence because it shows that Saeng is going to try to adapt to her new home. He lets you know that Saeng is not gonna grieve and be sad anymore, but she will adapt and continue on with her life. The author adds this: “I mean, not like the kind we had at-at-&quot;.This is when Saeng has just come home and talked to her mother and she is very sad because she thought about old memories at her old home, but by adding the last statement of the story it shows taht Saeng has decided to move on with life and no longer be sad. She has set a goal to accept it. This is the reason for the author to conclude this story like he does.
1	The author ended the story with that paragraph because he was trying to tell us that hibiscus represents a comfort in a time of disappointment for Saeng. She saw the plant when she just fell her driving test. 
2	Authors use conclusions to wrap up a story, or to make the reader think. In the story “Winter Hibiscus” the author uses the conclusion “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt ant the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again” he uses this conclusion to show that she is going to adapt to this culture. For example, when she is in the garden shop she breaks down crying it says “and in the warm moist shelter of the greenhouse, Saeng broke down and went” It is possible to reduce that she is crying because she uses to fit in here but because she didn’t pass her test she doesn’t think she will. So she motivates her self at the end of the story to try again. In conclusion, the author used that paragraph to show that Saeng will take the test again so she can fit into this new world.  
10	Do computers really benifit society? This has been a tricky question for years. Some people say computers are a huge help and it allows us to see the world through a different perspective; we learn more from computers and this vast increase in tecknology. Though others say computers are addicting, it is the @CAPS2 unsafe and unsecure machine to be using especially when it is left a lot of personal files on it while hooked up to the internet. Plus people spend more time on a computer than ever, missing out on thier families and friends, not being able to enjoy nature and the other simple things in life. Besides, if you want my honest opinion, computers should only be used as tools. &quot;The fact is many people look to computers as personal diaries or something to save files on or even something to play games on,&quot; says @PERSON2. &quot;They ignore the biggest fact that computers are only used to make life easier.&quot; This is really what computers are made to do, help us. It could be as simple as a @CAPS1 (@ORGANIZATION1) or as complexed as a super computer but it still only serves the main purpose of making life easier. Even if you tried to upgrade a computer it would still serve the same purpose, yet people still look on it as if it were still the next big thing in entertainment. Many people might not even know it yet but computer can turn on you and really ruin your life. Ever since @PERSON1 made @ORGANIZATION2 the @CAPS2 popular disk @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 around, people have been using computers alot. Its not because he created the fastest computer ever. It is because @ORGANIZATION2 is selling world wide; for buisnesses, small companies, schools, even in entertainment. A few years ago they made something called the xbox @NUM1. It revolutionized both gaming and the way people look at gaming. But whats the problem here? The problem is that because of @ORGANIZATION2 people are now more addicted to entertainment. When this happens people will start becoming dependent on a computer. Its not that @ORGANIZATION2 did anything bad but the fact that since @CAPS2 computers have internet, those people who depend on computers are going to find it hard to avoid being hacked or worse getting all their information stolen. There is this one thing about computers that remains constant. Family and friends will find it hard to talk to there loved one when they spend all there time on computers. This makes comunication hard, and like I said before its very addicting. &quot;@CAPS2 of the people who don't have real friends will chat with people online not knowing who they really are.&quot; says @CAPS3 @PERSON3. Making friends online is the @CAPS2 unsafe thing to do on a computer. Over @PERCENT1 of the people online are not who they say they are and people will often break away from thier real friends just to find this new &quot;friend&quot; they've made. So remember, even though computers are
1	Why the author concludes it because the author wants to show her that she won’t give up. that she will take the test again and try harder next time to overcome her challenge, and not give up. The author wants to show her, that she’s not a quitter, and she’s filled with determination even though she has conflicts.
1	Why did the author conclude the story with this paragraph? I believe that the author concluded that paragraph because it tells what she is going to do in the future. For example in the story she told her mom “I failed…” When she was putting the flower in the hole by the garden a flock of geese were flying, heading south.
2	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because she wants to try again. So when she said “Then I will take that tes again”, it means she knows she has another chance. It shows that she is strong willed and wont give up easy. So what she is saying in the last paragraph is if you don’t succed the first time try and try again. In the story it says “she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season”. In that part I can tell that she is already starting to change. So I think next time she’ll do great.
2	I think the author chose to end the story the way he did because it shows determination to pass the test. The test was to be able to make the garden graw. You know this because it says “in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.&quot; This shows that the test she look had to do with spring and the budding of flowers and that she is trying to grow something. In this story, they mention her helping her mother in the garden. So I think when the plants didn’t grow, she wanted to try again. That’s why I think they chose to end with the statement saying about taking the test again in the spring.
1	The author uses this paragraph because it brings back memories from when Saeng put down the soil during the “winter hibiscus” and a flock of Canada geese flew by her. When Saeng failed her test the first time she did not dare look at her mother. She depended on the hibiscus which helped or want to retake the test but not until they re-bud again.
0	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to conclude all the things they talked about in the story. In the story they talk about the spring time and now Saeng and her mother plants flowers and everything.
2	I think the author ends the story with this paragraph to show she won’t give up if they don’t. I think this because the birds and the hibiscus will only reapeer if they survive. That means they will stay strong in the meantime just like her. She will survive her new surrondings and change to fit into the styles of @CAPS1 life.
1	 I think the author concludes the story the way hedid is becuse it will make people wownt to read the next story to see if the test is past it add suspenes to the story
3	I think the author concludes the story with the paragraph because that represents saeng’s decision to try again and to overcome obstacles in her way. It is used instead of her saying “ I will try again next spring “ to show diction and to show her goal or decision in a different way for example, It says “, Almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season almost familiar now.” At first, geese flying in the sky was new to her, but now she’s use to it. Maybe the author is making a reference to the geese since it will be familiar (the driving test) and she will pass like she got use to and familiar with geese. Since her family came to @LOCATION1 from Vietnam, she’s been adjusting to changes in her life and to circumstances. But, Saeng seemed determined to survive and overcome it. The paragraph is saying simply that she’ll take the test again next spring, but the author put that paragraph there to show diction by emphasizing the geese, representing learning something new, and the hibiscus, something familiar. It overtones the point in the story, which is to not give up and the will to survive.

11	Dear @LOCATION2, @CAPS1's the dillemant @CAPS2 that people are supporting computer technology and others are not. I firmly believe that having computers generally has a positive effect. This is because many jobs are using them everyday and it is very efficiant for them. Also, having computers allows people to connect with other people, edit things that other technology cannot, and play fun games, @CAPS3 effect that computers have is educational websites; games, and articals. This helps many kids find a good education and adults find a comfortable and happy job. Primarily. computers have a positive effect on people because jobs are using them frequently. Jobs such as @ORGANIZATION1 and any type of police work provide sarely for people all around the united states and other parts of the world. My father always told me, &quot;Computers save people everyday&quot;. Even schools use computers! They provide educational information about the students in schools, and my school, @LOCATION1 school, uses them quite often. For example, I see my teacherm. Mr, @CAPS4 his computer every single movning in homeroom. Nearly @PERCENT1 of all jobs involve a computer by storing information or any other purposed fealuired. Would you want all those people to lose ther job because of their skills and techniques towards computer technology? I know I wouldn't, @CAPS5 keep in mind computers provide a safe and healthy life for many people. In addition, computers have a positive effect on people because they can do many things that nothing else can do. This is things like staying in town with someone far away, or editing photos. Even playing a game on the computer could ne relaxing to almost anyone. @CAPS6 is an example of keeping in town with someone else. For me, @CAPS6 is a life-saver. It allowed me to talk to my brother white he was at his chaotic college. In fact, nearly @PERCENT2 of people have an account on a computer of a public website live @CAPS7, @CAPS6, or @CAPS9. Computers keep photos saved that can be edited and even just saved to be admired. I don't want my pictures and my @CAPS6 deleted because nothing else competes with the mighty computer since it me have an enjoyable time and entertains me well. Thirdly, computers have a positive effect on people because they give aduts and kids tree access to education. I remenber my old elementery school used to play many amusing math games. These were @CAPS5 my education grew greatly dae to this game. Games as these are used frecquently thoughout the world. In addition jobs have been lost from this had economy. However, jobs we hering found more and more everyday from adults trying to find a decent job online. Computer saved people from losing their house because of the money they made with the help of computers, computers are a good idea To conclude. I imploor you that computer technology has a strong positive effect on people. Computers are like a pencil to a student. for they are very important. Jobs use them everyday, connections are made by people, and education grows because of them. That's why the technology or computers effects people in a good way.
0	The author concludes the story with this paragraph. He was talking for bout ho beautiful was nutura. He also thought sense Saeng loved nutura a lot she was going to go back to school to finish the test when she could be home in the grarden taking care of the plant. That why I think the author dicide to finish with that paragraph it would probaly discribe how much he like nature. 
3	In “Winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho, the author ended the story with that particular paragraph to symbolize new beginnings. The story is all about the failure and shame felt by Saeng when she failed her driving test, and how finding a familiar hibiscus plant gave her a new lease on life. By buying the hibiscus, Saeng was reminded of her home, and by giving that single hibiscus a new, unfamiliar place to thrive in, as she was. She was able to make a connection with the plant. The spring symbolizes the beginning of a new year, and the budding hibiscus represents the start of its new life, and so Saeng wants to restart her life when the plant restarts its life and retaking her driving test.
1	The author concludes this story with this paragraph because the symbolism of this paragraph tells that when every thing returns to normol and the “geese return and this hibiscus is budding that I will take that test again.” meaning she will be willing to move again and try to adapt.
2	The author concludes the story with the paragraph about retaking the test to show that Saeng is getting more used to @LOCATION2, our memories last forever, and even the smallest of things can hold memories for us. The paragraph shows Saeng is getting more used to @LOCATION2 by showing us that she isn’t going to give up on @LOCATION2 and that she will keep working at understanding our customs. The last paragraph also shows that our memories last forever by the hibiscus representing Vietnam and her home there. It also shows that she can start a new here just like the hibiscus does at her house. Finally the paragraph shows that even the smallest of things can hold our memories by the hibiscus representing her home in Vietnam. The hibiscus brings many memories back for Saeng and helps her cope with @LOCATION2. This is how the last paragraph shows us that Saeng is getting used to @LOCATION2, our memories last forever, and the smallest things can hold memories.
3	In the story, “Winter Hibiscus,” by @PERSON1, a teenage girl; Saeng, and her family, have moved to united states from Vietnam. Saeng is walking home after failing her driver's test, and she passes a familiar plant. She then goes into a florist shop to purchase the plant. She arrives home and tells her mother she failed the test of course her mother is upset, but she makes dinner and the plant the “winter hibiscus” at the end of the story Saeng thinks to herself, ”when they come back, in spring, when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again” I think Saeng says she will retake the test in spring because she feels confident and happy now that she is comfortable with the plant she has, and her mother isn't too mad at her. She feels that everything is going to be ok and she can retake the test in spring, when life is blooming.
2	The author concludes the story with this line because it shows that the geese was given the inspiration from the flower to come back, try again, and not give up. for example, Saeng vowed to herself that, “In the spring when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” This quote shows that the hibiscus was the reason for her determination. and that she would come back, just like they did. thats why the author decided to conclude the story with that line because she wanted to show Saeng being inspired, and not giving up.  
2	In the short story “Winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho I think the author ends with that paragraph because it shows that she is determined to pass. “When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts, and the geese return and the hibiscus budding, then I will take the test again.” This shows she is determined because geese migrate every year and flowers always bud every year. She will keep coming back just like the geese and the hibiscus do. She will be determined to pass the test and fit in sooner or later. If she was not determined she might never pass and fit into her new society.
3	I believe the author ends the story with this sentence to show how she overcome obstacles emotionally and how the hibiscus plant is a sigh of hope for future. In the beginning of the story, saeng is upset about failing her drivers test and then on top of that she gets upsets about seeing the native plants of her homeland. “In the story it says, ”When she got to the hibiscus, she reached out and touched a petal gently. And besides it was yet another friend, a small shrub” This quote shows how these plants remind her of her homeland, which she misses dearly and is very important to her. By bringing this plant back to her house, it's like she's bringing a little piece of her homeland. This quote:– “when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.&quot; shows that Saeng has hope in her life again in the form of this is a big turn of events in her life that will make her much happier in @LOCATION1 which is why she ended the story with this sentence.  
2	The author concludes the story like this because she is not ready to move on with her life. When everything turns back she will take that test and move on. But until her flowers are gone, she will not worry about school. For example she wrote “Almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now. like geese.” This means that she has been use to change and has accepted the situation.
0	I think the author concludes the Story with that statement becauses, the snow doesn’t melt in the spring geese don’t return in the winter and the hibiscus is not budding til spring either. The hibiscus is a beautiful plants Saeng loved this plant.    
6	@ORGANIZATION1, In my opinion, the effects computers have on people are good. I believe this because people can learn hand-eye coordination, they give the people the ability to learn about faraway places and people, and they even allow people to talk with people from around the world. Firstly, effects computers have on people are good because the people can learn hand eye coordination. Hand-eye coordination is good in many occations. Secondly, computers effects on people are good because computers give the people the ability to learn about faraway places and people is important becuase people can learn about history and important figures in life. Lastly, the effects people have from computers are good because computers allow people to talk with people from all around the world. This is usefull because the people can learn about each other, their customs and religious and also their cultures and heritage. All-in-all, I believe that computers have good effects on people because they can learn hand-eye coordination. Computers give people the ability to learn about faraway places and people and computers even allow people to talk with people online from all parts of the world.
3	The whole story about Saeng buying the hibiscus is in response to her failing the driving test. This crushed her. She wants to be reminded of her old homeland where she did not read to past the driving lessons. So she goes to a green house to find plants that are similar to the ones she used to have in her homeland. She does this to try to make herself feel better but still “in the warm moist shelter of the greenhouse, Saeng broke down and wept.” Saeng feels she failed and the hibiscus gives her hope and memories of her old country. Her mom clearly sees and understands this when she doesn’t yell at Saeng for spending @NUM1$ on the plant. “I’m glad you got it,” Saeng’s mom says because she knows it comforts her daughter. Together the plant the hibiscus. By doing this they are planting Saeng’s hope to grow, not only to pass the driving test but to make it in the new country. *The story ends with those lines because Saeng decides if the hibiscus will grow then so will she. She will be ready to face the driving test with hope and support and because she adapted. *The hibiscus, although it is not the one she had in the old country, she knows they can adapt to their surroundings and so the plant has in the new country. The plant will grow if it can adapt. Saeng can grow if she adapts to this new country.
2	The author is trying to communicate that Saeng will never give up and her confidence will grow so she can retake her test like the hibiscus in the spring. Comparing Saeng to the hibiscus plant in the last paragraph was to show how she will grow and advance to take the test again when it’s the right time. The snow melting represents her sorrows going away as the sun shows how she will succeed and grow like the hibiscus plant she had bought. The plant growing in the sunlight would represent her confidence to take the test next time, getting rid of the cold brisk snow which is like her negative self esteem and attitude. The author chose to compare Saeng to the plant in the last paragraph to show how it related to her life and attitude, and how her life will change in result of the hibiscus plant.
1	The author conludes her story with this paragraph because it really shows the heart and the perseveriance Saeng has. Also it tells a lot about her carter and ends the story in a strong mood. That is why she ended the story the way she did.
0	When the snow melts &amp; the geese return then mean its almost spring.
1	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because the auther felt like she would be ready for the new test. In the text it states that after walking home after failing liner driver test, she sees a familiar plant. later, she goes to a florist shop to see if the plant can be purchased That she will take the test again because she feel as thought she is confident to past it the next time around.
3	The author concludes this sentence in the conclusion because she wants to show the courage the girl has in immigrating to @LOCATION1. After having failed her drivers test Saeng was feeling deafeted and worthless. Her mother took into concideration and didn’t get mad at her for buying the flower. In fact she decided to plant the flower to show Saeng that everything would work out in the end. When Saeng began to see her mother doing this she became overwhelmed with determination and took over planting the flower for her mother. Immigrating to a new country is difficult and many immigrants face problems on a daily basis. Saeng’s mother was out in the cold planting and trying to make the best of her situation. By setting this example Saeng realized that she too could make the best out of her situation. This is why in the end Saeng decides to take her drivers test again, and ultimatly live with the same attitude her mother has.    
1	They can compair the story and this statement to eachother because in the story the does not give up and the same thing with the test who even is taking to test again did not give up cause  they are taking it again.
1	The author concludes the story with that paragraph in hope. The conclusion the author made was to say in over that amount of time, Saeng will have overcome that failure and will be more prepared for the test for a second time. In the text, it says how Saeng realized that many of the things she thought of as strange before have become almost familiar which is an improvement.
2	Minfong Ho concludes the story with this paragraph to show the change in saeng’s heart and attitude toward her new life in @LOCATION1 spring symbolize rebirth, the author doesn’t include this on accident. Spring will be saeng’s time of rebirth where she can take the test and restart her new life in @LOCATION1.”When the snow melts”is included because winter symbolizes death and when the snows melt a way so will saeng fears. 
0	Will you no in the spring the snows melt and the grass is not pretty and it’s a muddy grass for the pigs who love to now in mud how about a mud  hath ford see what winter can do to you have about the tree now weight leave to live etc good life
10	To who this @MONTH1 concern, In my opinion, computers have greatly improved our lives. Therefore I believe that owning and using a computer is for the greater good. Three reasons that support my decision are that computers have given us the ability to find information quickly and easily, they allow us to connect with people in far away places, and they help us to learn more about life and the planet we live on. Please consider my reasons when making your decision. My first reason is that computers have given us the ability to find information quickly and easily. This in turn allows us to get more done. For example lets say that your doing a report on @CAPS1 @CAPS2. You could run out to the library and look through hundreds of books and newspapers or you could just sit down at your at your computer, open up a web browser, and type a &quot;@CAPS1 @CAPS2&quot; into the search box. Within a few seconds you will have searched hundreds more libraries newspapers and even other computers to find information on your topic. You can also look for information on videos. Old newscasts, inteveiws, documeteries, you name it. It's all there right at your fingertips. My second reason is that it allows people in far away places to connect. If I said that to my mom she would probably tell me to go use the phone, but computers can do everyhing a phone can do and more. You ca share photos, videos, games, just about anything. Recently, I joined facebook and I now can talk to people I haven't seen in years who moved away I was born. Over the @DATE1 I had gone to my @CAPS3. My dad introduced me to his uncle who shared the same name as me. Then about month's later I got a friend request from a @CAPS4 who up in @LOCATION1, @LOCATION4, which is far from where I live, and now lives in. After talking to him for a while I learned that he was, the son of mydaduncle. If it weren't for my computer I would have never met him. Also,I recently learned and am getting pretty good. So one day my friends look me through a which has all it,. We began video taping a posting. So the computer has also allowed us to what without them having to be there. My third and final reason is that the computer allows us learn how to improve our lives and the planet we live on. Many people say that if you on the computer all the time you'll become fat and lazy,but that isn't always the case. I have actually been able to improve my exercise rutine byuseing the computer. Whenever I go out for a run, I can come home and find out exactly how far I ran, how many calories I burned, and anything else I want to know. I have also been able to find new more effective excersizes that allow me to target different muscles. Now lets talk about what we can learn about our planet. We can use a computer to find weather patters which allows us to plan our days accordingly. We can also use it to learn about news happening around the world. For example, the day of the earthquake in @LOCATION2, I opened up in my homepage and there it was and I was able to learn about what had happened. Finally a computer allows us to learn different cultures around the world. We can learn about how ancient egiptions lived, how the people in @LOCATION3 or @CAPS5 make money or how they construct their houses. All the things we would never know if we didn't have a computer. In conclusion, computers have improved the lives of the human race by a great deal. They have allowed us and how to improve our lives. I hope that this letter has helped you come to a decision about the effects a computer has on people lives.
1	The author chose to conclude the last paragraph with the story to show that she has not given up. It shows that she has not given up because it says “overhead...geese...honk...familiar to Saeng now (second to last paragraph).” @CAPS1 when she buys the hibiscus, because, it holds many memories from home, to keep her going. Her mother still making an “omelet with slices of bitter melon” made her math water, @CAPS1 reminding her of home, gave her hope to not give up.
0	Saeng love Flowers and plants. The Author concludes this paragraph in the stony because it go Along with the story. In the spring when the snow melts.Saeng waS waiting For winter to beover so she can see he plants and Flowers again. Saeng like the values of plants and enjoy planting them. The Author include that paragraph because he or she was showing how Saeng is so in love with plants. She couldn’t wait a new winter break was over.
2	The author ends the story with that paragraph because it shows how Saeng feels connected to the plant that reminds her of home. This connection is important because it shows how people can find ways to deal with changes in their lifes. Saeng does this by buying and planting the hibiscus plant so that she can see it and be reminded of home. She also buys the plant so that it motivates her to take the test she failed again in the spring when the flower is budding.
1	because she is confused and is not yet youst to the country she is in how so she can concentrat on her test as soon as the flower will plown because she feels more like home she thinks that she will do better on the test
1	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because the hibiscus makes her comfort, she says “when they come back in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again”. Since the author failed the test as it is told in the story, she will feel comfort taking the test again when the hibiscus come again after the snow season.   
1	The author concludes the story by saying that when the geese come back in the spring then she will try to pass the test. So say that if at first you don’t sucede, try try again. Also the author concludes with that to show that Saeng has been in the @LOCATION2 for some years and that she still misses her home back in Vietnam.
1	She thinks she is gonna pass the test because on spring becaus everything gets back on live againg flowers start growing again trees start to get green every thing starts to get Green the Geese are returning animals are starting to come out people go to the beach to distract their selve and that might be what she wan’t’s to do.
2	The author most likely concludes this story with the quote because she has renewed hope. She was feeling really upset because she had failed the driving test and when she saw the hibiscus flower, she got even more emotional because she misses her home but when she sees the geese as she finishes planting the flower, she decides she’s going to try to retake the test next spring.
3	The author concludes the story with, “in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,” to show Saeng growing up. As another year passes, Saeng will be more comfortable with her circumstances, and ready to start over fresh, just like all the plants will be blooming and budding. Failing her drivers test, really upset Saeng, so by waiting another year, she will be able to practice more, and become better, so that when she goes back and retests, she will be an even better driver, by having the time to practice, and start over. It’s almost like a new beginning for Saeng, another year has past, and new when her familiar plant budds, and begins to start over, so will she. Since the hibiscus plant is familiar to Saeng, she is better able to relate to it, and as it buds, and start fresh, so will Saeng. In conclusion, this is why the author concluded the story with that phrase.
1	I think the author includes this paragraph  in  the  story  because  it  makes  sence  the  geese  come  back  home  after  the  snow  melts  and  saeng  try’s  to  take  her  test  again  around  that  time.
11	Dear @LOCATION1, I understand this focus situation, the effect of computers or our society people's reactions are less than about them &amp; my question to is who? Computers a very good effect on our town's specify. Computers areaids in tracking hand-eye coordination. They give people the opportunity to look at things &amp; talk to that it traveled here they wallets empty faster than the speed of it. @CAPS2 also have the ability to help people so things that an than a pig sty. Let me explain more these reasons. Computers are very good for our society because they are kids in tracking hand-eye coordination to kids &amp; adults. Just to help you understand why in to teach hand-eye coordination, @CAPS2 are so many that help you learn but help you learn will get you. In foot ball catching helps to teach the skill but makes you up on the ground after being by someone potentially yourself. In baseball swinging at a pitch to teach his skill, but if the is very close to you it could how you for the if you do the ball could someone &amp; hurt them, ability to day back. Computers are great way to this skill in a saw Even @CAPS1 @PERSON1 here in town says that he has seen an of kids with better hand eye coordination, due to do have a good our town? Well, computers let people to that. You can talk to relatives in far away places but to travel with this. I'm sure that you're wondering if I have I do have another reason. Computers have to samethings electronically so fast easily, make a look on computer's hard drives, @CAPS2 are so much more that ran be on a computer, that make a room empty. Before my famiy had a computer complete dedicated to papers files that your so important &amp; that we could not lose. When up got picture, typed up paper, saved our was empty! I hope that this letter has proves to you computers effect on our society. Computers help and in the process of hand eye coordination. The help to thing happen but if done on real life could faster of they also help to electronically than a. So now, after this letter you go out i publish this telling every good effects of computers. Again I thank you for reading this letter.
3	In the story “Winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho, author ends the story with “When they come back, in the spring when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,” to show that Saeng is ready to adapt, but still needs time. Throughout the story, Saeng struggles with overcoming moving from her home, to an unfamiliar place hundreds of miles away. However, Saeng still isn’t ready to let go of her home yet. So she tries to hang on to her old memories, only to that in @LOCATION1, everything is different. When she buys a familiar plant to her, she realizes that even it is different in @LOCATION1, and gets angry that nit isn’t what she expected. However, at the end of the story she realizes that different isn’t always so bad, and vows to try to accept this new culture, but nows that it will still take a long time before she is ready to fully do so.
1	The author concludes the story with that ending paragraph like that because when the spring comes back she going to try again. When I was reading this story it’s says in the story that her mother had asked her “What happened.” And the Saeng said “I- I failed the test”. So I am predicting that her mother is going to help her more with her studying and with her gardening. When the snow melts and Saeng vowed to herself that this time she work harder and past the test.
1	Why the author concludes the story with this paragraph is because that is when she will take the test again. Also because the geese made her realize, that many of the things that she had thought were strange before had become familiar. Just like the geese. It was through the quiet repitition of season upon season.
2	She ends with that paragraph because it starts over. When the geese came back and the hibiscus is budding its like restart and she can try again, dealing with her memories of home and her adaption to the new country. I think she will be able deal with it better and take it again, it shows that she wont give up.
1	She says that because she had failed to keep the tropical plant a live.She was disappointed in herself and so  that  why  she  said. In  the  spring, when  the  snow  melt  and  the  geese  return  and  this hibiscus is budding, then  I  will take  that  tes t again. When  she  failed  and her mother said it will be okay you can always try again.
1	I believe that why the author concludes the story with this paragraph is because she is telling the reader and herself In my point of view that once again she do work in the garden to see if it catches her interest. I believe that the author is trying to express this because in the beggining of the story the author shows no interest in the garden or any interest of the world around her. For example when she was supposed to buy just seeds for the garden she went and used some of her mother’s money to buy herself a big mac. So In conclusion I believe that what I wrote clearly states how the author feels and why she ended they story the way she did.
1	The author concludes the story with “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the show melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.&quot; because Saeng failed the test before and now she wants to pass the test. She learned a lot from her mother that day that completely changed her attitude towards life.
1	The author might of concluded the story with that sentence to show that she still cares about the test and not mostly about a meisly plant thats gonna die anyways. Also because she needs to pass the test and the author is putting in a getall that in the end the girl is gonna pass and not have to re-take that test all over again. but also he/she tells that because he/she wants us to know that it aint all about other things that are expensive in life but that school is really more important than anything basically.
2	The reason why the author, Minfong Ho, finished the story “Winter Hibiscus” on with the last paragraph  was due to in the story the girl went out on a test. And on this test which I do not know what the test is, she failed it and returns with a saebba hedge. This is a tamed plant for the family. The family loves this plant. They are what I understand from the story, newcomers to a country. And the country is @LOCATION1. They’ve moved here from Vietnam. She goes for her driving test and comes home failed. One of the things her mother asks, “why do you spend so much money on this beautiful plant when you could a had the famed bee-maags” which is the mother’s attempt to say a Big Mac which is their favorite fast food sandwich. But the reason why the daughter comes back with the plant is she has failed her parents on the driving test. She wants to go back and try again. “Then the snow will melt and geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will return to take the test again.” She believes the next time she goes, she will pass the test and that she will not be ashamed of it and that she will make her parents proud by passing the test due to it is a high honor to the family, I believe, from what I am getting from this. In Vietnam not many people drive and that they want their daughter to earn this and it is something they do not have.
3	It is clear that Saeng is in the midst of struggle during a time of homesickness after recently moving from Vietnam. But as time goes on she will learn to balance the affection she feels for both her new country and homeland. As Saeng moves through the story it is apparent that she longs for memories of her homeland, but is beginning to find new things to enjoy about her new home. For example, while she is touched by the memories aroused by the hibiscus flower, she is intrigued by the new experiences, such as eating Big @CAPS1 and new friends. While homesickness has caused her to struggle she knows that with time she will be able to overcome the obstacle of leaving the old ways, for the new without completely obliterating either. She is convinced that by spring she will be able to overcome this obstacle and have the confidence to pursue any that will arise in her future.    
11	Dear local Newspaper; @CAPS1 you know that computers teach you to do many things? You probably do! I understand you would like to know my opinion on whether or not computers have a positive or negative effect on people. Well, I think that it has a positive effect. Computers teach you how to type and learn the moun keys. It also helps you to look things up like people, states, and etc. Lastly, it helps you to interact with other students when not in school. i encourage you to continue reading to hear my wonderful and strategic ideas. First of all, I think that computers have a positive effect on people because it gives you the learning skills to learn how to type I remember last year in @NUM1 grade, the tech ed teacher, ma @LOCATION4, told to go on a website that was all about learning how to type. It told us that the main keys were. A,@CAPS2,@CAPS3,@CAPS4 and @CAPS5,@CAPS6,@CAPS7, and colon(;). It was very helpful. From then on I typed like that. I think that learning how to type is an excellent thing. Typing helps you if you want to become a secretary or even a newspaper editor. My mother is a secretary down town at the low form called: @ORGANIZATION1. She works for three houses so she learned to type really fast. Typing is a big part of your life. You can use it for a project that you have to do for class, or an essay lthat you have to type to apply for a scholarship ro colege. Typing is used everywhere, even in math class my teacher types up things and pits them on the @CAPS8 @CAPS9. In addition, computers have a positive affect on people because they help look up famous people, states, countries, and etc. I remember on @NUM2 grade I @CAPS1 a project on @CAPS10, and in @NUM3 grade I @CAPS1 a powerpoint on I've also done a project on @LOCATION1 in @NUM1 grade, I @CAPS1 one on @PERSON1 this year for music, and I'm beginning one on @LOCATION2 and @LOCATION3. As you can tell, I've been using a computer, basically my whole life, except when I was a baby, but now that I think about it, when @CAPS11 a baby I got a little fake computer. i know computers are @LOCATION1 but they do have a positive effect on people. When was the last time you need a computer to help you look up something or someone? Priority not too long ago. Computers are the real dael. They can help you do anything. They've helped me my whole life. To be continued, computers have a positive effect on people. They help interact with other people students, and fa mily members, when not in contact. I remember when my cousin moved away. i was so sad. I didn't went her to leave. So then she gave me her email to contact her on the computer so I could talk to her. The computer has many websites where people can interact like: @CAPS12, @CAPS14, @CAPS13, aol, msn, yahoo, g-mail, twitter, and many more. i like talking to people from all over the country. I talk to my friend when I'm at home. i talk to family members. My favorite website is @CAPS14. I am a fanatic of it. It'@CAPS2 spo much fun. Do you have a favorite interaction website? @CAPS1 you have any interaction websites? If you don't you should get one. This is why computers have a positive effect on people. In conclusion, i think that computers have a positive effect on people. One because they can interact with others. Two: they can look up things to help them. Three, they can develop a sense of typing. Thank you for reading my letter which I 'm sure has persuaded you to agree with me on how computers have a positive effect on people.
8	Dear @CAPS1 Newspaper, @CAPS2 you know what computers are doing to the people of the @LOCATION1? Well I @CAPS2. People are on the @NUM1. We need to @CAPS2 something about these computers. They are preventing people from exercising, going outside, are are just making them stay in there house all day. One reason I think we should get rid of computers is because people aren't getting there exercise. the computer, next to the @LOCATION2, is probably the number one thing that makes people fat. Kids are sometimes on the computer all day eating snacks and junkfood when they should be eating healthy fruits and vegetables. You could. Almost @CAPS2 anything on the computer that you @CAPS2 in your everyday life, that's how good technology is. The computer is the thing that gets people addicted to something. The computer has games, internet, and ways to talk to people that get then attached. A second reason is that computers just keep taking money out of your pocket. When you buy a computer most people just buy the most expensive one, because the salesman talks then into it. Most people don't know what kind of computer they are supposed to buy, so they buy the most expensive one because they think the more, the better. Also just buying the computer isn't all of it. When you download softwares, games, and moble things that all cost money. Downloading one thing can cost up to one hundred dollors. plus, most people can't afford these downloads after buying themselves a pricy computer. My third opinion is that the computer is just a complete waist of time. People spand hours on the computer doing stupid stuff, like playing games and talking to the, when they should all be outside enjoying the fresh air. Going outside is very important to your health. Next time your on the computer doing something that doesn't need to be done, go outside. Think about it, hour often @CAPS2 you go outside? My guess, not much. Now @CAPS2 you know what computers are doing to the people of the @LOCATION1? They are making people fat, not getting there exercise, eating junk food and play games all day long on this stupid piece of technology. Instead of being on the computer all day why don't you think about going air you need. Also you don't want to be waisting all of your hardworked money on a stupid piece of technology. Plus, you don't want to deal with softwares and there viruses. My advice, computers are terrible.
1	The author concludes the story with Saeng vowel to show a sense of change in Saeng. The winter time is very brutal like Saeng’s mum said but spring is when things come alive. I think is showing the sense in Saeng. Though winter is tough and you @MONTH1 get them trown around by the wind. When spring comes she will try the test again and come to life and enjoy the @LOCATION1 even thagh that she is far from rain. The author did the right thing to conclude the story with that vowel. 
1	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because he is trying to say whenever something leaves their home they always come back. The hibiscus reminds her of home and that is where she wants to go. Saeng had failed her drivers test and she said when the geese come back I will do it again. The plant reminds her of home but its, “Not like the tird we had before” (Ho). She is trying to say that the ones over at Vietnam are better and she wants to go back because she misses it.
0	Saeng is talking about flowers coming back in the spring time. She is vowing to take the test again after the snow is gone and she is going to do it agin. “The wind was blowing harder, tearing of the last remnants of green in the chicory weeds that were growing.&quot; So she cant wait until it is spring agin. So she can try to plant agin.
0	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it is saying when everything comes beet to the way they were she will do everything agein so thins aren’t the same as they used to be and she wants them to.
2	The girl, Saeng , seems to be attached to nature and enjoy it when the spring comes like she said, a new natural intenill start and she will be motivated to take the test that she failed again. The author most likely finished with this paragraph to show that there will be hope for Saeng and she will do what she has to do to have comfortably in her new home country. The whole story talks about how she is still unsatisfied with her new home but it would be cut to and the stay with new chances and a new life, which they did using springtime to show this.
1	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show maybe by this time she will be comfortable with her new home. I know this because when I moved i didn’t like it because I didn’t have many friend but in like a year or two I was fine because I had a lot of friend. This is like Saeng because she misses her old home because she keeps talking about it then crying for example, when see saw the plant it was the one she had at her old home and she started crying because she missed it. In conclusion that is why he put that at the end of the story.
1	In the story “winter Hibiscus,” the author included important part at the end that saeng vowed. The reason why she said that is because when everything in her life starts up again she will love her life again, she will be alot happier person.
0	The author in @LOCATION1 this because it is shows what is is going to do to he her gain failed and this story a what she must do get just from the geese
2	I believe that the author chose to end with that paragraph because the paragraph represents new beginnings and starting over. When Saeng fails her driving test she has a moment of weakness, she feels lonely and then she sees a plant that reminds her of her home in Vietnam. In a since, the plant comforts her. “it’s flowers aren’t as pretty, but it’s strong enough to make it through the cold months here” In this quote Saeng’s mother tells her that the flower is too, out of place but yet has found the courage and determination to still grow. In the closing paragraph Saeng decides that, like the flower and the birds, she can also find the coarge to face fears. She deciedes to retake the tests.
1	In the story “Winter Hibiscus” The Author concludes with this paragraph to show that she’s not going to give up and to show her mom that too.
8	I believe that computers benefit society and help people understand things more clearly. Computers help people study, learn, and even talk to other people. Here are some good reasons on why computers help people out with problems. First of all, computers give you information on things that you cannot find in books. People can look up places for vacations, what their child's grade in school is, and find healthy food recipies. Without the computers people would be lost not knowing what to do. Next, computers let you talk to friends. You can discuss things like weather, ideas you have, you can even plan exercise days. What if something important happens? The person does not have his or hers phone. What could they do? They could go on the computer and tell their friend. It would be a lot easier than driving over to the persons house then driving driving all the way back. Finally, computers can give you a good sense of hand eye cordination. Computers can teach you how to type without even looking at the keyboard. This skill could be used to pursue a good career in the carpentry field. Computers can also help you study for a new job and what the requirements are. In conclusion, I believe that computers make peoples a little bit easier knowing that they have vital information right at the tips of their fingers. It can also help them in anything they want to do. Like talk to friends, look up info and teach skills.
1	I belive the author was saying a new start. I say this because of everything coming back. I also say it because Saeng knows whats important now and will take it seriously. That is what I think the author was saying at the end of the story.
2	During  “Winter  Hibiscus”  written  by  Minfong  Ho, a young  girl  and  her  mother   to  a new place,and the  daughter  Saeng  is  having a hard time.Saeng found a plant called dok faeng-noi that reminds her of home. So  she bought it and took it home to show her mom, At first her mother was upset, she bought a @NUM1 dollar plant but then hearing her daughter is disappointment in herself, she found joy in the beautiful plant, while Saeng’s mother was cooking dinner .Saeng planted the beautiful plant and told herself when the  geese return, hibiscus is budding and its spring she will retake the test. She found strength in herself and  courage  to  do  better.  I think the author wanted to show how she gained respect for herself in the end of the passage. That is why the author ended it like she did.   
2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it is what the whole story is about. It is about how Saeng misses home and filed the test when she bought the hibiscus. Saeng failed the test because she bought the hibiscus. She let herself by the flower and remember her home. That make her sad. In that last paragraph she is saying when the geese come back in the spring, she will be used to the new country and home, and will not fail the test. If she is tempted by something from home, she will not take it because it will make her sad. The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it is the main idea of the story. It shows her getting used to the new home
1	In the story “Winter Hibiscus,” written by Minfong Ho, the author concludes the story with that paragraph to sum it at all up. The author used this to keep the reader wondering too.
1	The author concludes the story with, “when they come back, saeng vowed Silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again”, to show that even though she failed her test she isn’t giving up and that she will persevere over this and continue to try. This ending shows the determination in Saeng’s heart. Saeng has enough determination inside of her to go on even though she failed her test and failed her grandmother to continue trying and continue to try to complete for her grandmother and herself. I really liked this ending and I am glad that the author decided to use this ending in the story.
2	Having failed the drivers test really upset Saeng. Not only that but she had to moved to a new country and the loss of her grandmother really made thing worse. The Hibiscus plant in this story, is like a symbol. It represents her life and reminds her of one in Vietnam. The way memorys come to her as she sees these flowers shows how she felt. It was all about starting new and overcoming obstacles. When she says, “… and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,” it shows her starting new again and making it through the rough times, symbolized by winter. It was a symbol of herself and the hardship she will overcome. 
1	In the story the author concludes the story in his last paragraph because he showes that even in her hardships. Saeng goes on and keeps trying to live a normal life after she had to move. For example when it says, “Saeng vowed silently to herself in the spring I will take the test again.” This shows that even after one failuare you should never give up but don`t forget the past.
3	The author of the story “winter Hibiscus”, Minfong Ho, concludes the story with a meaningful paragraph. The author wrote, “When they come back…in the spring… then I will take that test again”.(No). Saeng thought to herself and meant that she would move on in the spring. It also shows that Saeng could overcome failing the test. The narrative also states,”…in the spring…when…this hibiscus is budding…”(No). The season of spring means to symbolically start new and fresh. When the flower is budding, it is beginning a new life. Saeng is also starting fresh when she decides that she will take the test in the spring. Finally, this shows that Saeng could adopt to her new life by purchasing a familiar plant. The hibiscus helped her get through disappointing times. The geese also were a reminder that some things back home were the same. Minfong Ho concluded the story with this paragraph to emphasize Saeng's adaptations. 
1	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because she wants to tell people that shes going to take the test again and try. Shes going to be like the flowers but she needs time so when they budd she will.
2	In the story “winter hibiscus “by @CAPS1 Ho the storey ends with Saeng promising herself that she will take the test again in the spring. The author most likely ends this way because it shows how Saeng is getting over her sorrow test in the spring when the Hibiscus is in @LOCATION1. This is shown when Saeng says “I-I failed the test (@NUM1) this shows @CAPS2 leaving her homeland and makes her even more so sad, but she then promises herself that in the spring when flowers @LOCATION1 she will try again. She does this when she says to herself “…in the spring when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.”(pg @NUM2) this shows her getting over her sorrow and becoming determined and looking forward and taking the test again.
8	To whom it @MONTH1 concern, @CAPS1 more people are getting involved with using the computer while I think that is great other don't. I believe that using a computer is a good thing because technology is going to progress and computers will be the base, also computers are safer now because or privacy options and virus block. Finally, computers help you gather knowledge that no one book could tell you. Although technology is progressing computers are only the basics. Sooner or later everything will be based on computers like, jobs, school, and ever the medical field. Jobs will have more computers and touch screen devises because they are easier and more technologicly advanced. As for school @CAPS1 students have to take computer classes to learn how to write brouchures and make websites. The medical field is now using more advanced ultrasounds that take the image and make it there dementional. So, if everything is changing around you why do you want to be stick in the past? Although, some people are worried about internet saftey and viruses, there are ways that those can be limited. As for social networking sites don't set it up for the whole world to see. Set it up for only your friends to see. Also, make sure you know who your friends are. As for viruses, don't go on websites that cause viruses. Also, you can get a virus blocker that helps eliminate them. The computer also helps to give you and get you knowledge. You can learn about cocrent civilizations. Or modern day without taking a step out of your house. Also the internet has vertual simulations so you can experence what it was like in other coultures, in other time pericals. Computers give you knowledge that help you through your life especially if you don't have a library. Even though some people disagree computers are the base of technology, safe, and full of knowledge I do. Yes, they do have some flaws but they are a great learning tool.
3	The author concludes the story with “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts when the geese return and this hibiscus budding, then I will take that test again”. The author does this to show how Saeng was able to slowly adjust to change while not forgetting where she came from. This is shown by using symbols of geese and hibiscus together. The geese represent the new home and sounds Saeng had to become adjusted to. While the hibiscus represents the old memories of her past and homeland. Putting the symbols together shows she has come to accept both places. By @CAPS1 that she’ll take the test again in the spring shows how she will be ready for the change because the test represents how she feels abut @LOCATION1 and by passing the test she allows herself to pass with @LOCATION1 and adjust to the change in her life.
1	They used this sentence because she wants to see the flower bud and feels like she is at home again. Then she will take the test. She also will feel lucky and have a memory of home so saeng vowed silently to herself.
2	 The author concludes the story with the sentence, ’’when they come back  Saeng  vowed silently to her self in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again’’. The story tells us most of the hard times and obstictes  Saeng has had to go through. The two major ones in this story were moving to a new placThe author concludes the story with the sentence, ’’When they come back Saeng vowed silently to her self in the spring,when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding,then I will take that test again.The story tells us most of the hard times and obstictes Saeng has had to go through.The two major ones in this story were moving to a new place,and failing her ariving test.Saeng had a hard time trying to overcome these events and others.So I think this  sentence was put at the end so the readers could see that see was going to be ok, and overcome everything that happened.Know we know this special plant will help Saeng will future proplems.       e, and failing her ariving test. Saeng had a hard time trying to overcome these events and others. so I think this sentence was put at the end so the readers could see that see was going  to be ok, and overcome everything that happened know we know this special plant will help Saeng will future problems.     
2	After reading the about story, “Winter Hibiscus “ by Minfong Ho, I believe the quote, “when they come back, Saeng  vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and the hibiscus the budding, then  I will take that test again.” Was put in the story for a reason. I believe that this quote concluded the story because it ashamed a tone and feeling of hope. For example, in the story it state that “Saeng day out a hole and carefully lowered the plant into it”. This shows that this plant areas a lot to here. The story tell the readon that it things lack memories of her grandmother. It represents hope to Saeng because it always brings back happy memories she once had which push here to try to overcome the loss betters. Therefore, the quote concludes the story because it about Saeng will for hope and peace. It represent that when the plant blooms in the spring she will have a new found sense of hope and happiness.
2	“Winter Hibiscus”, by Minfong Ho is a story about transition to @LOCATION1 and her own ability to be strong. Saeng failed her drivers test and was dissapointed as she walked home. She stops at a florist shop because she see's a plant that she thinks is like the one she had back home. Seeing this plant again makes her remember memories from her homeland. She plants it when she gets home and vows to take a driving test again. When the geese get back. The plant is like encouragment to her.
1	The author concludes the story with the paragraph because the story was about her getting accustomed to things being repeated in nature, so she added the last paragraph saying that when everything happens again she will do the same. That is why the author concludes the story with the paragraph.
0	I think the athor includes that becaus. she mite have faeled and need more time to study to get thing @NUM1 so other than that damn new
2	The author uses this sentence to conclude the story to show that Saeng’s hope is restored. Throughout the story Saeng is sad and misses her home. She feels hopeless in this new land, the hibiscus reminds her of home and brings back memories of her being at home with her grandmother, which makes her want to be back at home. The author adds the part about the geese leaving because they also have to leave their home. The hibiscus is to symbolize her being strong and that she will make it through moving to just strange land.
2	I believe the author concludes the story with this paragraph to show Saeng won’t give up &amp; will keep trying. In the story all the memories of her old country encouraged her to be strong. For example the flower made her sad but in the end it made her better. Also in the beginning she didn’t really like new changes and she missed home, but at the end some of the same memories she had back home were in her new country. Those are the reasons I believe the author concludes the story with that paragraph
2	In the story “winter hibiscus” by Minfong Ho I believe that the author ended the story with that paragraph because it shows that if the Hibiscus plant has enough strength to come back and flourish than she has enough strength to come back and take the test again. For example, in the story it says “but its strong enough to make it through the cold months.” This quote shows that the hibiscus plant is strong. And Saeng sees that as if the plant is strong enough to return after a cold winter than she can return to the test after failing. Overall, I think that both Saeng and the hibiscus plants are very strong.
6	Dear @PERSON1, Experts are concerned about the use of computers. They say that they spend hours on the computer and less time exercising enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends. I agree. While people use the computers, they don’t interact and meet new friends in person. They stay inside and don't get excersise, and kids might talk with strangers. When we use computers we chat with friends online and don't really interact with others. We meet new friends and chat online and never meet them and socialize, so that is one disadvantage of a computer. Another problem is lack of exercise. While we are on the computer we spend a lot of time and sometimes causes us to even forget to exercise. Then we slowly begin to get unhealthy. Another major problem of computers is talking or chatting with strangers. Some might meet some random people online and give them personal info. Kids might even meet with some of the strangers they talked to online and get hurt! well thank you for reading my opinions about computers. I hope you take them into consideration. Kids and even adults dont interact with freinds, lack exercise, and give personal information to strangers.
2	In this story it is about how Saeng and the hibiscus plant are similar when it comes to adapting to their surrounding and how her and the plant will keep continuing just like Saeng with her “test”. But I know this because its says “Then I will take that test again” her saying that is her saying she will thrive again just like the hibiscus plant. So in conclusion she really is much like the plant and will continue for many seasons to come and also adapt to the changes just like the hibiscus. 
1	The author ended the story with the last paragraph because spring time comes and geese return, shell feel better about herself so she can go and take the test again and focus more on the test .
1	In the story “winter Hibiscus“ by @CAPS1 Ho, the author concludes the story with that paragraph because it goes along with the story. In the story Saeng went to look for the pant that reminded her of her grandma. She found the plant and then she thought of her grandma and she cried. I think she was testing herself to see if she had gone on with her life but she failed. So I think she bought the plant so she can try again when the plant is in bloom.
1	He want to learn hibiscus spirits. Don't be afraid of fare. You just keep ahead, continuly to learn what you want, then you will success. like hibiscus has strong alive: fight with evironment. So, the author use this paragraph to conclude, the purpose is the Saeng will take this test again, like hibiscus will budding when spring's come
0	When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, the hibiscus is budding. she will take the test. I think that the author conclude the story with this paragraph because she wants to test them again.
1	The author ended that story like that because that’s  how she started the story.The little girl was looking at the flowers and plants in the the beginning ,so the author thought that it would be a good thing to end the story like it was started.Also because the friendship that Saeng has with the plants and flowers will come back again in the spring when everything is blooming and looking very beautiful.It shows that the plants give a sense of comfort when she is going through hard times.That is why the author concludes with Saeng and the plants.
2	In @CAPS1 Ho’s “Winter Hibiscus,” the author concludes the story with a meaningful paragraph. The author tries to make a message to saeng. When saeng saw the geese “slowly fading into the distance” she thought of herself. “When they come back&quot; Saeng will also come back to school. “the geese return and this hibiscus is budding” means that saeng will return to the school and be a new person. “This hibiscus is budding” states that saeng is still growing, just like the hibiscus. She will then take that test again” because it’s a new start for her and a new beginning. Spring is an archetype of rebirth and a new life. since the flowers will be growing and having a new life, so will saeng.
2	Saeng vowed to herself that when the hibiscus begins to bud again she will take the test again. The hibiscus symbolizes hope to saeng that things can work out a second try. She concludes the story with the vow because, it expresses her last bit of hope. For example, the hibiscus has comforted her in a new country, with new surroundings but it also explains how she feels. She vows to show she won't give up despite of falling the first time. For example, “Saeng felt a shock of recognition so intense , it was almost visceral ”(Ho). This quote explains what the plant meant to her. This is why she concluded the story with a vow.  
2	 The author ends the story with this paragraph to show Saeng’s resolution. Her family had left a lot behind in Vietnam. She had the memory of her grandmother and hibiscus. edge. In the @LOCATION2 they are struggling as implied by the mothers reaction at the cost. The hibiscus she bought was away to comfort her. She thinks that if the plant can put up with the harsh winter environment she can do despite the differences in the @LOCATION2 and passing the drivers exam is something that many do and is a way to get used to her surroundings / fit in.
2	The author concludes the story with this sentence because it shows the girl the is willing to overcome obstacles and although she @MONTH1 have failed once she will keep trying, It also shows a connection between the geese and the hibiscus and the girl wanting to overcome her obstacles. Also the girl wants to overcome her obstacle at a certain time.
8	Dear Newspaper, Some people are asking others about the effects computers have on other people. Some experts are concerned that people are spending too much time on their computer and less time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends. But my opinion is that the comuter is great and it does not keep people away from other activitys. First, the computer does not keep people away from other activitys because, there are @NUM1 hours in a day, and it's that persons folt if they don't get off the computer, and go do other activitys. Even though the computer has lots of things, and it is very interesting. people. Should still have the common since to get off nad go do other things, so I think it's there fult if they don't get off the computer. Also there are a lot of reasns that people don't get out and do other activitys, so why just stop computers. Secondly, the computer does not keep people away from other activitys, because there are lots of destration that keep people away from other activitys, so why blame computers. For example the television keeps people from doing other activitys, but their not talking about stop that. Also the computer teaches you about a lot of thngs, an can so you a lot of things that you don't know about and is trying to find out. For example your family's history, you could go look that up on the computer. Lastly, the computer does not keep people away from other activitys, because if people were really worried about there other activitys then they would get off the computer and go do what they had to do. For example if they had to go to the gym then they should get off the computer, and go to the gym because the computer does not make you fat, you make yourself fat, so the should be resonable enough to go to the gym, and not be on the computer all day. Also if you were going to spend time with your family the how could the computer stop you from doing that, you should already know what you need to do and I don't think the computer would make you forget things like that. So it would be the person's fult if they forget not the computers. To rap this up, computers does not keep people away from other activitys, because it's there responablity to remeber what they need to do not the computers and there are lots more destrations then computers, but it's still not computer's falty it your's.
1	In the last paragraph when she siad she was going to have the test again, but in the spring when all the snow melts and the hibiscus budd's. She says that because, that is her favorit time of the year. So she will feel more confident that time. For example when she talks about the manigascar hibiscus that grows through bricks she loves hibiscuses. So she wants to take the test when she feels the best. 
1	I believe the author concluded the story with that paragraph to let readers known that Saeng is a survivor just like hibiscus. Saeng has not quite adapted to america and feels that this plant reminds her of home
1	The author finishes it with this because spring time is a new beginning. Since Saeng failed the test she wants to start over in the spring like the flowers do. To know that the hibiscus will grow back though now it is dying. For spring to come is a time to start a new, where babies are born, flowers are at blom and a new beggening is forming
2	The concludes the sentence this way because their trying to show that Saeng is a very deterimined girl and no matter how many times she fails, she always trys again and again tell she gets it right. By doing this the author is showing what Saeng believes in and that is no matter how big or hard the chanellge is she will keep on going tell she is done what she started. Because moving was a very hard for her. She had a very hard time communicating with peolpe and just tyring to make friends cause it is not always easy be new, by moving she took a another look at things because they were different on her. But as time went by she got the hang of it so as long as you try you can be successful in it that’s what the author was trying to say by concluding it the way it was.
1	In the story a young girl named saeng takes a test but she had falled. She is going to retake it next spring, thats why the last paragraph say; when then come Back, Saeng vowed  silently to herself, in the spring mum the snow melts and geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then l will take the test again the author concludes the story with this ending @CAPS1 in the story it talks about the hibiscus flowers so, since she failed the test instand  of saying she will retake it next spring they say when the hibiscus flowers bud @CAPS1 at that time it will be spring.
1	The author concludes the story like that to let the readers know that the daughter saeng would come back and take the test again, she loves the Garden sotherefore she will not forget what spring did for her.
0	It shows that she loves her plants. The story tells you all of the plants and how she likes them. She thinks they are all unique and that she enjoys the plants more than school or anything else.
3	Minfong who concludes &quot; Winter Hibiscus&quot; with this paragraph because it show @CAPS1's determination to succed in her new country despite the obstacles she faces. The winter hibiscus reminds Saeng to be strong like the hibiscus in is to endure winter or in Saeng's case to pass the driving test the text states &quot;....but it's strong enough to make it through the cold months here, this winter hibiscus ....&quot;(Ho @NUM1). Saeng realizes she must also be &quot;strong&quot; lkie the &quot;winter hibiscus&quot; Saeng also realizes that she is beginning to adopt to the new country he wrote &quot;Almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things she had though strange before had become almost familiar...&quot;(Ho @NUM1).Saeng knows that she is able to adopt and is determined to succeed. Tthe author conclude.&quot;..in the spring, the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again&quot; (Ho @NUM1) The &quot;spring &quot; will be Saeng's
2	In the story, @ORGANIZATION1, by Minfong Ho the aurthe concluldes the story with the last paragraph because he's trying to say when the flower comes back to life and starts a new beginning that Saeng will start a new beginning by retaking the test. For example, “Look how root - bound it is, poor thing&quot;. The example is saying how the plant was almost died when she bought it. Another example would be, &quot;I-I failed the test&quot;. The example tells how she feels down about failing the test. So In @CAPS1 the flower was at it's “breaking point&quot; as well as saeng. The paragraph tells how @CAPS2 was going to take a break and wait for the flower to being stronger till she toke the test again.
2	The author added the last paragraph because Saeng’s vow helps the reader Saeng and her pain, but her optimism that things will get better. I translate the vow into when things start to be normal again it will get much better for her in this new country. The spring symbolizes normal because at home where she thinks is normal is covered with beautiful flowers, like spring. The snow melting would be the pain going away. The geese returning would symbolize that saeng knows things will get better like she knows the geese will be back in the spring. The hibiscus in the story has symbolized her home and her grandmother, which symbolize happiness, so she will be happier when things get better.
7	To whom it @MONTH1 concern, I was sitting at home when I have realized this has to come to an end! The computer bissness has taken my mother and my stepfather away from me, I mean when they are on facebook they are in a whole nother galaxcey. The family spends no time together what so ever. Also, they argue, dont sleep and again, we don't spend anytime together! Not spending time with family isn't a good thing. Social activity is good for everyone. Even if the time spending is not with family, socializum is a very important rollplay in use. On the other hand arguing isn't. Arguing just decreases the social time spent. Arguing in my family causes friction to the point where we become unsocial and turn to a computer. Now if were arguing about the computer then we have a huge problem. The arguing will never end! Not sleeping is my biggest concern though, when they are up all nite on that stupid thing, oh gosh don't get me started. I believe they don't have good days during the day when in school. Actually I know they don't because they are day. Computers cause my parents to use up family time, fight, and not sleep, they spend more time on the personal computer than I'm a! @CITY1 @PERSON1, I think we have a problem. A very big one!
1	The author concludes the story with this sentence because the girl saeng wanted to take the test again, but also wanted her habiscus to stay strong and to keep growing. So she said I will take the test again when my habiscus starts to bloom again.
2	Winter Hibiscus by @CAPS1 Ho explores one's quest for acceptance and adaptation to changes in life. Saeng is  the young in the story who is dealing with her recent move to america from her homeland in asia. after failing a test, Saeng spends an dosene amount of money on a flower. When she consoltes with her mother, Saeng silently vows something to herself. Saeng vows &quot;when they come back in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again&quot;. @CAPS1 Ho chose to end the story this way because the story represents the guest for adaptation. Single-handedly, Saeng was able to say a vow to herself that showed she had accepted her new foreign home of america, even though she will always remember her homeland.
1	The author concludes this paragraph in the article because is the ron faldse in love with the plant and uses for a clock to tell her when she can take the test. It your not a @CAPS1.S citizen you can only take the driver’s test once a year.
1	The reason that the author concludes the story with this paragraph is because Saeng wants to do some thing good for herself. The reason I said this is cause in the last paragraph it says “Saeng vowed silently to herself “which means she wants what is best for herself.
3	Saeng believes that because she failed the driving test that she won’t be able the transition by a new country had she goes searching for her past. She finds her past in plants remembering Vietnam in deep sorrow. The narration states  “A were of less so deep and strong that it stung Saeng's eye…”(No) She remembers and misses everything she had she wanted her country her grandmother and her life. She came home to her mother with a plant and disappoint her mother with the cost but she understands the pain. The narration states “it’s a beautiful plant she finally said in sad you got it”(No). Eventually Saeng realizes how this plant affected her and how easily it survived and made a promise to herself. The narration states “and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test agin   
3	In the story “Winter Hibiscus.” The author ends the story with “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again. To show or emphasize that if the hibiscus, a plant reminding her of her home, can over then so can she. In the story after the author had failed her driving test and was walking back home, seeing the flowers reminded her of home &amp; connected her to her past making her felt less alone. For example, when the author says A wave of loss so deep &amp; strong that it stung Saeng’s eyes now swept over her.” That shows that she misses her home and the flower gave her a way to move deeply connect to her memories, also when she says “like the geese the distinctive V against the sky.” That shows that the geese were kind of like her they were moving to a different place to start a new. Making her feel that if they can adapt and change so will she over time In conclusion the ending was to futher emphasize her feeling towards her hometown and the new town she lives in.
2	The author ends the story like this in comparing to adapting changing or doing everything all over again for example; The geese fly  away when it gets cold but they always  come back giving their home another  chance .The Hibiscus is another  fine example , it buds  in  @DATE1  always  but  doesn’t  die  in  winter.  It always  returns . Saeng  has obviously realized  this  and vowed to  try her  drivers  test  again because it might work  this time . The author was trying to get the message spread of ,” don’t  give  up.”
3	Determination, help, strength – all are reasons why I beleieve the author concludes the story with the paragraph. First, determination is a @CAPS1 why Saeng will go back and take the test again. Saeng failed her drivers test the frst time and she wants to wait and do it again. Shes determinated to take different steps in order to pass the test. Secondly, I beleieve that help is a @CAPS1 why the author concluded with that paragraph. Saeng will need help in order to pass the test and she beleives that the hibiscus plant will help her pass and help her to do other things. The author is proving that she’ll go back and she’ll be ready. Finally, strength is the last @CAPS1 why the author chose the paragraph to end the story. Saeng beleieves that the hibiscus plant will give her the strength to pass the test. The author left off with the paragraph to show she will go back and she’ll be stranger than she was before. These are reasons why I beleieve the author concludes the story with that paragraph.
3	Mingfong Ho concludes “Winter Hibiscus” with the paragraph,”when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.&quot; This ending paragraph shows that Saeng will not give up in her struggle to adapt in this new place. Saeng has been going throug hard times; moving to the United States and failing her driver’s test. In the greenhouse Saeng even breaks down and crys. The hibiscus flower that saeng bought cost the family a lot of money, but to Saeng it was very important. This flower represented hope. When the flower buds again it would be the right time to take her driver’s test. The flower also represents adapting to a new place. As Saeng  adapts to the United States, the hibiscus adapts to the new garden. 
2	The author ends the story with this paragraph to show how Saeng changed. Saeng didn’t want to take the test and she had no confidence. In the story saengs mother supports her no matter what. She even understood when Saeng bought a plant for @MONEY1 because it reminded her of home. Now that Saeng has been comforted she feels more relaxed and she is ready and more confident to take the test again. therefore Saeng has changed.
7	I believe that people spend too much time on the computers. If people spend hours on the computer it will result in bad eye sight. They don’t get enough exercise.most teens aren't getting home work done because of this @CAPS1 people sit on the computer for countless hours their eye sight is slowly going bad. The bright lights of the screen make your eyes unclear state say more people lose eyesight from looking of a computer than they would by staring at a light. Sitting down in front of the screen you aren't down in front of the screen you arents getting any exercise. You mostly just move your hands and fingers. If people dont exercise for at least @NUM1 minutes a day, we will all become week. Lastly, your teenager probably do their homework. while they are in his or her room they've most likely all the computers. if they spend too much time on the computer they are more likely to fail their classes. which means they will most likely stay back. In other words, people spend too much time on the computer. If we continue this most people will lose eye sight. if citizens keep sitting there then we will became unhealthy. And lastly, more teens want do homework and wont succeed.
3	The author concludes the story with “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to  herself , in the spring. When the snows melt and the geese situation and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again. “The   author chose this to end   the story to show that you need to keep faith in your heart. Saeng   was still a bit homesick throughout the story. That could have possibly impacted how she did on her driving test. If one   waited a season or two, her homesickness would most likely drift away and she would be able to focus on meeting her goal. Missing her grandmother and her home in Vietnam must have taken a huge tell on her if it had anything to do with why she failed her driving test. Another reason the author could be that he wanted to lighten the mood up a little bit. Saeng breaking down in the greenhouse had a very melancholy feeling to it, and her vowing to herself that she would take the test over once spring come around kind of lifted your hopes up for her.
1	The Author concludes this story with that paragraph because she is saying that she could not concentrate on the test because she wanted to go back to her home country.
0	The author probally ended with this to show the feeling that Saeng will return and help out again. So Saeng must like to plant. She probaly might hep his mom with alot more things now that she can see what helping might lead too.   
3	In the story ‘’Winter Hibiscus,‘’ the author ends the story with Saeng ‘s thoughts. The thought of trying the test when the hibiscus starts budding ties the story together. The story is mainly about how she looks for a flower and the memories it brings. But she wouldn’t have gone to the shop if she passed the test. This creates a full understanding of the test and hibiscus. It also shows the importance of the hibiscus. Both Saeng and the flower must adapt to survive and are out of place. Saeng was from Vietnam and the flower was from a shop, both were moved from where they belong to a new place.In some ways Saeng is the flower. She must adapt to her home to survive. The flower, outside in the cold, must adapt to its surroundings in order to survive. When she knows the flower survived the harsh winter, she will realize that she can survive living in @LOCATION2. This would make her feel strong and focused. 
3	In in Winter Hibiscus by Minfong Ho, the last paragraph is a vow by the main character (Saeng) to retake her driver’s test when spring comes and her hibiscus is budding. The author concludes the story with that paragraph because it gives a sense of hope to the sad story. It suggests that Saeng will be okay and will move past her longing for the country of her birth. “And in the war on moist shelter of the greenhouse, Saeng broke down and wept. “Saeng was so sad and miserable. All of the flowers reminded her home country. She was depressed and homesick. When she got home, she planted a hibiscus plant in the frozen ground when it would bloom in the spring it would represent a new life and another chance. It meant that Saeng would not give up. Minfong Ho concluded Winter Hibiscus on a positive note with the last paragraph.
1	Why the counclude the story saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, When the snows melt and geese return and this hibiscus is budding then I will will take that test again is to leave suspense. But he mean that saeng ate all the plant so next year she will have the test not to eat it. This is why the author ended the story with that.
1	The author concludes the story with this paragraph. Forexample, It gives the Story a good and happe ending.
1	The author ends the story with this paragraph because he wants the reader to feel like she is going to accomplish something because of the hibiscus and the geese. An example of her accomplishing something because of hibiscus is when the author mentions how her and her grandmother use to spend time together and do things together and her grandmother would do her hair and then put a hibiscus flower into it. Also the geese are a sing of accomplishment because she sees them in the sky flying south so they can survive the cold winter months in a warm place.
0	The reason why he concludes this with this paragraph is because he is telling how the story ends. The reason behind that is so people know's what happens.
2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph in order to end the story on an optimistic note. Saeng’s problem is her “wave of loss” that sweeps over her during her memories of her home country. This entire story deals with Saeng’s depressing struggle with finding joy in her life in a new, unfamiliar and seemingly unwelcoming country. This feeling of loss and loneliness is magnified by the test then Saeng failed. After a story of such depression, the author shows @CAPS1 newly found confidence and optimism by ending the story with this paragraph.
7	Dear @ORGANIZATION1, I agree with some of the perfesionals that think the computer keeps people from exersising, enjoying nature, and spending quality time with friends and family. Some people thnk it's cool to be on the computer @NUM1 @NUM2. The truth is the computer with internet is like having @CAPS1 at your fingure tips, distractions, and more. You can find just about anything on the internet these days. Some people use the internet for doing homework. Sometimes people can find the exact answers to an assiment. That means they are becoming more dependant on tecnologie. If the world becomes more and more dependent on the of computers and such, that could mean things. the world is suffering because people are neglecting to pick up their trash and to try to stop @ORGANIZATION2. Most people, instead of taking action, will be on the computer. People are becoming more and more lazy these days. As I stated most people are becoming more and more lazy these days because all they have to do to have fun is sit and do little movement. Saying that, people are neglecting to exercise and eat right. They are also neglecting to spend time with friends and family. Instead of texting or @CAPS2 someon try to call them. Or maybe even wehn you're free you can go and make plans to visit with your family. Taht's all I ask is that you especially spend time with family because you can always get more friends or anew computer. But your cant get a new family.
1	She concludes the story with this paragraph because she want to let the readers of the story that she is not willing to give up and and that she is willing to take the test again and pass it.
1	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it shows that she adapted her  new home. Also, it concludes the story so it shows the leader her last thoughts. So its like its, the  last thing , and subject  that  you  that  you  think  the author  concludes  the  story with  this  paragraph ,” when  they  come  back , in the spring , when the snows melt and  the  geese  return  and  this  hibiscus is budding , then  I  will  take that  test  again.”
0	They author concludes the story with this paragraph because he want to see what people would say.
0	This saying is saying that the snow has already fallen down onto their garden and when the snow melts, they will have to recrop everything again. This is a perfect conclusion to end this story. The story is talking about how the flowers grow in the spring and how saeng’s mom grows fruits and veggies in her garden. So since it snowed and their would be a while before the spring come back. Saeng has alot of planning to do in the next spring. The hibiscus will be budding and the geese will return.
2	In the story I think the author concludes  that  paragraph  with  the  story  because  Saeng  is  saying  that  when  she  comes  back  or when  she next  sees  the  hibiscus  bloom  again  she  will  then  take  the  test  but  until then  she  feels  out  of  place  and  she  is no use to the  arrangements  she is living in  now  and  she  feels  uncomforatable  but  until  then  she  thinks  that she will not  be able  to do  will  until  she  is in  her  bloms  tow  a  where  it  is  horman   for  her.
1	The author concludes with that paragraph because show that she will go back to the one place and will not break down like that and grif over what she has lost and have to deal with change.
1	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because when it snows plants die and won’t grow back until the snow melts, the geese return and the hibiscus is budding then she will she how her garden will be in the spring. Therefore the author put this paragraph in the end because Saeng loves gardening so much ever since she moved to the United States. Ever since the family moved to the United States the family has never been happier for being together having dinner and planting together they had the time of there life planting all the time.
2	If you have ever had to move from your home town or country, you how comforting something can be that’s from your old country and in your knew one. The fact that Saeng had geese and plants and everything else comforted her enough to know that next spring she can take the test. Throughout the story it seemed as if everything that Saeng ever saw that she had in her home country of Vietnam in some way warmed and comforted her. Early in the story it illustrates her feelings as she makes her way through the green house Many times in the story you could always “hear” that sense of love when she would call plant by its native languages name. Throughout the story you could always sense the love and caring she had. The author knows how she loves those things and that they would encourage her. Therefore that’s why he concluded the story as such. 
2	The author concludes this paragraph with the story because of the potintal of the hibiscus. So Saeng will go take the test again no matter she already took it and failed. She is like the hibiscuc. The hibiscus seems out of place and is determined to survive when the snow melts. So she will go take the test again and us the hibiscus as her modifation.
1	The author had concluded the story with the paragraph When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again because the author wanted the reader to notice how the mother and the child bond with gardening. Between the different things that author has said about Saeng and Saeng’s mother. He as in the author shows a way they have bonded they being Saeng and Saeng’s mother which I think it was fairly neat they way the author had bid out this story. It was a fairly interesting story to it kept you guessing, on the end of year seat, wondering. But I enjoyed reading that story. I had also liked how the daughter and mother were so great friends. But it was a nice thing to see with the daughter and the mother being so in touch with each other. Also, in doing this the author has shown some of his ways of thinking. The author shows us he a great mind and a good way thinking. This author is telling us a great story of a girl and her mother it sounded very good to me. This story is a gardening story of a daughter and her mom moving from Vietnam and moving to the @ORGANIZATION1 to live out the rest of their lives.
10	Dear Newspaper @CAPS1, @CAPS2 people believe that the negatives of computers out weigh the positives. I believe that computers help as much more than hurt. There are a few minor instances where computers have hurt people, but @CAPS2 more instances where they have helped @CAPS2 people. There are some cases that a victim of an accident recovers with the help of computers. Likewise there are other times that close family or friends can talk to each other over the @CAPS3. Also, people could learn about amazing places. Thus computers are very vital to us. Computers are vital to us because they help our reflexes. In my experience as a computer engineer. I have learned that playing or using a computer call help victims of reflex damaging accidents. A computer helps the victim by giving them a better feel on their environment. The victem could see exactaly what he is doing and so could his and doctors. Like wise to the physical treatment, computers an relief. Thus the patient gets stronger physically and mentaly. Thus, computers help a humans life be enchacing their reflexes. Likewise to help our reflexes, computers with the @CAPS3 would help people that are distance apart could connect. One of the ways people very far away connect is with soldiers and their families. Back in my military days, nothing helped better than talking. The easiest way of this was talking over. It gave me a gigantic. Thus computers are vital to as humans. Likewise, computers help us see places that are amazing. For example, when a @NUM1 year-old boy visits a website that talks about the wonders of the @LOCATION1 rain forest. He then tells his science class, who the spread the word of preservation of the forest. The boy then grows up to be an explorer of the @LOCATION1, finding new speceses. All this would happen because he was on a computers. Computers help us see the unseen. In the end, computers are great if used in regulation. They help victims heal, soldiers connect and inspire the youth, Computers are vital source of knowledge and advancement for humans.
1	There could be many reasons the author concludes the story with that paragraph. It could be because Saeng wants to pass the test now to make her mother happy. It could also be because she will need to be able to drive in the next year for some reason. Maybe it’s because it cost her money to keep taking it. She really likes her hibiscus though.
2	The author concludes the story in this way to show that Saeng is a determined undividual. It is symbolic for when the geese return she will take the test again because when they left she had failed. The snow melting and the hibiscus budding show spring and spring is usually the start of a fresh and new begininig. The last paragraph its like a symbol for starting fresh. Saeng was upset about failing the test ‘She said, “I–I failed the test.” By stuttering that shows she was upset. Since she was upset giving it time until she takes the test again is good. The author ended the story with this paragraph to show Saeng is strong and will have a fresh and new start.
2	I feel the author concludes the story with the paragraph to show that Saeng found some sense of relief with the flower. It also show that Saeng wasnt going to give up and she was going to keep trying. At first she was sad and upset but when she saw the flower that reminded her of home, she became happy and didn’t feel so bad about failing the test. The flower had a deep impact on her cause it reminded of home and when she started thinking about her grandmother she became a little sad, but then she thought about the flower and how much it meant to her, she felt comfort from the flower. I feel the concludes the story in good positive way.
1	I think the author concludes the story with the paragraph to leave us with hope. Saeng is going to retake the test she failed. Saeng is having a hard time adjusting to her new life, by waiting until the snow melts, the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, Saeng gives herself time to adapt and heal. The paragraph show’s Saeng’s courage and hope about retaking the test.
1	Honestly I'm not quite sure. Maybe because she fees assured now. Maybe its a mental trial we all must face. Maybe the geese returning and the plant budding is a metaphoric test too.
2	The author chooses to end the story with this paragraph to get across the theme of acceptance and determination. Saeng is very attached to the hibiscus plant because for her it represents her homeland and all the things she left behind. This last line represents many things. The snow melting, the geese returning, and the hibiscus budding all indicate a time of rebirth and new beginnings. The fact the Saeng wants to retake her test shows how obstacles can be overcome, and goals achieved
0	The concludes the story way because that the way he want for the gril to end it. Cause she all about them flowers, plant, animals. She likes Madagascar periwinhle. The places went she use to live is gorse with plants, animals, flowers.
2	In the story “Winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho the author concluded the story with a paragraph that showed feeling. The paragraph showed that the girl Saeng was determined to pass the test, For example the text states “the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again”. It shows that even though she failed it once she isn’t going to let that stop her. The girl also expresses somewhat how she feels about the geese and the plant. For example the text states “when they come back, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding”. It shows that she doesn’t regret buying the hibiscus.  
3	The author concludes the story “Winter Hibiscus “ this way because she is  creating a sense of hope that Saeng feels for the future. Saeng  was feeling very sad when she was walking home from failing her drivers test. The author describes this scene as “The wind was blowing harder, tearing off the last remnants of green in the chicory weeds.” The winter and cold represent Saeng losing hope. When she gets home and shows her mother the hibiscus, her mother says that it is “strong enough to make it through the cold months here”. This symbolizes Saeng making it through as well. At the end of the story, Saeng  sees geese and realizes that “many of the things she had thought of as strange before had become, through the qunet  repition of season upon season, almost familiar to her”. This shows that she really is adjusting to her new home, and has hope for when spring comes, and the geese return, and hibiscus bloom.
0	She wanted to catch them, that was her whole goal and purpose of hunting.  Trying to catch geese. She saw her grandparents try to do it. In conclusion this is why she made that last statement.
10	Dear @CAPS1, I believe computers are a huge benefit to society. I myself have a computer; it is very important and useful to me. Over @PERCENT1 of the families in our town own at least one computer. Computers are a great source of information. They also allow you to talk to people, even if they are far away. They are also very convenient and easy to use, in mu opinion. Based on these positives, @CAPS3't you agree with my opinion? Computers are a great source of information. Unlike books, which you must find and buy, there is an enormous amount of information just a mouse click away! With computers, you can learn about far away places and people without having to visit or talk to them. Let me compare this to a book. Let's say you wanted to do research on @PERSON1. You would have to go to the library and search for a book about him. And what would you do if you couldn't find one about him? With a computers you could type &quot;@CAPS2 of @PERSON1&quot; into a search engine and receive of information in under a minute! I love saving time, and computers help me do that. They also augment the information I use. Another astounding development in computer technology is that you can talk to other, no matter where their location is. Email is extremely faster than writing a letter. having to pay to travel. Who @CAPS3't like that? Computers are very convenient. You can surf the internet, talk to people, and much more from the comfort of your bedroom. There are jobs that you can do from home on a computer. No need to go anywhere to work. My uncle is one of those people. He is s stockbroker, and operates his whole job from the computer in his house. It is a convenient and a well-paying job. I asked him what he thought of his job. He said, &quot;I love my job because I can work when I want to work, and from the comfort of my home.&quot; @CAPS3't you want to have his job? I would most definately. In conclusion, computers are very beneficial to us. Did you know computers were first invented by @ORGANIZATION1 to perform calculations that were very long? Look at what they have involved into @DATE1. They bring us information at amazing speeds. They let us talk to people all over the world. They are very convenient. These are major benefits to society, and everybody should embrace computers.
2	The author concluded the story will this paragraph because she wants the readers to understand that she didn’t give up on the plant and that she’s determine. For example the story state that Saeng said “I-I failed the test,” She felt as though she didn’t accomplish what she wanted to. So at the end of the story she said “I will take that test again.” To show what kind of person she is and she not going to just give up just because she failed the first time.
2	In the story “Winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho, the author concludes the story with this paragraph because in the spring time everything is reborn and in the spring time Saeng will be used to her surroundings. One example of this is when the author states &quot;she relazed that many of the things that she had thought of as strange befor had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost fimilar to her now. This means that with every season she get more used to her new home and if became more like her and with every season. Another is when the author say’s she lifted her head and watched as their distinctive V was etched against the evening sky, slowly fading to the distance.” This reminds her of her old home watching the geese.
3	In the story, Saeng is being forced to adapt to an abrupt change when her family moves from vietnam to the United States. The story tells of how different things in the @LOCATION3 spark a memory of her life back in Vietnam. The second to last paragraph talks about the hibiscus, and the geese and the change of seasons. The last paragraph sums all that up, and how when everything farmiliar to her in Vietnam is being symbolized in the @LOCATION3, she will continue to try driving, and, ultimately, adapt to the changes the @LOCATION3 has brought her. This shows that Saeng can overcome her obstacles of the country, and is determined to do so. This paragraph is placed at the conclusion of the story because it reflects the theme of change and adaption throughout the story, but mostly reflection. The author takes time to explain how each individual item in the story reminds saeng of her old home, and in an effort to raise the tone of the story from regret and sadness to hope and optimism, the author recollects each each item in the final paragraph, showing that there is hope for Saeng and her family.  
0	The author concluded the story with this paragraph, “When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” The concludes the story with the paragraph above because it shows Saeng is a carring person to nature. I know this because of this quote, “one of the blossoms had fallen off, and carefully Saeng picked it up and smelled it.” This quote show that she cares for the little things in nature. Another quote that show Saeng is caring towards nature is, “she tipped the pot and deftly eased the ball of soil out, balancing the rest of the plant in her other hand.” This shows that Saeng is very caring to a small plant, which is part of nature. So in conclusion the author concluded the story with the paragraph above to show the Saeng is a carring person towards nature.
1	I think the author concludes the story with that paragraph because it helps to explain the significance of the hibiscus. The hibiscus are very important to her and her culture. When there hibiscus around, Saeng feels that she can do anything. That is why she failed the test in the first place. So she is saying that the next time she takes the test, she will have the strength from the hibiscus to help her pass the test.
2	This shows that she has not givven up and is going to try hard to adopte and do well in this new land. It leavs a sad story off with a happy ending. The hibiscus is a sigh of hope and so is spring, this makes the en time thing be fkor, without this part the story would be a sad one, but with it is one of hope. The way that the rest of the story is told is as if this is a turning point or an end to the en time boot. It is on resa lution without a resolution.
1	The authors concludes the passage with this paragraph phrase to show that after all of that hear tacke and confusion she knows it will take time to adjust and she realizeses that she’ll be ready given time to heal and start fresh, just as he plant.
1	The author concludes the story with this paragraph. because she wants to make a goal for herself in the future. She wants to pass the test, and she will try hard to do it next year. For example, her mother was mad she didn’t pass the test, but then soon forget about it. Saeng did not forget about failing the test. She vowed herself to the hibiscus because she loves that plant and will do anything for it.
2	The author ends the passage with this sentence to show that in order to succed, one must keep trying. Saeng will adapt to her new copiuntry in time but not if she spends heer time wishing to go back to her homeland. The hibiscus is a reminder to hers of starting a new and adapting to society. Saeng will retry her driver’s test when the plant buds again, starting its life cycle all over again
1	She is say that she will take the test again after the snow melts in the spring. So she can watch the geese the hibiscus bud while she is taking her test and try to pass it.
11	Readers of &quot;@LOCATION2 @CAPS1&quot; should be well informed of the benifets of computers to society. Not only do they teach hand-eye coordination, but they give people the ability to learn about faraway places and provide a means to easy, online communication. In this day and age, good coordination is esencial to prospering in society. Using computers provides a method of both establishing and improving hand-eye coordination from the comfort of your own household or workplace. Dr. @DR1, of @ORGANIZATION1 medical center, says that a recent study shows @NUM1 out of every @NUM2 computers users have better hand-eye coordination than people who do not operate on a computer regularly. In a local primary school, students have begun to &quot;@CAPS2 to learn&quot;, a program that promotes quick typing. School officials have seen a dramatic increase in the typing speed of children since the program was started in @DATE1. In this way, the computer provides a secure route to better hand-eye coordination. Even more importantly, the hand-eye coordination gained from using a computer can increase the chances of getting a job involving computer hand-eye coordination as an adult such as the position of a secretary or grafic designer. While hand-eye coordination is a factor of computers that has an extremely positive effect on people, the ability to learn about distant places with the touch of a keyboard is even more benificial towards all users. Website such as google and yahoo can track down millions of results in a matter of seconds if you search the name of a city or country. This can be handy when working on school projects as well; instead of having to lug tens of books home to finish an essay on @LOCATION1, you can simply look up the information on a computer at your house. When summertime comes around, and the last school bell rings, you can instead research faraway places that could turn into vacation spots instead of homework assignments. All of the travel information from plane tickets to the right currency is at your fingertips on a computer. If &quot;@LOCATION2 @CAPS1&quot; readers were aware of this, lots of trouble would be prevented and lots of time would be saved. The one component of computers that is used even more than research is online communication. State officials, governers, and even the president can post messages on websites for citizens to view while they check the weather or their email. This is a much easier way to hear goverment statements than waiting through endless commercials to hear speeches on the @CAPS4. Social networking sites are also immensly popular, and on pages like facebook and twitter you can reconnect with people who you don't have the chance to see everyday, or don't lie relative vincinity. If your cousin is going to school abroad, and did not have access to an international phone, you could communicate with them through email on the computer, and it would be as if they never left. It is ridiculous to think that someone could find computers - the gateway to faraway places, good hand-eye coordination, and the connection ten distant friends and family - a concern to society. They help town in countless ways and &quot;@CAPS5 @CAPS1&quot; readers should be aware of this.
8	Dear @CAPS1, I think computers have a positive effect on people because it will help you with interacting, learning and coordination. By interacting with people like far away friends or unknown frieds. If they are far its a nice way to send photos back and forth to see how the person/people are doing. Family is a very important factor in computers because if you havent seen the person you can tell how they are progressing in life. If thats not the case you can meet new people. By meeting new people you have more connections in your life and more people to trust. Learning! Learning is a good thing for adults an children. Computers can teach children by showing them new words, colors shapes and sizes. For an adult it can show them meanings of words or new words. Words, colors and sizes can all be round on a computer all by learning. A computer can not only do mental things to affect you also physical like coordination. You can improve your coordination by making you stronger when you type. Your hands are a big thing in like and they are helpful in a lot of ways. By sitting up straight in your computer chair all day can improve your posture. Your back can get straigher from all time you are sitting. Your mind can be foucused and in one pot fucusing on thing is good for you such as the computer screen. Now, people can think that computers are good for you too. But there could be negative ideas for people who think the opposite way.
1	The author ended this story with this paragraph because thats now Saeng felt. She felt connteced  to the geese  and the hibiscus ,” She had lifted her head and watched as their distinctive was etched ,”  “ almost familiar to her now ,” She will retake the test in the spring . The hibiscus and the flower will make he feel better in the spring . she should pass the test.
3	The author concludes with this paragraph to show how the hibiscus flower profoundly implanted Saeng’s life and gave her new found courage and strength. For example, while on her way home after failing her driver’s test, Saeng sees a flower and says, “[I] felt a shock of recognition so intense, it was almost visceral.” This shows the deep concentration between Saeng and the hibiscus and it is this connection that will guide her through the tough times. Saeng subsequently was into a flower shop and identified all the flower there from her childhood. She realizes that her old home had all these flowers and Saeng used this connection to her past to further increase her courage in adapting into her knew life. Another example is when in the text it states, “She realized that many of the things she thought of was strange before had become…almost familiar to her now.” Saeng comes to this realization by listening to her mother talk of how the hibiscus flower which normally survived at her old home would be able to survive here. She understood that she too would be able to do so and not think things like big @CAPS1 here would be strange anymore. It is in this way that the hibiscus tree offers Saeng support, courage and even strength.  
1	“When they come back,Saeng vowed silently to herself .in the spring ,when the snow melt and the geese return and his hibiscus is budding ,then I will take the test again “.So which mean when they come back she has to make a test up ,so they don’t have to worry about it later.But  on there trip they seen a lot of different thing ,the soil was cold and hard they couldn’t much with it.She though it was walking into another world ,hot, moist world exploding with with greenery @CAPS1  frends and ones of shades and shapes grew in seemingly random profusion .And beside it was yet another old  friend a small shrub with waxy leaves and the dainty flower with the purplish petals and white centers .It was already dusk when Saeng reach home ,the wind was blowing hard tearing off last remants of green in the chicory weeds that grew thre the crack of the sidwak .So @CAPS2 to they saw a lot of thing on their trip.So saw thing  they never  seen before like the wed growin therw the sidewalk.
1	I think the author includes this to show the determination to pass this test no matter what.
3	The author might conclude the story with this because it shows that the girl had confidence that when the flower blooms she will be able to pass. Back at her home land that flower mean't alot to her and it still does. But it seems like this flower gives her hope and pride. She used to pick it with her grandmother and put it in her hair. So when she sees the flower, she will think of her grandmother and that will motivate her to keep going. The flower is strong and can stand through winter weather, so the girl is determinded that when the flower blooms, she will be able to past the test.
0	The author conclude the story with “When they came back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again”.because she wanted to grow hibiscus in the winter time. She had failed the first time and she wanted to redeem herself and do it the second time arround. She didn’t want to fail again so she did some things differently. She planted it with care patted the soil down firmly around the plant. That is why the author concludes the story with that paragraph.
2	The girl says that she is going to take the test again when the Hibiscus blooms shows that she misses her country and still wants to be connected somehow. When she takes the test as the plant blooms its like support from her country. The plant is symbolic of her progress because her growth is like the plant. When she first got it she wast ready to go out and do things she still hadnt adapted lutlly to the environment just like the hypiscus wast adapted to the wather and had to wait till @DATE1 to bloom.
2	“then I will take that test again” [@NUM1] Saeng’s whole intention in the story was to take the test and pass it. Houever, &quot;I-@CAPS1] failed the test, [Ho, @NUM2] which brought the whole story together. She yearned for comfort as she seeked the “@CAPS2 Malik” [Ho, @NUM3] for comfort. Seeing this brought back all the memories of her life “back home” [@NUM1] that kept her going. As a result, bonding with her mother erupted, and it brought another day of hope for her future in her new home. Enough hope for her to say, “when they come back in the spring when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.”
0	The author ended this story with this sentence because it’s a good conclution. It’s a good conclution because it closes by telling what she will do. This is good  because it shows that Saeng had finally realized that she needs to take that test even though she likes nature so much.
2	The autor of &quot;winter Hibiscus&quot; conclded the story with this paragraph because it shows that saeg is going to give the test another try. The author wanted to slow that saeg was not going to giving up in that when the thing that was most important to her was complete that she would then take the test again. In the sory it says that &quot;saeg did not dare look at her mother in the eye. Instead, she stared at the hibiscus is what was important t
8	Dear Local Newspaper, I think computers have both good and bad effects on people. Some people just sit around all day playing games and being lazy. Other people actually use their computers for things that they need. Also some people need their computers for their jobs. I do agree that some people who spend all day in front of their computers are spending less time exercising! Would you rather play games all day instead of spending some quality time with your family and friends? Not me, I would much rather be with friends outside or having a family picnic at a park or lake. For other people though, the story is much different. Some people need computers and other advances in technology for their everyday life. A lot of jobs today require you to use a computer, for example working at a bank you use computers all day! I also think students rely on computers to do work too. A lot of students type up reports and other things for school on their computers. Students also use computers to look up information. The internet can be a very good source for students. I know for me, the internet has come in handy for school projects, or maybe something as simple as just looking up a word. I can also see why people dont really care about advaces in technology or computers! Some people dont need them for anything, and some are probably thinking people are on them way too much. To me, I honestly find computers useful because I can talk online to my family in @LOCATION1. I hope you liked my opinion about computers, remember, they are useful to some people, but not all.
1	In the story, “Winter Hibiscus”, ends by, “when they come back, saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” The author concludes that story with that quote because the author sees spring as a new beginning. The author knows to work hard and needs to starts over. For example, some students fail the second semester and look at winter as a new start.
0	The author ends the story with the paragrap and because it is winter time and she can not do anything in the winter because of the snow. The snow made it so that she would have to take a test in the spring.
2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show that Saeng has overcome an obstacle in her life and that she is learning to move on. In the story Saeng is often stuck on past memories rather than making new ones. For example, when Saeng goes to the florist shop to purchase the plant, she starts remembering old memories from her homeland. When she sees the plant labeled “jasmine”, she thinks of her grandmother that died and remembers how she used to put jasmine blossoms in her hair. Also, she tells her mother that the hibiscus she bought is “not a real one” and she also says it’s “not like the kind we had before.” @CAPS1, she keeps comparing her new life to her old life in her homeland and she does not allow her new experiences to be as good as her old ones. @CAPS1 when the author concludes the story with that paragraph, it shows growth in the girl, Saeng, and that she is willing to move on and make new memories, such as trying to pass her driving test again.
0	The author concludes the story with this pharagraph because the story is coming to and end. The author putting that sweet touch on its saying it will become string again and the beautiful flowers will blossom. Letting the readers know that the nature will continue, The season will come back around.
0	This paragraph @NUM1 includes to let the reader know it's winter. you know its winter because in the passage its says when the snow melt.
2	 Tisaeng had failed her drivers test after she went to &quot;flour is it and bought” a plant it was the &quot;dok faeng – noi&quot;, she had fond memories about the plant. She remembered it from Vietnam, and how it used to be everywhere all the time. She had bought “@CAPS1 hibiscus” as a comfort to herself. The  last paragraph says,” “When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again.” Saeng figured out that things happen for a reason and opportunities occur over and over again. Just as the geese go south and @CAPS2 as the seasons change. She had decided she will retake the test next time she gets a change.
3	The author concluded the story with the paragraph ”When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” To show that the character has become a part of her new environment. Just like the environment, she is constantly going through changes, and in the spring when all things that couldn’t be their best during winter begun to thrive, she will too. And when she begins thriving and feels like herself again, then she’ll be ready to take the driving test, and pass. She’ll have returned to her old self like the geese return home when she's done crying like the snow’ s done melting, and when she’s done crying like the snow’s done melting, and when she’s ready to open up, just like the hibiscus begin budding, she’ll be ready to take the test.
2	All throughout the story “Winter Hibiscus”, the author gives the feeling as hope and comfort that is obtaned by Saeng when she thinks about the past. And to continue this feeling as hope, the last sentence gives the feeling that Saeng will be better off than she had been at the beginning of the story. For example, at the beginning of the story, Saeng was feeling alrenated, alone, and misplaced in her new country. But as the story progresses, she starts to develop peace of mind and certainly that her future will be brighter with the passing of the and her growing confidence. In conclusion, the author uses the last sentence to give a feeling of hope for Saeng’s future and growing confidence.
0	The meaning of the last phrase is to see if the winter hibiscus canre seed and go threw everything to become a flower for the year and repeat the process. 
3	Minfong Ho concluded “Winter Hibiscus” with that paragraph to show hope and renewal for the character Saeng. Spring represents birth and renewal, a second chance for Saeng. She had previously failed what seems to be an important test (perhaps her citizenship test), and motivated her to try and remember her past, which she sorely misses. The winter hibiscus seems to represent herself, and this illustrates it: “it’s-it’s not a real one,” Saeng mumbled she was still too shaky to say the words at home, lest she burst into tears again. ‘Not like the kind we had before’ I know her mother said quietly' 'its flowers aren’t as pretty, but it’s strong enough to make it through the cold months here, this winter hibiscus. That is what matters. This describes Saeng’s position perfectly – she is not the same, as happy as she once was, but she can make it through the hard times, and can bloom in the spring to take the test again. This shows the purpose of the last paragraph in “winter hibiscus” to show the renewal and hope that Saeng will experience.
12	Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 and kids of any age at this society, are way to focused on the latest technology. One piece of equptment that is affecting peoples lives, is the computer. We need to get rid of this habbit and learn to do different activites! People are spending way to much time on computers and less time enjoying nature excersing, and need to interact with friends and family more take the time to agree with me as I confront you on how the computer is taking over our lives! Is time flying you by? Are you overwhelmed, at how life passes you so quickley? Well, if you answered yes, stop the computer madness and head on outside! Your no enjoying nature! Nature is as beautiful as a gorgeous scene of @CAPS3 @CAPS4 love oceans with pink sand. Who would want to miss this? @PERCENT1 of @CAPS2 complain that they rarely enjoy what life has to take on the outside of your house. Just think you won't be able to see the stupendous, the seasons changing, withought going outdoors. &quot;I want my @CAPS6, to experience the wide variety of nature as she grows old.&quot; @CAPS5 of her daughter. Well, @MONTH1 I add, little @CAPS6 is not going to get much nature out of her, if she does not get her eyes unglued to the comuter screen! Yes, comuters, are very brilliant, and have lots to do, but if you want to be missing out on the new trees being discovered every day, be my guest! @PERCENT2 of all the population in the @LOCATION2 is overweight due to technology brought into our world. The greatest impart is the computer! high-paid physicians try and teach their parents at a young age, to go out and play sports - while excersing at the same time and nor to stay home and play videogames. Now you tell me, would you rather get a good healthy excersise, and have all the energy you need or would you like to slowy add on to your and gain issues as you the internet? I remember @DATE1, I grabred my nike hightops, and my pink ipod I started jogging at a slow while listening to my favorite song.

If you try and prove me wrong just remember, nature is a big and many people are missing out on the advantage technology is taking over peoples excersing habbits, and many families are less bonding @CAPS10's up to you keep the population of @LOCATION1 in good hands!
1	I think that this sentence was choosen to be the last sentence because it shows that Saeng can pass the test. Although she is not at her homeland she still has the ability to do things. As the plant that reminds of home returns and begins to grow Saeng will do the same. I think that it is a good sentence to be at the end and it leaves you wondering if she will pass the test.
1	She end, the story with that because the flower gives her strength. It gives her hope and reminds her of home. At her home they were every where, she had to buy this one. She planted it so it can grow through winter. After winter the flower gets huge and she passes her driver test. For reward her mom get her a real Vietnam flower.
0	I think he concludes his story with that paragraph because she know she was wrong and she want’s to make it up to her mother. Also she is showing her mother how much she really likes nature.
1	I think the author concludes the story with this paragraph because she failed her driving test the first time and she was saying to herself that she will take it again.
0	I think the author used that response because she was showing that she had to go through another @DATE1 or hard work in planting flowers.
3	The author concluded the story “Winter Hibiscus “ the way she did because she wanted to show saeng ‘s determination at one point in the story, the author wrote, “she was still too shaky to say the words at home “.  Saeng really missed her old life and her old country. She often wonders when she will be able to go back to it and enjoy herself, because she still has trouble adjusting to her new life. When the author concluded the story, it was done so that saeng could be shown as a person   who would not easily give up. Although she’d had   previous trouble, the end of the story gives new hope for saeng to adjust to her new surroundings. Also, when saeng fails the test, the ending sentence gives newhopes saeng told her mother,”I failed the test “, and she was really down on herself when she said so. The closing sentence gives new hope to saeng and the reader,  that she will work header and do better in the spring. The author shows saeng’s determination to rise above failure   and create a niche of her own in life. In all, the closing sentence in “winter Hibiscus” is used to show saeng’s determination.
1	I think the author concludes the story with that paragraph because she fells to live the geese and her memories relate to the times she sees the geese. I think that her test is in school but she has believe that she’ll pass it by remembering her memories she fells conected to the outside ness. For example, she loves flowers. Thats why I think the author concludes the story with that paragraph.
3	The author concludes the story, “Winter Hibiscus&quot;, with a very spiritual and confident paragraph to show that hope has an important part in our lives. In the story, ”Saeng&quot;, a foreign chinese citizen, is touched and flattened by all the majestic plants and nature that was living in the green house. She ventures to find all the plants that remind her of home and to relate them to her past experiences. As she walks through the green house, she whispers and pronounces the names of the nature she sees, “Saebba&quot;, Saeng whispered, “Madagascar periwinkle”, its tag pronounced. “How strange to see it in a pot, Saeng thought. Back home it just grew wild.!! But as her tour grew with time, she soon relizes she is missing some of her memories, and begins to cry. As she reaches home she is greeted by her mother. “I-I failed the test,” Saeng said. Saeng's mother is touched by her comment, and cheers her up with planting the “hibiscus&quot;. In the end, the author shows strong expression by writting one last paragraph to bring out hope, and emotion, to represent that everyone deserves a second chance.
0	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because he basically saying hes never taking that test again. The author is showing that the character doesn’t like this test. And would rather not take it
3	The author of the story ends it with a very interesting paragraph. This paragraph talks about over coming obstacles and is telling the reader to try again. It is important to never give up and to keep trying until you sucede. In the story Saeng had just moved away from Vietnam she really missed it, and on top of it saeng failed her drivers test. She was really upset. She saw a group of geese flying above her and said when they come back in the spring and my new plant starts to grow I will retake my drivers test. Geese have to overcome the cold by flying south for the winter. The cold weather is an obstacle for them. Also her new plant can't grow until its warm. Her plant has to over come being small until it can bud in the spring. People face obstacles all the time. You have to keep trying inorder to get around them.
8	Dear Newspaper, In think that computers are not good for the society. There are three reasons why I think this and these are the following; @CAPS1, people don't get to spend time with their family. Second, you can get misspell words using instant messenger. When your doing your homework you can get distrated by the computer. The @CAPS1 reason why computers are bad for the society is because people don't spend enough time with their family, I know I don't. I spend at least half my day staring at a screen when I could be outside walking my dog with friends. Furthermore, instant messenger is the most addicting. When I type something, I use abreveations for any word. The professor at @LOCATION1 says at least @PERCENT1 students spell abreveated words in tests. For example, if you wanted to spell &quot;what&quot; instead the @PERCENT1 would spell &quot;@CAPS2&quot;. Finally, my last reason why I think computers are not good for society is because you can get distracted by it a lot. I know that because I am driven to the world of computers. When ever I do my homework. I can't keep my eyes off the screen. Therefore explains that computers are not good for society. In conclusion, computers keep you from spending time with your family, has students misspelling words, and distracting you from doing your homework. I hope you agree with me on this.
2	The short story “winter Hibiscus end the way it does because the narrator realizes that with simply comes a new chance or opportunity to start over a rebirth. One passage from the text that shows the narrator’s hope, “Almost reluctantly, she realised that many of the things that he had thought of as strange before, through that quiet repetition of season upon season,almost familiar to her now (Ho @NUM1). This passage of text shows that she realized that alot of things to her before suddenly had purpose. She realized that there is a new rebirth in the spring. The conclusion sentences states that she is going to retake the test in the spring. She now realizing that she now by a whole new opportunity and life to start. The conclusion sentence of “Winter Hibiscus” is one of realization of opportunity with spring beginning.
2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show the motivation and confidence Saeng has after her experience with the plant. there are many reasons and examples that support this. One reason is, he want to show the change in Saeng after he first test and when she boaght the flower to releive her. For example, after she failed the driving test, Saeng goes to the Florist. When she see this plant, he childhood comes back and she forgets her test. This flower motivates her to get her lisence. Another reason is, it shows how confident this experience has made her. For example, after failing, she comes back saying,” ... I will take the test again.” In conclusion, the author includes this paragraph to show how confident Saeng has become over her experience.
2	The author concludes that statement at  the story at the end of the story because he wants to show that Saeng wont give up just like the hibiscus.For example the hibiscus does its  best to survive in the winter and blooms and starts over in the spring.Saeng will also survive the winter and star all over again in the spring and retake the test. The author  wanted  to  show  the readers that Saeng is the hibiscus in a way that she has to start over and retry what she has failed as if the hibiscus had died in the winter.
0	My response is that if is about winter so realy it is going to be about witer walking around having fun and all them thing.
1	The author concludes the story like that to make the reader more intrested and to understand it will all happen again and again year after year. 
1	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because he wants to show that the flower was her inspiration to take the test before. The way I got my response was, throughout the story, @PERSON1 was always either gardening the hibiscus or had one. This obviously showed me that she was inspired by this flower and its beuty. In conclusion, the author ends the story like this to show the importance of the Hibiscus flower to Saeng.
2	The auther ends the story in this way because it represents the new brith that will take place. It’s almost as if she’s saying that she will hibernate during the winter, and when spring returns and everything begins a new cycle of life, then so will she. Saeng “realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through queit repitition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now.” She is saying that when the new season begins it will be her beginning and she’ll have a different outlook on her new life.
1	The author ends the story this way to wrap everything up. The author incorporated nature and descriptions of it. This was so the reader would get an image in their head of how “Beautiful or calming” spring supposively is.
1	I think that the author concludes the story with this paragraph because it suggest that her strength will come when the flowers come and she will be able to take the test.
1	In the story &quot;Winter Hibiscus,&quot; the author, Minfong Ho, concludes the story that paragraph because, she wants to show the determination the girl in the story possess. At first, the girl could not help herself and bought the expensive flower. She did not want her mother to be disappointed though, so she was determined to &quot;pass the test.&quot; In the spring when it is time to buy more seeds, the girl wants to be able to buy the seeds. So the author is showing the trait of determination that the girl controls.
8	Dear @CAPS1, I strongly believe computers have positive effects on people and the society. My reasons are you can learn and find new information on anything, you are able to talk to people faraway and computers teach skills to use in the future. I will now like to elaborate my reasons further. First of all, going on the internet and search sites help you learn and find information on anything you want. On the internet you can even ask questions, and they will probably be answered. You my even use information on the computer for a report statistics show @PERCENT1 of people who do reports, find their facts on the internet. Google, yahoo, and other search sites have helped children become more intrested in learning. Also, using a computer ables you to talk to other people from faraway places or friends you have not seen in a while. You can even webcam with people. I remember a few weeks ago, my best friend moved to florida, and now we webchat everyday! Talking online will even lower your telephone bills. Chatting online doesn't lost anything, where as the telephone charges for out of country calls cost . Computers will let you talk with your best buddy and save money. Last but not least, computers teach skills that can be applied later in life. Today many jobs in due using a computer, and technology is getting mom advanced. Before you know it will have to know how to work a computer. Also, you probably will need a computer in college. Proffesor @CAPS2 even stated, &quot;every single kid in my courses have some sort of computer.&quot; In college you will take notes and do assignments. Using computers will help you do this and make your life easier. As you can see i believe computers help people and society greatly. My reasons are you can learn and find information on anything, you are able to talk to other people who are faraway, and computer skills will help you in life. Technology is advancing and were going to have to use a computer sooner or later.
2	The author concludes the story with When they come back, saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the shows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again” because the hibiscus budding would symbolize starting over and Saeng taking the test again is giving her a chance to start over fresh and try again. The hibiscus doesn’t stop budding so Saeng shouldn’t stop trying!
3	In the last paragraph of the story, the author concludes the story like that because the author means to say that the hibiscus is the symbol of overcoming obstacles. For example, @CAPS1 mother says “Its flowers aren’t pretty, but it’s strong enough to make it through the cold months.” This is a symbol to overcome obstacles as a flower is strong enough to make it through the cold months, in which the weather is rough. In Saeng’s case, she is a girl who will make it in a foreign country. Thus, in the last paragraph, when Saeng vows silently to herself that she will take the drivers test again when the snow melts (writers over) and the hibiscus is budding, she uses the hibiscus as a symbol of overcoming the obstacle of failing the test. That is why the author decided to end the story with that last paragraph. 
2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because he wanted to convey a sense of determination of Saeng wanting to comput what she started. She had failed the drivers test and is very disappointed, for example, she starts to cry and has “tear stains and puffy eyes” as she remembers her homeland in Vietnam, her life, her memories, her family etc. She can relate to the geese that migrate during the winter and return again, an as new begginings start in the spring, so would she. A fresh start like the blossoming hibiscus. A fresh start with the drivers test.
1	The author concludes this story with this paragraph to show the aduiance that Saeng @CAPS1 gave up so you should'nt either. I think that this paragraph is describin a law of life witch is “@CAPS1 give up.” @CAPS2 even though she had failed at first she is still willing to try again.
0	When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt &amp;the geese return &amp; this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again. I think the author included this in the story to show that you shouldnt push things off. You should always deal wi them as they come up. So in the story the girl is showing a bad example. I believe the author wanted to make a point of not doing that. Overall, to add this phrase in this story was the right thing to do to try and show the right way of doing and going about these certain things
0	She should and needs too learn that you can’t replace a plant with the same thing and expect it too be as equal too it. She needs too learn that lesson in life.
3	The author ends the story with this paragraph to show that Saeng will follow  nature  and  try to  fit  into her  new  land. Saeng  has failed  her  driver’s   test  and  feels  out  of place  in  her  new home. The text states, “As  Saebba  nedae  tall  and  lush. And  surrounded  there  garden” (No 1).When  she  sees  the @CAPS1 it reminds her of old home where she fit in.Now she  wants to wait to see  that flower  grown  so when she takes the driver’s test again.Also,she sees geese fly over her head when she plants he r flower. The  author  writes. ”…She  realized  that  many  of  the  things that she had thought strange before  had become…almost  familiar  to  her how”(No @NUM1).The geese coming back in the spring will now  also  remind her  of  her  new  name  and  how  must  try  to  live  there happily now. In the last paragraph the  author writes,” I will take that test again”(No @NUM1).This gives the feeling of Saeng  trying to start a  new  beginning in this new home.  
2	This is a powerful sentence that demonstrates themes in the story. Saeng is determined to try again because she has been comforted by symbol of her homeland. This sentence shows what the plant has done for Saeng’s spirit and shows how that symbol helps heal her. The sentence is able to wrap up the story and demonstrates the importance of the hibiscus. In the story @CAPS1 describes the plant as a friend and remmeder of her homeland. Once she sees the plant in bloom she`ll know that she can take the test again. The paragraph is a great conclusion to the passage because it summarizes everything that the hibiscus has meant for Saeng.
1	I think the author is just trying to show that you never give up. I think the author is trying to show the beautie of nature. The author used that because in the story Saeng failed the test but at the end it says that she will take the test again. In the story it talks about the winter hibiscus that she planted and that is concluded in the conclusion. The conclusion basiclly saying is there will be a new beginning.
0	The author concluded the story with the paragraph “When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hisbiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,” because the paragraph its self concluded already. It basically sumed up what she was going to do all over again next time because she had already done it. What the author means by this paragraph is that when the plants come back in the spring she is going to have to do all the work again which was basically the test.
9	Dear Local Newspaper @CAPS1, Are computers really as great as they seem? It seems to me that they are used way too much in people's lives, and that computers are distractions that don't allow people to di ceratin things in their life that they would if they weren't always on the computer. People's lives are starting to revolve around going on the computer, checking your facebook, and looking at new videos on @CAPS2.com. I know from experience facebook or myspace can be very addicting. I'll spend hours commenting on pictures or new wall posts, and then at @NUM1 pm I've realized I haven't begun any of my loads of homework. This happens quite often, and I end up staying awake until around @NUM2. The following moring I wake up at @NUM3 am, exhausted. I am not exaggerating either, this happens to many of my friends, and if you have kids, ask them because I am @PERCENT1 sure they are on facebook or @CAPS3 all night. This doesn't just happen with kids either, my mom just got a facebook and she is hooked to it, even more than I am. Sometimes it can be come a competition to see who has the most pictures, or the most friends. Kids start adding people as friends that they don't even know computers aren't just distractions, they are also very dangerous. At my school we had assembly where they showed us how easy it was to find out someone's personal information, Even if you don't have your address or your phone number listed, there are many other ways to track you down. If you take a picture right after you won the championship soccer game, in your jersey. Just that one picture shows your team name, your last name, and your number. Anyone could easily search all that stuff on the internet and know exactly where your next game be. As the local newspaper @CAPS1, I am sure you must be concerned about the safety of the town, or even your own kids. Some people @MONTH1 say &quot;that would never happen to me&quot; but it easily could, especially if you're constantly on your computer. I have noticed that a lot of teens around my age are starting to become obsessed with being on the computer. A lot of times in families, instead of spending time together. syblings are fighting over who gets to go on the computer. One sybling @MONTH1 need it for homework, while the other just wants to talk to her friends on @CAPS3 and each believes they deserves the computer. Computers are starting to interest a lot with people's lives, in a negative way. Once again they are distracting, dangerous and hurt families. Computers hurt society more than it helps. And maybe you should look into how much time your kids are spending on the computer. 
1	I think the author concludes the story with this paragraph to let the readers know that she doesnt give up. They @MONTH1 have thought that she thaght the test back home were more important. So she wouldnt care about passing this test because she misses her home and wouldnt care about those test.
0	I think that the auther end the story Like that as a meterphor For people to think out side the @CAPS1 or thing. OR The auther might oF ended it Like that so people can get a picture in the head about what she was talking about.
2	The reason why the author concludes the story with this paragraph is to give You an idea of how she feels about what happened to her. This paragraph is her telling herself that everything is ok and she going to do better next time. The author concluded the story with this paragraph to make Saeng sound more confident in herself. In the middle of the story when she was having the conversation with her mother, she sounded unconfident with herself so this paragraph made her sound like she was sure with herself, like she knew what she was going to do.
2	In the story “Winter Hibiscus”, I think that the author concludes the story in “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is dudding, then I will take that test again” because she has made Saeng feel that if that hibiscus can restart and make new flowers the Saeng should do the same. Therefore thats why the author added that quet to the end of the story
2	Saeng failed her driver’s test at the beginning of the story. She finds a hibiscus plant and buys it because it reminds her of her life in Vietnam. She sates, “The familiar fragrance filled her lungs and Saeng could almost feel the light strands of her grandmother’s long grey hair.” The flower reminds her of her grandmother. The mother says, “??? Seen this kind blooming along the lake, it’s flowers aren’t as pretty, but it’s strong enough to make through the cold months.” She’s trying to make her daughter feel better. It states, “Overhead, a flock of Canada geese flew by their fault honks clear and yes-familiar to Saeng now. She realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become almost familiar to her now.”
1	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because at the end she realizes that the things that seemed strange before she had just realized as the seasons were changing and the plants. So the author put that paragraph at the end because in the spring she goes back to school to take the test again
1	The author concludes the story the way he or she dose because it shows that the time she found the plant that she will get her lisens So it is a reminder for her. I also think she did it that way because when the plant blooms it starts over and so when she sets on gose to take a chance at the test she is starting new
2	The author ends the story with that paragraph because she wants to show that the peace that the peace that the flower gave will build her confidence and she will not give up. I know this because in the story the main character fails her driving test and when she sees the flower it helps remind her of the home she had in Vietnam. Another reason is because the flower blooms in spring and it never stops blooming. She knows it will never give up and she relaizes that she shouldn’t either. Plus the plant gives her stength to try again. So the reason the author ends her story with that paragraph is to show the power the flower that was know to her, give her and how she will no give up.
0	The author concludes the story with this ending paragraph because. It combine the two inpefect situations. When she said when they come back Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring when the snow melt and the gese return and this hibiscus is budding then I will take test again. She will prove her point and abbreviated the situation.
0	The author is saying that she would take the test again in the spring instead of the winter cause she would be more focus to just keep her mind on the test &amp; not the planting.
7	Dear @LOCATION1 news paper, I think computers are a bad and good thing because computers keep some people inside more than usual and then on the other hand a computer allows you to talk with family members that you haven't seen in a long time, search for upcoming events and see if they are canceled and to search up other stuff like when a movie is playing. Computers are a big part of school too, because without computers it would be hard to study and for some teachers most of their homeworks aquires you to use a computer. There is some other things that are bad about computers too for example: my friend stayed on his computer playing video games for most of the day. Its like when he's on that computer he dosen't listen or hear anyone, not even his parents. He barely goes down to eat dinner and when he does he has his laptop right beside him. His parents started to get tired of it so they took his tv and laptop away so he could go outside and play with his friends. After a while he started to come outside a lot mostly every day when it was nice. They gave him back his computer and tv. The only time he goes on it now is rainy days.
1	I think she ended the story with that because throout the wole story she trys to work hard. And this last sentence is saying that its not over, That she will be back to take the test again. She trys to prove herself during the whole book. And she will continue working hard to get what she wants  
2	In the story the author concludes the story the way she did because it is metaphoric, I say this because she is comporing herself to the hibiscus plant. As a hibiscus would be tested to over come conditions such as the cold and forexample in the test the author states “ its flowers arent as pretty, but its strong enough to make it through the cold months here. This winter hibiscus”. She as the hibiscus will bloom again and have to pass the test of surviving the cold, will be able to have a chance to pass her own test, that is why the author concludes the story as she did.
3	The concluding paragraph in the story “Winter Hibiscus “portrays the powerful massage of change from a cold, distant failure to adapt, to a new life. Saeng relates her transformation to the changing seasons from winter to spring . this is obvious shown it states  “in the spring , when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding . she accepts this as a new chance to start fresh , and then try to pass the test. The change from winter  to spring symbolize saeng’s hardship  of flying to adapt to her new home. And then, as the geese   return and the hibiscus is  adapting in its new environment is the symbol by which saeng  follows as it is from her old home in Vietnam, but can now  also prosper elsewhere. 
2	 The  author concludes with this because it had the most impact. The ending also gave the most meaning. The meaning of the last paragraph is that time will help her adjust to where she is now living. It also incorporates the hibiscus flower and how it will bloom again, this could have a double meaning, and mean that the authors life will bloom again. Overall it was a good way to conclude the paragraph.
2	In the story “Winter Hibiscus&quot; I believe they end the story the way they did, “when they come back, saeng vowed silently to herself, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again” because with saeng making a goal, she’s overcoming her disappointment and uncomfort living in a new country. The archetyple meaning of a flower bud is: prosper, new, growth. This shows he growing and that’s important in life and that’s why the ended it the way they did. It’s a positive ending.
3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it shows that she realizes her connection to the hibiscus plant. All through the story Saeng thinks about native plants she’s seen before are now in @LOCATION1. She sees how they’re adapted to life there, like in the way the hibiscus can survive the winter. Saeng realizes that she also must adapt in her new home. She doesn’t necessarily need to adapt to survive, but to be successful. She vows that in the spring, when the hibiscus is budding (restarting its growth cycle) she will restart too and retake the test.
2	In the story, “Winter Hibiscus,” by Minfong Ho, the author’s final paragraph shows how much the hibiscus means to her. The author uses symbolism when, he talks about the hibiscus because it is a strong plant just like the girl needs to be to pass the driving test. The author put the paragraph at the end to show that if the hibiscus can come back, after winter, so can the girl. In conclusion, the author used the last paragraph to emphasize the meaning of the hibiscus.
3	The story is full of emotion and homesickness that it can be a bit depressing, so the author wanted to end with message of hope. After saeng failed the test “in the maint shelter of the greenhouse (she) broke down and wept,” it’s inspiring to know that she’ll keep tryinh despite all her hardship. I know first hand that homesickness can be pretty bad, and finding the strength to keep going and make the promise” to take that test again” can be very hard but worthwhile .  The author also used the ending to give another meaning to the hibiscus for “when the geese return  and the hibiscus is blooming “ when the winter is over hard times are past, there will be new hope in a new, beautiful spring. 
1	The reason why the author concluded the story with that paragraph was because at basically explained everything You needed to know for the ending. It basically explains that she is willing to take the time to study for the test she had previously taken and did not pass and wants to take it again once spring arrives. For example, the geese had left for the winter. and once they return in the spring, she will take the test over again, in conclusion, the author concludes the story with this paragraph because it best explains the ending of the story.
1	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show the growth or hope that Saeng has that she will be comfortable in the United States. When she said â€œI-I failed the test,â€ I took it as failing the test to see if she got over her country and if   
11	Dear Newspaper @CAPS1, @CAPS2, more and more people in our proud and courageous country of @LOCATION1 have been. Computers were mode to simply difficult situations, such as typing, finding, , and keeping a record of financial statuses. Despite the main uses, many @CAPS3 citizens have been using the computer for that are neccessary which result in a loss of to living a healthy, social, life. these are exercisem and spending line with fellow people indicating family and friends. as a result, please read on so that you, the @CAPS4 our can understand why computers have became out of hand and relay my message to the readers of your. One much life is exercise, and due to the of modern computers, exercise is the key to a healthy life. Personally, I know at least poor young children in my very school that are a victim of the cruel disease, known as obesity. The reason for the dese children is quite simple-they over use, and forget the natural bounderies to using something. Practically every day, each of the foor heart- children begin to their computers from the second will home, to the moment they fall asleep. this outrageous number of hours the vital the to exercise, therefore allows their bodies to adopt to the habits of the children sleep, eat, computer. This upselling manor of the foor kids enables others to pick on them for being fat, yet they can't fight back, they have what so ever, thus the over use of computers can result in a over weight child, with no exercise, and no power/ muscle to depend themselves from. Another reason whay computers are thinking such a @LOCATION1's youth, is because of less than medicine usage of. Everyday I chose to walk from school, for the breathly sounds of type of wheather day should I hope you I @CAPS5, spending time with your friend and family yet ones again people who abuse see the importance of this. Around two years ago, I was on the computer non-stop, @CAPS6, playing video games, and all sorts of computer-released activities. every day, constantly, for about a year, I came home, to on the computer, and began my , as I @LOCATION2. This resulted loosing the time I had with my mosue. Furthermore, if I needed is contact @MONTH1 friends, I just @CAPS7 them, rather than speaking in person,. Over line both my family and friends and grow of this electronic device, called the computer luckily, @ORGANIZATION1 nothing like that now however, I hope that you see the side to the computer, and how loosing your family and friends possibly. In conclusion, @ORGANIZATION1 guarantee that with all the information about how are out. Hopefully you will the paper of @CAPS1 of our newspaper and demand a column about computer loose the valuable time for exercise, nature, and family &amp; friends. Thank you for letter, and I will an article relative to this subject.
0	In the story ’’winter hibiscus by Minfong Ho, I think the author concludes the story with this paragraph. &quot;When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding then I will take that test again.’’ @CAPS1 is shows that you should fight. For whats right and what you belive in.
2	Saeng wanted to show that she was strong and determined. She wanted to make the best of things with what she had. She had lost a lot of hope with the big move to another country. The winter made her sad longing even more for home. She bought the flower to, in a sence, bring her back home. When the spring comes, she will bud with the flower and take the test again. This is her new home with new hibiscus. After all, winter is no time for a flower.
1	Saeng did get the feel that she called fil in and. Buying something that could help her but also have her missing were she from. And with her mother get a little mad about it because the prags she pay for. It @CAPS1 vowed silently to herself in the spring that she take the test again.
1	The author concludes the story with this paragraph. I think the author concludes this story with that paragraph to show that Saeng has confidence to take the driving test.
1	 The author leaves the story there because it keeps you guessing on what is going to happen. That is really all you need to know about the story. The important parts the author has told al ready &amp; the future is a whole different story. It doesn’t matter if Saeng passes the test or what happens over the winter. The author has told us everything to know about the importance of this person &amp; her mother
2	Saeng feels out of place in her new home and new country. She vows silently that in a year she will take the test again. She vows that in a year she will be used to her new home and new country and will start to enjoy life again. The author concluded with this paragraph because the girl Saeng will hopefully enjoy her new home and in a year she will be used to what happens in her new country. Saeng just feels out of place and she wants to wait a while until she tries to retake the test. The author concludes the story with that paragraph because she made a vow to herself and hopefully she will keep the vow and make it happen.
2	The author might of concluded the story with this paragraph to show that Saeng isnt @CAPS1 to stop trying shes @CAPS1 to work harder. As she sees the Geese adapting she chooses to try. and make their wew home work out. After they disapear she picks herself up and says that shes @CAPS1 to try again. By doing this she is commiting herself to try @CAPS2 things t adapt to changes.
1	I think she ends the story with this paragraph because she wants to take the test in the @DATE1 time when it won’t be so hard on her. It will be warm again and it’s not quite as cold.
1	The story concludes with this paragraph for a number of reasons. First, in the spring it is warm and sunny and this helped to end the story in a happy note. Next this shows that Saeng can adapt to her new home, as the hibiscus will through winter. Finally, it shows Saeng is determined and won't let her mother down. That is why the story concludes with that paragraph.
2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show if they can adapt then she can too. “In the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again. “I choose this saying because it shows you if they are able to come back after everything that has happen she can to. She should be able to adapt to a new place just like they do.
11	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I am a child of the tech generation, or the generation in which technology has taken on a new meaning. That meaning is life. Our life revolves around technology in general as the @LOCATION3 revolves around the sun. The chief technological preference, computers, is greatly beneficial, aren’t as bad as many people speculate, and help us live and prosper in this struggling world. Look, if you want to roast computers then by all means, roast away. But if you do so without first regarding all the angles of them, then you, my friend, have absolutely no standing on the situation. You could say that they are a neucence but could never have used aho. You could argue that they can be used to detonate bombs, but, lets be practical, how many normal people actually wake upwake up and point out the drearyness of life and then type in a command to detonate a bomb? A serious benefit you have obviously choes t o overlook is the invaluable information it aptly places in front of you on a @NUM1 inch screen. You can read book reviews, read books, bag things, and get the cutting-edge news you want, to name just a meager amount of possible strengths. Further more, not everything that you speculate as bad has to be bad just because you say it so. When you think of @CAPS3. Do you always think about vulgar, inappropriate pictures, and illegal images? That’s funny, because @CAPS3 keeps family in touch, gives people things to do, and keeps friends in different states on the same server. Youtube is not all swearing and bad videos. My family casts actors for shows, and one way they know what an actor is capable of is by going to their channel and looking at the videos that they have created. My mother actually contacts actors in videos to see if they want to become professionals. That is the business, finding talent where it is seldom found. Lastly, did you even think about the fact that computers are used to start companys and saves lives? You probably didn’t even know that, from a computer, astrologists monitor images of the universe captured by the hubble space carrier meteorologists track cloud formations from satellites using a computer. Maybe you didn’t choose to say that surgeons can dictate operations from their office in @LOCATION1 on a patient in @LOCATION2? You didn’t even say that seismologist use computers to traet the shifting of the tectonic plates to see where the epicenter of a major earthquake is? You just didn’t know. So, let’s face it, computers are important. You probably used to do what little research you did them. In fact, pardon me. You probably didn’t do the research in the first place, instead pointing fingers at the innocent. Smooth move, buddy.
2	Authors often end stories with paragraph that make readers wonder what happens next. In Winter Hibiscus by: Minfong Ho there is an ending paragraph just like that. The author ends it like this because she is looking towards the future. She says that she will take the test when the snow melts, the gesse come back, and the hibiscus bluming. She is looking at it like that is a new beggining. She wants to start over. Also the gesse, blooming hibiscus, and melted show gives her hope that she will pass her test. She belives now they have a hibiscus maybe it will be more like where she use to live. Authors use endings that make people wonder so people think. 
0	The response that the author concludes the story with this peragraph because  the author wanted us that read the story to understanding what was going on in the story. like for the @CAPS1 they was sayin when they come back Saeng vowed silently to herself in the spring when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibicus is budding then I will take that test again, was tryin to see where everybody head at in the story so they can understanding what the author be talkin about.
2	The author concludes the story with the paragraph because the geese and the hibiscus were both things that were familiar to Saeng They remind her of her homeland,When  the familiar things return ,she will have the strength to the test again and hopefully do better.The narrator says “Overhead a of Canada geese flew by,their faint hunks clear and –yes-fimiliar to Saeng now “.This shows how the geese are a symbol of the fimilar things from her homeland that help Saeng feel more comfortable in her new home.
1	The author included that paragraph because the hibiscus plant makes her think of where she is from and helps her to succeed a certain things. I know that the hibiscus is from her homeland because in the story she says “I mean, not like the kind we had at–at-”, she found that she was still to shaky to say the words at home.” She misses being home and this plant helps her bring back memorys of being there. Therefore the author included that paragraph to show the reader that she misses her homeland.
1	The author concludes the story with this paragraph why @CAPS1 it might be important to the author about Saeng. It some thing personely about her past or where she had came for. She trying to say that when she come back in the spring she going to take the test again in school. OR She is going to plants something over again the spring @CAPS1. As snow @CAPS2 and its too cold to plant any thing. That where she came from is really important to her and she miss it and went to go back to where she Come from. 
1	The author concludes this story with “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, whe the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is building, then I will take the test again&quot;. She does this because in the story this plant has given her a lot of beilef in herself to @MONTH1 be do better in the future.
2	The author concludes the story this ways for a few reasons. One reason is that she will have more experience with her new country. She only left her homeland a few months before so in about six more months she will be more knowledgable about the ways of the new country. This will make her more capable of passing the @CAPS1 Ed test. Also in the spring is when the flower will be beautiful again and this will give her new-found strength that will cause her to pass. The few months time will allow the author time to mentally and physically prepare for the exam. Mentally, she will be able to study and learn all she needs to know. And physically she will age which will also teach her new things.
2	In order to get over her failure, Saeng bought a flower that reminded her of home. Saeng’s started to cry when she bought the flower. She wanted to be back home. The author concluded the story with this paragraph to show how she will take the test when she feels like she is at home. “when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,” Saeng said to herself. Those things make her feel welcome and feeling that way will help her with her test. The paragraph concludes the story with all the things she is comfertable with. This conclusion helps the reader understand what reminds her of home. Also explains how much the hibiscus flower ment to her. Buying the flower helps her with her troubles. Seeing the geese fly reminds her of her home. The author concludes the story with the memories that will help Saeng in the future.
1	I think the author ended this story with this conclusion because, every one should have fresh starts, or second chances. I guess the author was leaving in a message stating if you fail once you should at least try again. When Saeng failed the test it seems as though her self-esteem lowered, and her mother tried cheering her up, and eventually she realized it will be bad giving up and not trying again with a fresh start.
3	Minfong Ho included the last paragraph in the story because it alluded to the fact that saeng felt better and more confident when reminded of home. when saeng saw the hibiscus she got a feeling &quot;so intense, it was almost visceral.” The flower was creatively used by Ho. She said that the winter hibiscus is strong enough to make it through the cold months, which made the reader think after reading the last paragraph, that this flower must give saeng hope and confidence. Also, the geese make a V which I infured would mean Vietnam to saeng which is what the author is trying to get her reader to think. That is why “and the geese return.” is mentioned in the last paragraph. Minfong Ho wants her readers to realize that objects that make us more comfortable and happy are what make us strong and confident in the end. The author did a great job placing that last thought into the last paragraph because it perfectly sums up the lesson, and that is that you should do things when you feel confident and it feels like home to you. You @MONTH1 be small and fragile, but if you “plant” yourself you can thrive with confidence. 
6	I think having a computer is good because you can research stuff and you can meet people and chat with them. Computers are important to society because it helps keep track of info like doctor appointments and crimnal records for police to follow by. having a computer is a good but if you spend to much time on it you will hurt you eyes. Having a computer can help you talk to friends who have moved and have website that they can talk to you on like myspce or facebook or even yahoo chat. When having a computer its very helpful in life and can help you in a lot of areas. Computers can also cause problems like spending to much time on it and not getting enough sleep for school. Having a computer can also be bad because sitting to close or spending to much time can hurt your eyes and cause you to wear glasses. The way i look at it as i see is that to much is bad so i think spending some time on it is good do you agree?
1	The last paragraph at the end of the story was the authors way of showing how Saeng wanted spring to come early because she wants to see her hibiscus. If spring doesn’t come fast she will not get to see her hibiscus and the snow won’t melt. When Saeng comes up she hopes she can take the test.
2	The author concludes the story with the sentence &quot;When they come back, saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again. &quot;because that winter hibiscus symbolizes a new beginning for her. For example back in her home town she had hibiscus's and everything was fine and normal, she lived her life and so on, well then she moved to the u.s, and she didn’t have any hibiscus, she just failed her driving test, she feels miss placed, and doesnt fit in. So, when she saw that winter hibiscus she felt as if she found something to help her feel at home or at ease almost. She felt a sense of security In conclusion the author ended with that sentence because its a new beginning for her and that hibiscus means a new start.
2	The reason why the author concludes the story with this paragraph is because it resembles to her own life, that she will have another chance, just as geese will come back again. The reason why the last part resembles back to her life is that it says in the spring, spring is usually a good time of year because it gets warmer towards @DATE2 and Flowers come back. The hibiscus plant will bloom again and that will renew, In a way, her warming thought of her old home. Then that will be the time to retake her driving test that she failed, which was before she bought the plant. The author added this last part because it tied and matched so well with the story.
0	The reason why the author concludes the store with on small paragraph is because some time the little things count the most and the authore thouth t that in two setses that he could summarz the most important things in the story and I think that the author did a great job.
1	The author concludes with with paragraph because Saeng has to take the test all over. She @MONTH1 think theres a better chance when it blooms and the snow melts. So that is when Saeng is going to try and take the test after the snow melts and the hibiscus blooms
1	The author concludes with this sentence for a couple reasons. Saeng feels that she can’t do it until the spring because that when the geese come back. Also that is when the hibiscus buds. In a way she feels as though she will blossom in spring and be able to pass the test.
0	I think that the authoR includes this paRagRaph in this stoRy b/c the gRandmothER might think that it is a tEst to sEE what she can gEt donE @CAPS1 time. The gRandmotheR might gEt more done then should @CAPS2.
2	I think that the author concludes the story like that because @MONTH1 be she’s saying that by that time she’ll be ready to take the test again. Another way of thinking is that @MONTH1 be by that time when that happens in spring she would be preprared and more confident of herself. @MONTH1 be the author was trying to say that just like the begining of a new springs, it would be a new beginning for her.
1	I think that the author concludes the story with that paragraph because Saeng is saying that she will try again. For example, despite failing her driving test she decides to take it over after having the experience of planting with her mother. It seems as if planting the hibiscus has gained her some confidence in striving to succeed once again. In the story it seemed that she was getting used to planting. For example, now that she has done something and accomplished that she knows that she can take the test again and accomplished that. In conclusion, that is why I think the author concluded with that paragraph.
2	The author concludes the story with a statement that makes you think because she wants to emphasize the relationship between Saeng and the hibiscus. Just like Saeng, the hibiscus is in a new environment and has to adapt to the surroundings. Saeng had just failed her driving test so shes bummed about that. The concluding sentance makes you realize that Saeng can overcome her driving challenges if the plant can overcome the harsh surroundings.
8	Dear Newspaper people, I'm here to tell you that computers have a bad effect on people. The computer @MONTH1 hold lots of information but does it always hold the right information? You could do lots of other stuff than lay on the computer. Also, the computer is very distracting. The computer @MONTH1 give you the wrong info. Instead of going through the process of turning on your computer, search for the info and turn it off takes more time than find a book, open it, find the info close it and put it back. Books more often are correct. Computers take time to find into than a book. Computers give you too much information than a book. There's plenty of other stuff to do than play on the computer. You could read a book or draw. You could also play outside and shoot hoops or ride your bike. You can call up your friends and play with them. If you're really bored and you don't know what to do, make up a game. At times, computers could distract you. If you want to get homework done and you have a computer, it gets you off topic. If you're at work with a computer, it's tempting. Even other people on computers is distracting. if you're working on the computer, it does not take much to to take the thing you need to search like @ORGANIZATION1 and change it to something you want to search like @ORGANIZATION1 company. See what I mean by a negative effect? It doesn't give you the right info always, you could do better things in life and is very distracting. It is what makes the workers to the procrastinators and the fit to the lazy. Computers have entered our world and have altered all of our lives! Computers have made a big change to everyday life. Please agree with me.
8	Dear local newspaper, I disagree because it would give kids, children to do negative thing like being rude, not listening, being loud, not doing homework just because your on the computers. Please listen to why I disagree here are some reason why. I know when i am on the computer my mom every @NUM1 mins what you own because there nasty things on that computers that kids, children be looking at you never now they could learn how to kill someone just being on the computer. I know when I go on that computer I am rude and disrespectful because when I am on you can tell me nothing because I was into the computer my attention move to the computer. Thats why they should have @CAPS1 computers because it takes the attention. I don't listen while I am on the computer my mom tell's me to get on &quot; I will say &quot;@CAPS1&quot; I am doing some thing she will tell me to get off i @CAPS1 leave me alone because I am on the computer and because I am focus on the computer. And I have the computer loud so @CAPS1 one could get my attention so I have the computer allways loud because my main focus was the computer than I'll do whatever later. O and I don't even remember what be happend when I get on the computer. Not doing your school. I know I be telling my mom let me use the computer so I could do my school work and I be getting on different things instead f doing my homework my mom be like t through you were doing you homework and say &quot;I did finish my homework when I know I did not finish my homework but I only say it because my focus was on the ocmputer. These are reason why the society should take back the computer. I hope you undertand the reasons I give you because the society should really stop giving out the computers in the first place. If you have a daughter or a son and know they have said some of thease things now you know you children have been and always lied to you. Know I could olny the computer for @NUM2 min each day. So yes take them away.
1	the author includes this as the last paragraph because it could give Saeng’s mother hope. It could give hope because they could really need Saeng to pass the test.
3	It was very important that the author concluded the story with that paragraph. It reastablished the meaning of the hibiscus and why it was important to Saeng. I showed the determination she had in overcoming her problems with living in a new place. Without this paragraph we would have been left assuming what was to come of Saeng. In some stories it would have worked but in this case it was needed. When she first saw the hibiscus she broke down becaus she could not remember her home land. This is why the hibiscus is so important to the story. By restating the importance of it in the end helped the reader follow what was to come next eventhough the story had come to an end. It was important to express this again. In the last paragraph is says, “This hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” The buds represent a new beginning for Saeng and a new chance to overcome her problems. This paragraph was very important and without it these events would be left hanging. The meaning of the story is much clear with it as a reader.
3	Including the bit about taking the test again when the “hidiscus is budding” provides a sense of closeur and lesson to an otherwise open ending. Saeng fails the drivers test early in the story, then on her way home she buys a hibiscus. The reader really doesn’t see a connection until this last paragraph. The hibiscus represents perserverence and strength. After a harsh winter this hibiscus can bloom again and ard continue to live. Even after moving from Vietnam, and struggling to adapt, Saeng must recover, ard keep trying. Just like the flower blooming again, so will Saeng. She will take the test a second time and pass. She will adapt to her environment, and keep going, just like the hibiscus.
2	The  author concludes  the  story  with  the  paragraph  ‘ When  they  come  back  ,  Saeng  vowed  silently  to  herself  in  the  spring  ,  when  the   snow  melt  and  the  geese  return  and  this  hibiscus  is  budding  ,  the  I  will  take  the   test  again ,”  because  the  author  started  out  the  story  after  Saeng  failed  her  driving  test  .  Saeng  is  reminded  from  the  Hibiscus  about  her  homeland.  After  Saeng  wanted  the  Hibiscus  in  the  garden  ,”  a  flock  it  canada geese  flow by “,  as  they  flew  by  Saeng  felt  a  sign  at  comfort  and  vowed  to  herself  what  started  everything  .  If  Saeng  did  pass  the  driving  test  then  she  would  of  never  found  the  Hibiscus.
0	The author include it because her mother took the test and passed it and the daughter wanted to do the same Just like her mom. And she can only take it in the spring because there is no flowers out in the winter.
2	In think the author is trying to show that Saeng is finally starting to accept and get over the struggles in the life. It is showing that she has finally gotten used to @LOCATION1 and the customs, but she still hasn’t forgotten her heritage. “But she had herself much preferred it to a big Mac.” It also proves that she is going to be positive and not let disc overage her. She’s going to retake it and try again. During the beginning look on her situations in life. But after visiting the floral shop, she discovers a more cherry. Optimistic outlook on her situation and decides to do something about it.
0	I think the author concludes the story with that paragraph for many reasons. One reason I think is because she’s concluding that the winter is there, and when winter is over, she is going to start flowering and planting again. In the story it said, “the winter hibiscus was in the ground now,….” So, now she has to wait for winter to pass by then the hibiscus will be starting to grow and will hopefully be alone by spring. So, that is why I think she concluded the story the way she did.
2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because the question of what about her test? Needed to be answered and that’s when she'd to comfortable to take it. In the text. To her, the plant felt smooth and cool just as she had known it, which was comforting. She closed her palm around it and held it tight. That, at least, she could hold on to. Unlike her grandmother, she felt a wave of loss so deep and strong that it stung her eyes, with sadness, and maybe disapointment, which she probably word want to deal with for a while, hinted at in the conclusion her mother even uttered a small cry of surprise and delight to see the flower, even before being shocked when Saeng reveals she paid all of over nineteen dollars for it. With this concluding paragraph, I believe that she will be more comfortable at the time. planned because she'll have new and old things to come home to, such as the geese and plant.                
0	In the story “Winter Hibiscus” the author includes this ending paragraph because she wants to show that next time around she will be prepared and ready for the garden and the challenges it holds. This first time, she wasn’t ready, and she didn’t know about the winter hisbiscus because she never did anything like it before.
1	In the story “Winter Hibiscus” the story ends with saying “in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again” The reason the author ends the story like that is because it showing that eves though she @MONTH1 of failed the test once shes not going to give up just because of as adjustment change. The Hibiscus made the reader relize that a plantation where she lives can adapt so can she. 
12	@ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1 computers benefit our society has been a hotly debated topic among citizens in our town. Many argue that computers provide quick easy communication, help children and adults learn, and even teach balancing habits to our generation. I firmly believe that computers are necessary in our society. @CAPS2, @CAPS3! I miss you!&quot; are the words @ORGANIZATION1 @NUM1-year-old @PERSON1. @PERSON1 has been working overseas for two years in @LOCATION2, @LOCATION3. One @ORGANIZATION1 the only ways she can contact her father is through @ORGANIZATION3. Communication is extremely important in our society; it brings families and friends closer together. Computers provide a variety @ORGANIZATION1 forms @ORGANIZATION1 communication, such as @ORGANIZATION3, @CAPS5, and instant messaging. &quot;@ORGANIZATION3&quot; allows people to have what can be called a &quot;visual phone conversation.&quot; A teary-eyed @PERSON2 says, &quot;@CAPS4 since @CAPS7 wife died, @CAPS7 daughter has been @CAPS7 only companion. With @ORGANIZATION3, I can not only hear her voice every day but see her face, too. It never fails to make me smile.&quot; @CAPS5 and instant messaging also give out society fast, easy communication with others. Invitations, announcements, and just a quick &quot;hello&quot; can all be done by @CAPS5. Therefore, computers are very important for communication in our society. Have you @CAPS4 seen the look on a child's face @CAPS10 he/she learns something new? Computers provide an excellent variety @ORGANIZATION1 education in our society. For example, toddlers and children can use programs such as @ORGANIZATION2 (@CAPS6). @CAPS6 programs teach reading, writing, and speaking to children. &quot;@CAPS7 child used @CAPS6 @CAPS10 he was a toddler,&quot; says @PERSON3, a @LOCATION1 resident, &quot;and now his teachers are so impressed by his reading and writing skills. I couldn't be more proud.&quot; Computers don't only teach children; they teach adults, too! Did you know that adults learn @PERCENT1 @ORGANIZATION1 their knowledge about the environment, politics, and other basic information from the computer? Computers are needed to help people learn in our society. Finally, computers teach balance. A @LOCATION1 mom says, &quot;@CAPS7 teenager @PERSON4 has learned how to balance computer and life, and I can definitely see how it connects to other areas @ORGANIZATION1 balance as well.&quot; @CAPS10 teenagers learn to balance their computer time, they also learn how to balance, extra-curricular activities in school. This shows, as a result, that students actually learn responsibility from computers. I hope that our society will consider the fact that computers are necessary. @CAPS10 they provide commonication, teach education, and help kids learn how to balance, what do we have to lose? Computers can most certainly improve our society.&quot;
1	The reason she ended the story like that is because when everything is blooming she will feel more at home and will have healthy. I say this because the girl used to help her grandma withe her hair before she moved. So if the flower is blooming then it would remind her of her grandma which would be insentive to do good on the test.
0	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it is a personification involving snow smelting, geese returning, and the hibiscus budding. It’s explaining moments in time. The author describes how isolated the hibiscus is.
1	The author ended the story with that paragraph because it’s telling how Saeng  feel about winter being near and how she have to wale  until spring come back around to do her teast again.  
0	Saeng cares about the flowers. She cares about the flower. Natural occurrence with them growing unique.
0	In the story I don’t know why the author and the story with that I really don’t know, maybe she was talking about she took all test now she wouldn’t take it over again atey. The times come. She in school and when one took the test of was that kind of wealth now that of not of is @DATE1 and school is over. 
0	Why the author concludes this paragraph into the story is because at the end off the story they needed and ending. Also why is because the picked and conclusion that would best fit this story.
3	I believe that the author chose to conclude the story the way they did because the story was about perserverance. For example, the story was baised around the winter hibscus plant. This is a good example because in the end Saeng vows that she will perserveer and take her test again and the hibiscus perserveers and forges through the winter not allowing itself to die. Another example that @CAPS1 mother worked outside while it was cold to get her gardening done. This relates to the story because her stayed out in the cold garden to get her job done, she could have quit and gone inside the nice warm house, just like Saeng could have quit and said she was not going to try to take her test agin. But she did not, she said she was going to try again. 
1	I  think  the  author  ended  this  story  like  that  because  it  means  that  she  hasent gave up yet and even though she failed the  first time she is come try again,” In the spring , when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding .” mean that when all is @CAPS1 .” She will try to do it again because if she passes it will be @CAPS1. The story was preety bad because I don’t even know what she  failed  so I didn’t  like it.
1	I think the reason why the author ended the story with this “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding. Then I will take that test again.” paragraph because like this the plant didn’t have a fight chance for survival in the winter and was same with the girl when she took her driving test but in spring the plant has chance bloom so she has a chance to pass the test because because there time and place for everything.
2	Emotion, camitmint, hope, all are reasons why the author ended the story with “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melt and the gees return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again.&quot; @CAPS1, that last paragraph shows that she has emotion. Next, It shows that she has comitmint, she says that when the hibiscus coms back she will take the test again. Lastly, it shows that there is hope and the she will try and redeam herself. These are all the reasons why she used the last paragraph.
9	Dear local newspaper committee...., I am writing to you, about how there is a substancial dilemma within the concern of computer use. From my data that I have collected, computers are both somewhat good, and bad. But I believe that there are more reasonable &quot;@CAPS1,&quot; toward computer use. In my opinion, I state that computers are quite addicting due to, addiction of computer, loss time of exercise, and how computers @MONTH1 &quot;help,&quot; one in obtaining the loss of their social enviorment. Computer @MONTH1 seem helpful but of @ORGANIZATION1 they are a great way to research for @ORGANIZATION1 reasons. But there is also the choice of books for research. Computer use has risen to a substancial crisis line, because they are addicting. An example is the well-known link called, &quot;@CAPS2,&quot; @CAPS2 is a place where you can socialize. But when your child has a @CAPS2, and they are on the computer doing &quot;homework,&quot; there is a @PERCENT1 that they will end upon @CAPS2, than rather doing their homework that important information was found at an @ORGANIZATION1 @DATE1. Computers are addicting also because of online computer games. Computer games online can be fun, but are a complete waste of time for you electrical bill, and @ORGANIZATION1 purposed of you child. Computers are very addicting in terms of @CAPS2, and online games. Computers are somewhat good, but are very to you health. Did you know that @PERCENT2 of @LOCATION1 has increased their weight, due to videogames and computer? Computers are horrible when it comes to this topic. Overtime, you begin to gain weight by spending more time using the computer and less time working out and staying fit. This also revolves around addiction, by using the computer over a large period of time. In the end, computers are a harzardous topic, when it comes to working out, and staying in shape. Computers are terrible and horrified when it comes to friends. Friends are people who spend time with you and interact with you. But computers see it a different way. by using computer for a long period of time, you begin to think how computers are all you need. Soon enough, your friends will leave you because you don't care about them, and forget them. This also revolves around addiction. By addiction, you lose your friends and you damage your social enviornment. Computer @MONTH1 seem &quot;fun,&quot; but are defuliated when it comes to friends. In the end, I beleive that computers are a waste, because they are addicting you become very unhealthy and they strive to damage your social enviornment. With the facts I have stated, they have supported my reasons. Computers are not the way to go. So, try books.
3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to emphasize her new found determination to overcome her obstacles. For example, in the passage she states, “she realized that many of the things she had thought strange before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiarizes to her.” At this point she has an epiphany, and realizes that life is like seasons. In the end paragraph she intercedes this by saying that in the spring she will take the test again. This shows that just as the winter hibiscus is along winter, and then blooms in the spring, she must be strong during these hard times. One day her time will come for her to “bloom.” @CAPS1 experiences hard times, but we all must be strong and steadfast as we wait for our time to “bloom.” 
1	The author concluded the story with that paragraph because, he wanted to show that she wasn’t going to give up just because she failed one time. She failed the test one time already. She was very sad about it. She went and bought a plant. Saeng’s mom told her that they were going to do it the right way. Saeng was crying when she told her mom about it. Her mom was very understanding thought. Her  mom could have been very mad with her. She could of used a plant that they grew. The plant @MONTH1 not grow right now. She should of bought a real plant from someone else.
3	Determined, new beginning, symbolism – each are reasons why I believe the author concluded the story with this paragraph. She finds new hope after buying the plant, and is newly determined to pass the test that she writes about. As she sees the geese flying overhead, she realizes what determination they must have and vows to do better on the test next year. With the new flower, she feels like shes starting over so that she’s able to pass this test that seems important to her. When the author write, “and the geese will return and this hibiscus in budding, then I will take that test again,” it shows symbolism. By telling about the flower blooming new buds, it symbolizes that Saeng wanted to turn over a new leaf of some sort. Determined, new beginning, symbolism – each are reasons why I think the author concluded the story with this paragraph.
3	The author of “ Winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho end the story with the statement, “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take test again,” because it showed that Saeng had overcome her problem and vowed to correct it. By ending with this statement the author showed that the beauty of nature can help one to overcome their problems, as did Saeng. Upon seeing the Geese  mignitry and the “Winter  Hibiscus” Saeng, “realized that many of the things that she had thought  of as strange before had become, through the guiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now. Like the geese.” Saeng realized that the test although strange and different to her now became familiar because of her experiences with nature. Seeing the geese and “Winter Hibiscus”. This plant also made Saeng think of her past in Vietnam and all of one good times back at her home. “The familiar  fragrance filled her lungs, and Saeng could  almost fast the light strures of her grandmothers long gray hair, freshly mashed.” The jolont made her think of good experiences. In the plant made her joyous enough not to think about past, but about the future, about taking the test again and her new life in the United States   
0	The reason why the author puts that last line into the story of the end is to show us the raids  and saeng  that even though us almost over. She doesn’t want  it to end but she know that it will also start up again. Next year when things goes back to the way they were before everything changed. This is why I think the author put that line into the story.
2	The author concluded the story with Saeng vowing to herself “in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that the test again” to express her determination of fitting into new things and to express the change she was getting used to. Describing spring was important in the conclusion because it described what Saeng once thought was odd in @LOCATION1, but got used to the seasons and weather changing. Once she realized that she needed to deal with change, she knew that she would need to try the driving test again. It was very important that the author’s conclusion was “in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again” because it expressed how Saeng was accepting change in her life.  
2	In “winter Hibiscus” the author uses hibiscus flower to symbolize beauty in unexpected places, adapting to a new life, and Saeng's home country at the end of the story I think that the author realizes that even though she failed the test, everything is going to be okay. While looking at the hibiscus she remembers her old life, which she loved, and she is reminded of the natural beauty that can be found in a hibiscus flower. In life, I think every one should always remember that even though one @MONTH1 be disappointed at sometime, we have to keep in mind, the fact that life goes on. There will always be another chance, as long as you can find peace and beauty in something good.
1	The author concludes with this paragraph to show how Saeng and the plant are similar. The plant represents Saeng’s strength and abilities. She knows that only when she is stronger, in the spring like the plant, will she be ready to retake the test. Her hopes will be stronger like the plant in the spring. That is why the author concluded with that paragraph.
2	I beleive the author ends the story with this paragraph because it refers to previous events in the story. For example it says, &quot;and this hibiscis is budding&quot;. This refers back to the beginning of the story when Saeng first saw the hibiscus plant and it reminded her of home. This is a good way to conclude a story. I wouldn’t change it at all if I could. Also in the summary before the story it says how she had failed her driver’s test and in the last paragraph it says, &quot;then I will take that test again,” I think Saeng didn’t have much confidence before taking the test because of her new surroundings but is now that she is familiar with everything and found a hobby she will think of passing while taking the test again. I think she is looking to start over and forget about failing.  
2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because she overcame and she wants to re take the quiz for herself and to prove it to herself no one else. she states “when they come back, saeng vowed to herself, in the spring, when the snow melt and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again. So she says that she wants to retake the test. So she is not being pressured into taking it. She is taking it to prove to herself no one else.
9	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, Computers are a vital source for anyone's household. Many people have busy lives and having a computer at home make it easer. You can use it for research, organization, and business matters. I don’t know what I would do without one. Education is very important especially in our economy today. The computer makes work and studying fast and simple. When you need to research a topc for school there is always an endless library of information @CAPS6 you turn on the computer. You @CAPS7 get your information from books, and encyclopedias but it is rare that you always have time, to get to a local library. Also, @CAPS6 you have a project in school that you need to type, it is helpful to have a computer at home so you don't have to use at short. This way, you have more time to get extra from teachers @CAPS3 on instrument in the school band. I can imagine that my grades would be @CAPS6 i did have access to the internet of @CAPS4 @CAPS5 at home. Have you over pare or document and had an of her and happens @CAPS6 you own a computer you can backup @CAPS7 you imagine on essay five pages and organized is boring, biut you wouldn't think so @CAPS6 it saved you from hours worth of writing! For some people, having a computer @CAPS7 make you money, and who wouldn't like more money? You can run a business online and avoid the hastle of manting a @CAPS8 your own space or building to run your business can be quite expensive and time-consuming. Also, you can refrain from making a trip from the store by purchasing items online. Then, the item will be shipped to your door. You save time and money on gas by doing so. And thise days, any way to save money is a good one! By having a computer you can boost your education.Keep yourself organized, and save money. Although it has many recreational purposes as well, it also can be very helpful in your life. And besides, is perfectly fine, to go online to talk to your friends once in a while, isn't it?
3	In the short story “Winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho, a young girl named saeng recalls her life before she moved to @LOCATION1 .She misses her homeland and all of the things she loved before she came here. Towards the end of the story, the author includes a paragraph saying that saeng vowed to take her drivers test again when winter ends, when the geese return, and the hibiscus is budding. The author concludes the story with this paragraph for one reason. He/She wants to show that saeng is strong enough to survive the winter, just like the hibiscus, and will be ready when the weary days of winter are over, and the beautiful days of spring come. Saeng’s mother states, &quot;…it’s strong enough to make it through the cold months…. That’s what matters&quot;. The winter hibiscus is a direct parallel to saeng in that just like it, she is strong enough to survive the winter months.
1	The author concludes the story with that paragraph to make the reader want more. When an author ends the chapter of a story or an episode of a show it is always a good idea to use a cliffhanger to drag the audience along. In many stories have read this is used. In my @CAPS1, the @PERSON1 book it always ends with a cliff-hanger. Like in the end of the third book one of the soldiers is killed but you don’t find out by who until the next book.
2	The author concludes this story the way she does to say that the girl not going to give up on trying to fit in this new country. The author concludes this way because it refers that its not over, and even though the test was a failure, it wont be next time. The author leads is know that the little girl cares about the test, and wants to prove to show people that she can pass it. She is reminded of her home by these flowers, and she has with this she can retake it and do it rite.
0	I think the author included that in the paragraph because Saeng didn't like the cold so she would wait until the snow melts and geese return to test the plants again. I also think she added it to show that she would come back to visit her mother.
1	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because Saeng failed the test and in the spring she will take the test over.
2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it provides closure to both Saeng and the story. Saeng was upset about the fact that she failed her test, but towards the end of the story she realizes that things happen, and sometimes we have no control over what happens, but you’ve also got to pick yourself up again if what happens, knocks you down. When seeing the geese and the hibiscus, she realizes that everyone and everything has to adapt to something new all the time. Saeng might have failed her driving test because they drive differently in Vietnam, so she will have to adopt to the way we drive here, along with all our rule and laws. This is why the author concludes the paragraph in that way.
1	Saeng was taking a test and she didn’t quite pass it She was afraid to tell to her mother but she has to tell her anyway. Her mother got upset because she didn’t pass it. Saeng knows  that right after winter's over, She’ll be taking that same test again and she hoped she will pass it this time.
3	In the story, “Winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho, the author includes the phrase, -When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again.- because she wanted to make the story end Saeng finding the positive views on her new home and positive views in the future and have her look forward to it. Throughout the short story, Saeng happens to have a sad disposition about her new home and how the plants remind her recent home.- “I mean its not the kind we at-at-“ she found that she was still too shaky to say the words at home, last she burt into tears again.- This phrase shows that Saeng really missed her home and was truly sad about it. The concluding phrase shown before shows that she found the strength to look positivly at the future of her new home.
2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because at the beginning of the story Saeng went to take a driving test but didn’t pass and so she goes and buys a hibiscus that reminds her of home and gives her strength and comfort. So her mother says this at the end because she knows Saeng is going through a hard time adapting to her new country and she doesn’t want to put more pressure on her just because she knows Saeng is very upset and is trying to make it up to her by buy a flower for her so she says by next spring she should be adapted and ready for the test because the flower should give her hope. She wants her to know she is three for her.
8	Dear @CAPS1 I think more and more people use computers because it can help you find a job if you lost it. Because right now some job are going bank ruded. And parants can not help because they didn't have job to support there love ones. Another thing is that cars are going up on prices so if you don't have a lot of money you can go online and get a car and truck for great prices. And it can help you save a lot of money in your pocet. For some reason @NUM1 out of @NUM2 people like to go to far away places for example @CAPS2, put or @LOCATION1, @CAPS3. And you if go to these place then you would need place to stay and have a good meal with your family or friends. So you would need a nice pleasant holetitle which will have awsome food, beds, pools and more thing people like to do when they is on vaction. And for example if your mother or father what you to go to your public school but you don't what too because you heared something or about the school say because you cant find great school online for example @CAPS4, cap pre, classicle, brizzal, And some other school are the best to and fun to go to and be succesful with your life. Now you know why more and more people use computers and you should always use technology and it would help you on the hand eye giving people the ability to learn about use computers.
1	I think the author of “Winter Hibiscus” said “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, the I will take the test  again.” to conclude the story for many reasons. First reason is it shows that she isn’t giving up. The second reason is it gives a feeling of hope of whats to come. The last reason is it leaves us wondering if she makes it next time. That is probably why the author ended it that way.
3	The author of the Winter Hibiscus concludes the story with the paragraph to show the connection between the hibiscus and @CAPS1. The hibiscus has to survive the winter until spring were it can bloom and became big and beautiful. @CAPS1 is connecting to the flower and saying she can make it through her obstacles that come with the change in enviroment if the flower can deal with being confined in a plastic container and surviving the weather. She feels that right now she's likes the Hibiscus. She’s trapped because the area is alien to her and she has to adjust. Just as the container is alien to the flower because it’s used to being free. But once it’s planted, it will become a part of it's surroundings and grow. And once she accepts the change and becomes willing to start over, she will begin to grow and that will cause her driving test to be easier. In conclusion, this is the reason the author concluded the paragraph with this sentence.
3	In the short story “Winter Hibiscus”, the author ends with the main character Saeng saying that she will take the test “when the snow melts and the geese return.” I believe that the Hibiscus and the driver’s test are relevant like the blooming of a flower. If it wilts at the first, it can blossom later on, thus the author included this to show that Saeng wilted at first, but will blossom at spring. It also a symbol of her constant blossoming. The author’s intention of the lost line was demonstrated early when Saeng was disappointed of falling the test. She is upset that she failed her driver’s test, but when she sees a flower from her homeland, she starts to get boosted and start to weep a little. It shows her blossoming because she changes from a negative mood to a positive one, after seeing the flower from her childhood memory. It shows her wilt and blossom again when she tells her mother the news about the test. At first she gets nervous and scared, so scared she tears the leaf off and shreds it to pieces. Her mother then wipes the green matter of and asks her to plant it. Saeng then gets a morale boost and start to feel better. This once again shows her blossoming because she thought her mother would yell at her for failing the test, but instead accepts the plant, showing her rise again. Saeng falters throughout the story, but manages to rise above it all and give herself determination to meet her goal. She is determined to pass the test when spring arrives, and blossom again. The Hibiscus shows it with its budding stage. It will blossom like Saeng.  
1	The author probably includes part of the story with the paragraph to put more details into the paragraph. The author trying to talk about the life that Saeng had vowed silently to herself in the spring when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding then I will take that test again, saying that when flowers start blooming again and spring comes around again thats when I will take that test and pass this time.
2	I think the author concludes the story with this because shes proving she has the strength to do something that she failed the first time again. She took this plant and looked at it as a memory and a passage of time. Saeng planted it as a reminder of home and her promise. Saeng said, ”Its not a real one”  &quot;Not like the kind we had before.” Saeng loved home and wish she was back there but her new promise was what had mattered.
1	The author concludes this the story with this paragraph   because its start a whole new  day time . That saying  means  that  she  will  take  the  test on a budding  new day .for  example, the   geese  return  her its spring and  hibiscus budd  and  she  has the test  in  the spring  so it  will  start  why the author concludes the  story  with that paragraph.
1	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because she wants to take the driving test in spring time. Spring time is a symbol of positive feelingsshe gets positive feelings from the blooming of the winter hibiscus.
0	They had to come back so they did and they were walking into an then world over there in the corner and the childhood world to just as she had known it would feel.
2	This last paragraph is written for several reasons. First, she will try again when she feels the time is right. Just like the geese coming back, Saeng will comebak to take the test, and so the Hibiscus plant will also bloom again. She feels that it is the right thing to do and it will be the right time to come back and take the test. This pharagraph describes Saeng well about how she lives and how she will take the test again when she feelsit is right.
2	I believe that the author ends because the author is showing that Saeng is determined to pass the test. &quot;She paused as she noticed the tearstains on her daughter's cheeks and her puffy eyes. &quot;(Ho) This quote shows that passing the test meant a lot to Saeng. She was crying because she couldn't help but buy the plant and fail the test. She didn't want to fail and showed her sadness by crying.” then I will take the test again.” (Ho) This quote shows that even though she failed, she is determined to pass the test and succeed. Failing hurt her greatly. so she can't wait to do it again and pass because she is determing to succeed. This is all important because Saeng shows that determination is the key to success and she is determined.
8	Dear Newspaper, In my opinon I think computers do have a positive affect on people. They can learn about far away places. They let people talk online. It can even help you find a job. This is why I think computers are very positive. Certainly, people can learn about far away places on the computer. Say, someone wanted to take a trip to @LOCATION1 they can look it up, learn the launage. They can by tickets. They could also find interesting things to see in that country. These reasons are why I think a computer is a positive technology. My next reason I think a computer is positive toward people is that people can comuicate online. This can help keep families in touch. It can help you find and talk to old friends (facebook). You can even make new friends to talk to. These are other examples why I think computers are positive. My last reason I think computer have a positive affect on people is that it can help you with jobs. It can help you find a job. It can also help you with your job. Lastly, it can have you have a higher position at your job. These are my reasons I think computers are important and positive to people. For all the reasons above are reasons I think computers are an awesome =) and positive technology, I mean just look at all the reasons. They let people talk online. They can also teach you about far away places. And even help you with your job. This is why I think computers have a positive affect on people.
1	The author uses this paragraph to conclude the story to show saeng determination and her adaption to her new home. This shows her determination because it say “I will take that test again.&quot; This also shows that she has adapt to her new home.
1	I think the author concludes the story with this paragraph because she was upset that she moved. She is also upset that she failed her drivers test. So she planted the plant and shes says that when spring comes, she will retry her drivers test
2	In the story, “Winter Hibiscus&quot;, by Minfong Ho, the author concludes the story with a paragraph with Saeng vowing she will take the test again in the spring. Minfong used this paragraph because it means never give up, even if you fail the first time. For example, Saeng just failed her drivers test but after buying the Hibiscus and taking deeper into things she realized she shouldn’t give up.
2	The author concludes with this sentence for emphasis. It takes Saeng’s mind off of the flower and she focuses on her test. By waiting until next spring to take the test it gives her something to look forward to. This statement also shows that you should never give up on anything that you do. The author ends on a good note explaining this, The last paragraph is also a break from the rest of the story and from what Saeng‘s was just doing. It is Saeng’s last and final thoughts.
0	The author concludes the story with that paragraph I think to say that when the hibiscus start to grow back she will be back at what she started. I think that is why because she says “In the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is building, then I will take that test again.”
0	The author concludes the story with a paragraph so the people reading the story would actually read it and not guess how the story is goin to go.
0	The authors conclusion in the story explains that after all that team work and handwork you should keep that flow going each year even though something might have changed.
3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to create a feeling of hope. Saeng had a bad, from failing the test to her deep feeling of loss, @CAPS1 after finding the hibiscus and planting it she seemed to be enlightened, while as she missed her home land but still had the memories, which was comforting to her. She shows determination, because she declares she will take that test again, and seems to have more confidence in herself. The author adds that saeng will take the test again in the spring. When looking at archetypes, spring is time of new beginning and life. When the hibiscus is budding(being reborn), she will take the test. It will be a new, better start for saeng too.
2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show determination. It shows that saeng wants to take her time to adjust to her new life and her  new surroundings. Then she thinks it might feel more like this place is becoming a home. She feels that maybe, if shes been used to this new place for awhile she will have a better chance at passing the test. she is determined to pass the test.
2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because when Saeng was saying this to herself, she made a promise to not give up getting her license and the hibiscus makes her feel like she is at home again. In the text when the mother says, &quot;@CAPS1 seen this kind blooming along the lake. Its flowers arent as pretty, but its strong enough to make it through the cold months here, this winter hibiscus. Thats what matters.” when she says this it makes Saeng not sad because she knows that the hibiscus will remind her of the hibiscus at home and that gives her the power to want to try again in the spring.
8	According to the @ORGANIZATION1 govermant @PERCENT1 of @CAPS1 spend @NUM1 hours or more on a computer a day. A study shows @CAPS1 are't getting enough exercise, aren't spending enough time with fmaily, aren't enjoying their lives. Right now people would rather be on the computer then doing other stuff.Since more people have been using the computer those people heven't enough exercise. Now @PERCENT2 of @CAPS1 have gone obese since they have always been or the computers, @CAPS4 year a @CAPS6 was fit and healthy, but when a friend told him about a website within the @CAPS5 @NUM2 minutes. After @NUM1 months, the fit and healthy @CAPS6 became obese. The @CAPS6 would always have junk food when @CAPS7 was on the computer. when @DATE1 came, @CAPS7 tryed out for his school baseball team. @CAPS7 didn't make it because @CAPS7 was out of shape. After that happened, @CAPS7 went to his old ways by eating healthy and exercising. Now that @CAPS6 is in shape for any sport @CAPS7 plays. Next people aren't spending enough time with their families. A lot of jobs require people to be on the computer. When that happens a person will forget whats really important to them. A couple years ago, a @CAPS6 was going to have the biggest game of his life. It was the championship game. @CAPS7 was reminding his dad about it all. When the gone was about to start, the @CAPS6 looked into the crowd for his dad. @CAPS7 didn't see him at all. The @CAPS6 was just think his dad was. after the @CAPS5, @CAPS7 looked again, but now @CAPS7 was sad. His own dad wasn't at the game. His team @CAPS4 the game. Now his dad doesn't miss a thing since @CAPS7 doesn't go on the computer as often. Finally, people aren't enjoying their lives they would rather be on a computer than doing stuff they like. One @CAPS6 used to always play basketball with his friends when @CAPS7 started to go on the computers, everything changed people would ask him to play, but @CAPS7 would say no. The computer was the only things that mattered. When the @CAPS6 tryed out for his @CAPS8 school @CAPS7 didn't make it because @CAPS7 forgot how to play. When that happened, @CAPS7 stopped using the computer and went back to basketball. now when @CAPS7 tries out., @CAPS7 makes. It's now or never to decide either waste your life on a computer or live your life. I would rather live life than be on a computer.
2	The author concludes the story with “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” I think that the author includes this paragraph to show how persistant Saeng is. Saeng is persistant because she trys over and over again at this “test” and also she trys to get used to her new country. It demonstrates this in the story when it says the quote above. This quote shows that Saeng can try something and fail, then be determined to try and succeed again. Also in the story, Saeng has moved from one country to another. This is a huge jump and for her to be confident with herself is very persistant. The way the author concludes the story, with “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again” definitely portrays Saeng, the main character as a persistant person, and that is the purpose of the quote.
1	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because he want the ourtose to think about what he said to want to read more. For example I was reading a book that end in a quesiton and I wanted to read more of what the answer to the quesition is. Another example is that I was reading another book and that was ending in a stentment So I want to read anther book that they have but they don't have One so I don't know how the story ended. Thats why the end stories like that so they can make you read another book with the ending.
3	The author concludes the story with that paragraph for many reasons. The author wanted to convey a sense of hope to show the growth of her character, and to show how thing are  going to change. In the last paragraph when she vows that she will take that test again it gives you a sense that everything will be okay. Earlier in the story she had been crying and missing her homeland the tone was troubled and sad. This last paragraph suggests that the tone is now hopeful. Even though she failed the test she is still going to try again. The author also put the paragraph to show how much her character has grow. Saying that she will try again shows how much stronger determed she is lastly, she had the story end with that paragraph to foreshadow what is to come.The geese coming back and the snow melting, and the hibiscus budding all show a change in the seasons. This represents the change that has occurred in her and it foreshadows that things will be different from now on.
1	The author concluded the story with that message is because If you think about it. if not that seems all the whole story and leavs a opening for a requal. It's ovious that whole point of the story is to make you think.
0	I think the author add this paragraph because it a sign of a new start for her. Because she has hard time no doesn’t main the she will alway have hard times.
1	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because It meant a lot to Saeng. Saeng failed her driving test and scared to tell her mother that she also spent nineteen dollars for ‘Dok Faeng-noi which was a flower/plant they had back at home. For example, “As Saeng walks home after failing her driver’s test, she sees a familiar plant.” The plant Saeng saw meant a lot to her mother. “@PERSON1 uttered a small cry of surprise and delight.” Dok faeng-nor” she said. “where did you get it.” That was a quote stating that her mother was excited to hear that. The story is concluded by that paragraph because after all saeng went through her mother was glad she bought it. “It’s a beautiful plant, this dok faeng- noi,” she finally said. “I’m glad you got it.”
1	Authors sometimes use intisting sentences as there concludy sentence that you @MONTH1 have a hard time understding. In the story “Winter Hibiscus” The author concludes her story by saying “when they come back. Saeng vowed siletly to herself, iN the sprng, when the snows melt and the gesse return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” The author says this to show that Saeng is not ready to gardam yet and needs to lean more. The mother is verry disapointed in the daghter for buying a plant that is very expensve and shows her inexperience in that buying thigs because of your fodings is wrong. This is showed wha they say “I paid over Nineteen dollars for it.&quot; ” You what?” She also, says “ @CAPS1 facing. Na where did you gott that&quot; showing her suprise of the expensve beutiful plant. Authes use those paragraphs and sentences to show or recap the story. The Author of “winter hibiscus” @CAPS2 her story with the paragraph because Saeng shuld Not hav boght the plant bascal a hav emotions and that she shall try agan Next year to not mess up.
2	The  author  of  the  passage  ends  the  story  with this  statements  to  creates curiosity. Thi creates curiosity through writing for the spring and the geese to return.Spring is the beginning for many creatures on  the earth  therefore ,Saeng  is  trying  to  start  over  because  she  must  wait  for  the spring. The hibiscus reinforces the feeling of a new beginningin that each year new bad grow just  like  she can have a second chance. Saeng  waits for  the  spring  because she knows that is when every thing else creates new life so Saeng must wait till then to get her new beginning
1	I think the reason why the author ended the story with that paragraph was because that will be the time she thinks she will be ready to retake the driver’s test. Before she made that move she was dishearted because she failed the test. Maybe she picked the spring time because that gives her time to get herself together and practice between them and the spring time 
1	The author includes this scentence, “When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,” to show her determination. She is determined to pass the test. Even if she is facing problems adapting to @LOCATION1 she wents to sucseed here. So she will wait a year and then try again when she is better prepared.
10	Dear Newspaper, @ORGANIZATION1 has an essay due on plants for science tomorrow. She was absent @DATE1 and didn't know about it. If she had a computer, she could go on to the website and check, but she doesn't. The town took them away. Another student, @LOCATION1, is working on the same essay. Her handwriting is terrible so her teacher will not be able to score it. What are they to do? Although many some say that computers are not good for society, most know that life without computers would be a disaster. New @CAPS1 is currently thinking about taking away computers in our town. This would be a big problem for everybody involved. One reason is that people need it to get information from search engines like &quot;google&quot; and &quot;yahoo&quot;. They also use the internet for communication like &quot;facebook&quot; and &quot;aim&quot;. Taking away computers would drastically impact every day life. Society computers to get information. I know that whenever I don't know something I just look it up online. If I didn't have this resource, my homework would not be as detailed as it is with the computer. Another example is that public look up information about the world on my computer. When many heard about earthquake in @LOCATION2, they could pull up information within seconds. This led to many bake sales and fund raisers. Lastly, when kids miss their favorite @CAPS2 shows one day, they can just look it up the next day to get caught up. This is a big part of teenager life. Society needs computers in order to look up crucial information. Many people also use the internet for communication purposes. I know that in my family &quot;e-mail&quot; is what makes it all work. My mom makes all her plans by email and sometimes even e-mails herself from work to remember things. Without it, our family would not be able to function. Another mode of communication is &quot;facebook&quot;. Any time my friends and I have a question about anything anything that happened that day. We will ask each other on this website. It is safe and saves all the trouble of calling on the phone. A final example is &quot;aim&quot;. This is a messaging tool that lets you talk instantly with friends and even see them with &quot;video-chatting&quot;. My friends and I would not be able to show each others outfits and other items without &quot;aim&quot;. Teenagers as well as adults need to communicate through computers. In conclusion, society needs computers in order to look up info, as well as talk with friends and co workers. Do not even think about 
2	From the story of the girl just moved from Vietnam to United @ORGANIZATION1. It will be hard for the girl to understand anything and anything can bring her memory back about Vietnam. The author concludes the story with this paragraph because she did fail the test and see wants to see the hibiscus is budding. “I-I failed the test,” Saeng said it to her mother. Her mother actually understand why it happen and she will let Saeng keep the hibiscus because it will make Saeng feel better. Saeng miss Vietnam a lot and will like to try her best to overcome obstacles.
0	The author concludes this paragraph because he wants to make it more clearer so the readers would understand It more. And so he could, make it better to stand out. 
1	The author finished off the story with that paragraph because the paragraph is saying that overtime when she is adapted well to every thing she will be able to take the test, so that’s why she says “…and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding,…” “@CAPS1 that all it needs is time. Time to get warm and time to grow. Also the paragraph is well thought out and relates to the entire story. So she concluded with a great paragraph that made a lot of sense in relationship with the story.
3	In the story, &quot;Winter Hibiscus,&quot; by Minfong Ho, Ho concludes the story with the paragraph due to the fact the flower represents her hapiness from her home. The flower symbolizes the past and comfort, once Saeng began to dig the &quot;winter hibiscus&quot; In, &quot;she could hear the sounds of cooking from the kitchen now,&quot; All of Saeng’s sense were beginning to return; she was happy, likewise, the author uses the geese to explain the comfort of Saeng. The country around her began to feel like home. She became familiar with her surroundings. Many references to home was made throughout the piece because home is a place of comfort and happiness. therefore, Saeng would gain more confidence, which explans the reason @CAPS1 Ho concluded with that sentence.
1	I think the author concludes the story with this paragraph “When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, iN the spring, wheN the @CAPS1 melt and the geese RetuRN and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again” means to the author kinda like the meaning to life. That if you mess up its okay just try again and do better.
0	She concludes that paragraph with the story because she realy wants the people to realize that she is and and is always having fun. Also that she love where she at. Shes making in the world and she loves wathing flower, “geese return and this hibiscus is budding” that show that her favorite thing to do  that she loves is flowers.
2	The author concludes this story this way to go over again the important things in the story. “I will  take that test again,” This is the test that she had failed that day. The test that she failed tested her memory of her home. Her old country was so important to her. The part in the quote,” when they come back.... when the show me it and the geese return,” is referring to when she says,” She realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become … almost familiar to her. Like the geese,” She is saying that everything in this country she is starting to get used to like the geese that fly south every winter.” When she uses &quot;and this hibiscus is budding,&quot; she is saying how she will remember all the things she has forgotten when she moved over here to this country.” When she got to the hibiscus, she reached out and touched a petal gently. It felt smooth and cool, with a hint of velvet toward the center –just as she had known it would feel. This whole statement is basically saying  that she is starting to forget things in her country as this country becomes more familiar but when the geese return meaning in the @DATE1 then she will remember again and she will take that test again of her knowledge and pass.
1	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because he/she is trying to put across the message that the plant shows a symbol of new beginings which is a symbol of saeng’s vowe. Also in the story caring for the plant teaches saeng responsablity in obtaining her license by care for the plant it will teach her patients and that she needs to learn from mistakes made.
2	The author ends the story with this paragraph because it shows she is not willing to give up on her new life. “I-I failed the test,” Saeng had failed her drivers test and was very unhappy. She also disliked her new home. “She was still too shaky to say at home” she missed her old home and she really wanted to give up. After talking to her mother, it renewed her hopes so the author uses this paragraph to signify that she still have hope in the end and when she is ready she will try again. “When the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take this test again.”  
1	The author concludes this in the story to show tone. The paragraph shows how Saeng was determined to try again a pass. This teaches a lesson to the reader. Lessons to try your hardestand don’t give up. The last paragraph ends the story with a sence of curiosity. It makes you want to no more or if she passes.
9	I am so happy, I just finished my school report on @PERSON1 and I didn't even need to leave my house. I was able to talk with my classmate and ask her questions online. I also managed to get all the information just from my computer. I also learned how to row a boat, to show my class how @LOCATION1 crossed the @CAPS1 river, I learned that by taking on online course. This is one situation why computers have fantastic effects on people in everyday situations. Local research show that @PERCENT1 of @CAPS2 planning their vocation use the internet. The reason these citizens use internet is to get the information about the hotel and vacation cite. That is one way that makes computers helpful and positive devices, beacuse it makes it easier for busy @CAPS2 to get ready for a trip by looking at pictures of the hotel online and getting all the info they need. Doctor @PERSON2 of @CAPS4 university says &quot;computers now offer programs that allow busy @CAPS2 to learn a new skill, @PERCENT2 of @CAPS2 currently use this software. &quot;@CAPS7 everyday @CAPS2 don't have time to go out a join a group or class to learn new skills. That is why computers are so helpful and people just love them. Instead of leaving home they can be cooking, doing yoga, or speaking a new language all from their computer at home. That is another reason why computers are useful in vey positive ways. Imagine forgetting your homework at school and not be able to an A in that class. Well because of computers forgetful students can talk to a classmate online and get the homework and do it. Or they could even use the internet to go to that school website and find the homework and print it out. Many students around the country forget homework once in a while, because of helpful computers they can fix their problems easily. Let's recap, students or adults can get information off the internet for projects or even vacations. Busy @CAPS2 who don't have time to leave their house can take a class or learn a new skill right on the computer. Anyone can use the internet to talk or chat online to get school work or to long distance friends. That is why the effects on computers to people are nothing but positive. Now what can you do? It is important that computers stay in our lives, they are helpful and we have learned to live with them, which is why they must stay. This benefits you because newspaper houses are organized by computers and it keeps you business running.
1	I think that the concluding paragraph means after everything   else   important and what is meant to happen happens then she will take the test because its  basically the last  thing has to happen and I think she will pass it because it meant to happen.
1	I belive that saeng made that silent vow to herself was because after the plant goes though the hard winter and once everything goes back to how she likes it and the plant starts budding again, that that kind of represents her hardtime with moving so if this plant that she loves so much can make it through it then she can too.
2	The author of “Winter Hibiscus” concludes the story with  the excerpt &quot;when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again” because it emphasizes Saeng pain to come to an unknown place and fail her first test but also emphasizes Saeng’s resolve to work hard after seeing a flower that resembled one from home. The flower itself is very important to Saeng, for example, the text reads “And besides it was yet another old friend. a small shrub with waxy leaves and dainty flowers with purplish petals and white centers.” This excerpt demonstrates Saeng’s love for her hometown through a flower that she knows grows back home. Another example is when Saeng told her mother the bad news “I-I failed the test” @CAPS1 attention instantly was drawn to the flower and her mother could only be good. In conclusion, the hibiscus flower is Saeng’s source of stength as it’s the only thing she knows in the united states. Saeng wants to show the same resolve on her test that the  flower shows in the harsh winter.
2	The author concludes the story with the afore mentioned paragraph to represent the connection between the return of the hibiscus’s bids, and the return of Saeng’s resolve. In the photograph for question #@NUM1, the hibiscus flower is out of place, as if it doesn’t belong similar to Saeng. The hibiscus represented the link to Saeng’s past, as portrayed when the author writes: “Plants that she had not even realized she had known but had forgotten drew her back into her childhood world.” The hibiscus was native to her homeland, and by helping Saeng to remember her past, she began to cope with the present, and later the future, “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding then I will take that test again.
2	By this quote, the author is explaining that Saeng will eventually be ready for her test. When the geese return, they're ready to return From their migration and when the hibiscus is budding, it is ready to turn into a beautiful flower. Saeng believes that in the spring, since the flower and the geese are ready, she too will be ready.
3	The author concludes with this paragraph because the narrarator is now willing to accept and adapt to her new environment like the flower and the flower would do. Geese like the warm and not the cold so they are flying south for the winter. Saeng’s “comfort tone” is in @LOCATION1 where she has many childhood memories; including her grandmother and the hibiscus flower. She is used to the flower being in a warm environment. So, when the geese come back in the spring and when the flower blossoms again, she will be ready to adapt to @CAPS1 life more and take her drivers test. The geese and the hibiscus flower are a symbolic memory of her old home in @LOCATION1 which she misses very much. After these things come to try and adapt to @CAPS1 ways of life. 
0	Saeng would return to her homeland.
2	In the passage “winter hibiscus” the author uses this phrase in the last paragraph “when they came back, Saeng vowes silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melt and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, I will take that test again. I believe she concluded this story with these words she change because she is saying to you in that means when the birds flewaway. Even the bird seasons would be back like always. An example of this is when she says the birds eased into the hibiscus. Mingled because the last paragraph thinking that she would stay again next season and keys very what she likes to do. This what I get out as the last paragraph are the story “winter hibiscus” as what it means to me.
0	The author concludes this story with the paragraph is that the author is showing  that when it becomes spring and the geese are budding she said silently to her self that she is going  to take the permit again. 
2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because she wants to show saeng’s determination to survive and be happy in her new home. Although she isn’t happy with her purchase she is trying to make it seem more homey. When  she says “will take that test again”she shows how she wants her surroundings to be comfortable. By ending with this paragraph it also shows a strongness in seasons. As it saeng will start over and try again with her life. She is content for the moment but is planning to please herself and her mother again in the spring. This paragraph also serves as a promise to discover a new way to live and make friends. The  plant is like a symbol of how she is going to change she is going to investigate and pass her own test proving she diserves to be happy and make herself feel at home.
8	Many People in Society think computers are bad, I think computers are exellent. Computers allow you to comunicate with your friends, family and relatives. With a computer you can do home work extra fast, no having to go to the library to look stuff up. Computers also allow you to take out anger on ones and zeros. Muny experts like @ORGANIZATION1 think people will talk to stranger on website like facebook and myspace. If parent place him son the websites and also make it so only freinds can you profile you will be alot safer. Comunications engineer @PERSON1 says that it is better for people to talk from it online than not I know he is correct because I have relatile in the @LOCATION1 that I love talking to but they are @NUM1 miles away so communication is or I to get, then I got a facebook and it is like they are next door. @CAPS1. @ORGANIZATION2 @PERSON1 says that @PERCENT1 of strangers that are molestores/ thugs go, after, people who don't protect their profile so protect your profile and be safe. Computers are better than going to the libra! This is there because going to the library means you have to round up the kids get in the cor and go. With a computer you can just go into your office and do re search, That saves money or gas. If you have a prodject of you can just send it straight to they teacher. In many today experts like @CAPS1. @ORGANIZATION2 a conducting experiment that are rigged. Violence they say is cursed by the games but they use test subjects like an the bad people you dont want to meet. I Have found video games to be a great let out for stress biut up during the day. Muny of my friends have also found this. Video games make you think that is also reason they are good. In conclusion computers are exelent. They make it so ther is the ability to communicate with friends alow you to take out anger. What is not to love? Get a computer now!!
0	The author concluded this paragraph in the story because it was showing that there are geese that hang around the garden around the spring time.
1	The author in this story explaynes how hard some changes can be. The author also explayns how family and object frome home such as the flower can be comforting. The meaning of the story is to show one of the author expierances in life.
0	I think the author concludes this party because he wanted to let the reader know that it wasn’t it for the little girl and she wasn’t going to give up on planting flower and that when the spring come and the snow had melt she was going to plant some more flower and see how they will do during the spring even though that it didn’t work as well as the winter season she did let her stop her I think the author is trying to say is that if you do something and it doesn’t work keep on trying maybe something different will happen.
2	In the story “Winter Hibiscus,” the author concludes the story with, “When they come back take that test again. “She does this to show that she still has hope, and won’t just give up. She went through a lot when she moved, and seemed to have  a sense of depression in the story. after all her sadness within the story, she finally gets the energy back to tell herself, keep trying. “@CAPS1 I will take that test again.” (shows hope).”And in the warm moist shelter of the greenhouse, Saeng broke down and wept.” She is obviously upset because the plant reminds her of home. as a conclusion, I thought  that it was a very wise choice to end the passage with a positive addittude.  
2	I think the author ends the story with this paragraph for many reasons. One reason is because It leaves you knowing that Saeng will never give up tring. Another reason is that something as simple as a flower can encourage someone to keep going even if they have nothing to go for. Saeng says that flower is something so important, that working harder will encourage her to keep doing the best she can. The author leaves you with this sentence because it is very powerful and brings Saeng courage.  
1	The author concludes the story with this because she failed the test already and wanted to pass it nexttime So she doesn't make her mother dissapointed in her.
0	I think what the narrator means by saying this she wants to come back when everything is beautifle again. She wants to WAIT FOR ALL OF THE SNOW TO MELT AND GEESE TO RETURN SO SHE CAN SEE ALL THE COLORS OF THE FLOURS AND IF SHE PASSES HER TEST THIS TIME, SHE WILL GET TO DRIVE PAST ALL THE FLOURS. THATS WHAT I THINK THE CHARECTER MEANS iN THiS STORY.
2	The author of this story ends the story with this paragraph because it explains how Saeng will not give up, just as the hibiscus does not. Earlier in the story, it explains how the winter hibiscus does not die. In the paragraph, when it says, the snows melt, this means that the seasons will keep going, just as Saeng should keep going and trying. Also when the author says and the geese return, this means that the geese will keep coming back just as Saeng should keep trying to take the test.
0	I belive the author used these lines in the last paragraph “When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding then I will take that test again.” @CAPS1 he realy liked it.
0	I think the author concludes that paragraphs to show more meaning of the story.The author could of wanted to show more details in the story.
10	Although some people believe that computers turn us children into zombies, I believe that they effect us in a posotive way. Computers can help us explore far away places that we @MONTH1 never go to. Maybe help us connect with an old friend or just a little help on homeworks. One reason why I think computers are only helping us is they help us explore othe places. I know for a fact that every kid dreams of a place that they would love to visit. But not at all of us can afford to travel far away. Most families however, do have computers. With these computers, kids with a parents permission, can use the internet to learn tons of cool facts about their place. &quot;I have always wanted to go to @LOCATION1 but my parents just don't have the proper incomg&quot; said @PERSON1 of @CAPS1-@CAPS2 @CAPS3 school @CAPS4 I used my @CAPS6 and the internet to discover. HUNDREDS of amazing facts on it.&quot; @CAPS4 as you can see computers can help people realize their dreams. Another reason why I think computers are good is they help you connect with friends. If you are like me, you like to talk to your friends. A @CAPS5! But sometimes they are too far away to call if you don't want to pay for it. A solution a new wonderful machine called. The @CAPS6! You can chat long distances without being for it. This is especially good for me because not too long ago, one of my best friends moved away to @LOCATION2. I thoughy I would never talk to him again. Then I learned about @CAPS7 @CAPS8. It allows you to talk whenever you want, whenever you want! Now, me and my friend can stay in touch and @CAPS4 can you! My finale reason as to why I think computers are good is they can help you on homework too. Even have a tricky math problem you couldn't figure out? How about the capital of a state that visit, slipped your mined? Well the @CAPS6 can solve both of those problems and more! @PERCENT1 of computers these days come with soft wear in them that comes with a calculator. For the other @PERCENT1 you can download and install softwear onto your @CAPS6 for a low price. And every @CAPS6 made in this world has internet capabilities. All's you need to do is it on and get ready for a ride! @CAPS4 don'y worry about too much @CAPS6 use, because computers can only help us not hurt us. @CAPS4 remember, computers help us live our dreams to the full extent. they also help us connect with no another, and help us excel in school. @CAPS4 get on, and get goin. Have you used your @CAPS6 today?
10	Each year the world becomes more and more advance in technology. Technology helps and benefits us all in a good positive way. Computers are apart of this positive technology and definetely benefits society. Computers help us look up places and things we never seen before and teaches us about them, too. In addition, computers have a positive impact on families and benefits them greatly. Also, they help people from adults years out of college to teenagers in high school communicate with their friends. Therefore, computers help us all in some little way and makes life easier and more fun. To begin with computers helps us expand our knowledge. It us helps us look up facts or recent news quickly. For example, just recently the @DATE1 @CAPS1 occured and they usualy go late into the night so I didn't get to see the whole competition. I could just easily go look it up on the computer to see who won which medals. computers helped me by looking up the medals quick so I woudn't have to wonder who won a medals not. Computers help us expand our knowledge all the time. They help us look up facts for report, places we want to travel to, learn about the benefits of a certain pet and the posibilities can be endless. to continue with, computers help families by bringing them closer in a way. A family member could be watching a funny on youtube or @ORGANIZATION1 and could think its so funny that they want their whole family to see it you. In addition, stores sell clothes online now so mother and daugther can sit down together and shop without leaving the house. Computers bring my family together by we rent movies from @LOCATION1 on the computer. It brings us together when choose and pick which movie to rent. Also, it brings us together to have a family movie night. As a result, these things the computer gives brings out discussion in the family and gives a good topic that everyone can relate to and talk about. Another way computers are beneficial is they bring everyone together. There are many ways communicate on the computer these days. There is facebook, twitter, email, aim, and many more. They are all different, but they have one thing in common is to bring old friends and new friends together. For instance my mom just sign on to be in facebook so she can talk to all her old friends from highschool and she found one really good friends who she hasn't seen in ages it made her really happy. Therefore, it shows that computers aren't just for bringing new people together, old ones, too.
2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because she wants to show how she will start over by retaking the test, just as the hibiscus will start over by budding new flowers. Saeng shows us how she will try to overcome the obstacles she must face, just like the hibiscus flower and geese will overcome the winter. In the story, the author makes the hibiscus represent the way to adjust to the changes in life. In a way, the winter hibiscus represents Saeng because the flower is adapting to circumstances, the circumstance being winter. Just like the hibiscus flower, Saeng must overcome her obstacles of being in a new country, and retaking her drivers exam.
2	“When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” is the paragraph that the author uses to conclude the story. In the my opinion the author includes this paragraph to conclude the story in order to show Saeng is committed to adjusting  to her new home and to leaving her old one. For example, in the story Saeng was unable to say “I mean, not like the kind we had at home.” without bursting into tears. This illustrates her sorrow and inability to let go of her past.
1	The author could have finished the story with that paragraph for many reasons. He/she probably finished with the paragraph to show that Saeng cared about adapting to her new place and was not a failure or quiter. The author also probably finished the story this way to show that Saeng was determined for success and to make her mother happy. This is why the author finished the story with the paragraph.
2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because Saeng is given a small glimmer of hope by the winter hibiscus. The hibiscus reminds her of her homeland, Vietnam, which pleases her. Also, the fact that the hibiscus she purchases can survive winter, unlike the hibiscus of her homeland, symbolizes Saeng’s determination to adapt to her new country. The future of the hibiscus symbolizes Saeng’s survival and adaptation to her new country, which will include her retaking her driving test.
2	The author concludes her story with this statement for many reasons. First the Hibiscus will be strong again when the wind stops blowing. therefore, Saeng will be strong too. Also, Saeng is giving herself time to adjust and get used to her new surroundings. She is setting a real goal for herself. Saeng is identifieng with the flower. It gives her comfort, and brings back valuable memories of the things she loved and the things that made her happy, like her home country, and her grandmother.
2	The author of this story concludes it with this paragraph to show Saeng’s  determination .  I  say this hibiscus in  the  story the sees  the  plant and it joyed to see it and is so happy but the reminders doing her grandmother ‘s  hair she  tries.  She snow this as a test for herself . She  want to see if she could be on and try not will on the past . When she  isn’t  home she said “ I failed the test .” This snows melt she want is to move on but it hasn’t  as  easy as she hope it to be. So when the as this hibiscus the shows life this paragraph it shows that Saeng is trying  to move on and she is different  to  a English her seal.
2	In the story, I believe Saeng is sad because she misses her home and the hibiscus flower. She ends the story off well because she can now have a since of peace with herself by waiting to take the test again. I believe that’s why she ended the story like she did so she doesn’t leave herself worried or angry. She can turn a negative attitude into a positive one when she says she will retake the test when the geese return and hibiscus is budding.
2	The author concludes with this sentence because it shows that Saeng is going to try to adapt to her new home. He lets you know that Saeng is not gonna grieve and be sad anymore, but she will adapt and continue on with her life. The author adds this: “I mean, not like the kind we had @NUM1at-”. This is when Saeng has just come home and talked to her mother and she is very sad because she thought about old memories at her old home, but by adding the last statement of the story it shows that Saeng has decided to move on with life and no longer be sad. She has set a goal to accept it. This is the reason for the author to conclude his story like he does.
2	Many authors end their storys in different ways. But Minfong Ho ended hers with almost a saying One reason she ended her story this way was she kinda revealed what would happen to Saeng in the future. Like in the end it says “I will take that test again.” This lets the reader know that she, the author, might write another story about Saeng but it is when she takes the test again. A second example is showing that Saeng is strong and beautiful but will try again. This is show when the author said “when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding.” see she said this hibiscus which is referring to Saeng. Without some of these writings techniques and hints we might not know if there will be a sequal and what might happen.
0	They author must have put this in the story to show change. For all giving things is we give we do e them we replemise the author. People dont think about the small damages, there nuste comrade with the big changes. The small ones count the turnig sioteero &amp; I have to bind as for. On top of that the old anges to drive. We all go through harsh big &amp; small, but we need to over come them all
7	Dear Local Newspaper, I agree with the experts when they say people are spending too much time on the computers. The reason for this is that one, people don't get enough exercise. Two, new websites have been made and people want to see how @CAPS1 works. Three, more and more teenage kids have the new technology. Their on @CAPS1 all the time, and don't realize their not spending any time with their family. Now that you know that lets move on to my first reason. First of all, people are spending a lot of time on the computer they don't have time to go outside and exercise, More people probably figure they don't need to go outside. Really they do, @CAPS1's important that they get their body moving and blood flowing through their body. Another thing is that we don't always need to get the answers off the computer. @CAPS1's east to find friend and play a game with them. Find something to do other than play games on the computer. Now that you know let's move on the second reason. Second of all, the computer network came up with new ideas for the computer. They now have facebook. More and more people use facebook now. This right here shows us they won't get out and play, this also means most kids won't do their homework. Another thing is that either parents set a time on the computer or they take @CAPS1 a way. Their is just so much amount of time you can be on the computer for and not get bored. Now that you know that lets move on to the last reason. Third of all, I would like to say people are spending more time on the computer than with their own family. The reason I say this is because @CAPS1 is important to spend as much time with family and friends instead of being on the computer @NUM1. We need to know also what's going on in our daily life. Another thing is that our family is way better than some game on the computer go outside with you family and play a game of wiffle ball. Now that you know that lets moves on to the conclusion. In conclusion, You have read an essay talking about how people spend more time on the computer rather than go outside to exersice, new website to keep them on longer, and not spending enough time with their family and friends. @CAPS1 is important to have a time limite on the computer and get up and moving. Don't be a lazy couch potato and sit on the computer all day get out and spend time with you family and friends, I hope you agree with me. 
1	This is a very important paragraph for the narrator to put in the story. For instance, Saeng is saying that her new home with her flowers is more important than school and a test. And, saeng doesn’t have many friends go see at school but her hibiscus will remind her of all of her old friends she made. Saeng is simply stating to herself that once everything is back to normal or the way she wants to she it then she can take that test again. In conclusion, the narrator used this paragraph to let us know how saeng feels.
1	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it concludes, and wraps up the story. It shows the relationship between nature, adapting, and how this all calmed her down after failing the test.
0	The author concludes this story with a sentence like this because at the end of winter into spring the snow will melt and the trees and flowers will blosom into different colored flowers. After all the flowers had blosomed the leaves had come out and then the pollin had found the right kind of trees . At the end of @DATE2 into fall the leaves start to die and change color then the leaves will fall off. Then it snows all over again.
3	The author concludes the story with the paragraph, “When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, When the snows melt ant the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again,” because it shows That Saeng isn’t going to stay down. It shows That The hibiscus will overcome winter, like Saeng’s mother says,“'…but its strong enough to make it Through the cold months here, This winter hibiscus That’s what matters.” This symbolizes Saeng overcoming not only failing The driver’s test, but also moving to @LOCATION1. She isn’t The same as she was back home, but she’s strong enough to get Through This change in her life. Also, taking The test in the spring symbolizes starting over, when everyThing is new, and she has overcome her winter. This ending paragraph is so important because it shows Saeng’s promise to herself That she will get past The challenges in front of her, and @CAPS1 to come. When Saeng says “...When the snows melt...” it symbolizes The time in her life when her failures will become good again. She will take The test with a new out look on her life. The author concludes The story with This paragraph because it shows That Saeng isn’t going to stay down.
1	The author concludes the story with this paragraph. “Where Saeng vowed silently to herself,” in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscun is budding, then I will take that test again. Minpong Ho did so because she failed the test. Saeng failed to fine the fine–toothed comb, the hibiscus hedge, the well, and her gentle grandmother. Apperantly this things could be found after the snows melt and the geese reture and hibiscus is budding.
3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show Saeng’s outlook on the future. It is a fitting conclusion, drawing from numerous elements in the story, and it shows how Saeng has grown. Saeng refers to “When the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding.” In this phrase she shows a growing acceptance and even an affection for her new homeland. The geese are “familiar to Saeng now “ despite her thinking of them as “strange before.” The hibiscus is a piece of her past, adapted to fit her current situation. Saeng’s vow that she will “take that test again” in the spring, “When the snows melt…”etc. This shows that despite losing so much - her home, her grandmother, her way of life - Saeng is still determined to make the best of her situation. She plans on passing her driving test come spring, no matter what. The concluding paragraph is a fitting way to wrap up the story. It was how the thrends of Saeng’s past and her present are entwined , and displays her attitude towards the future. With its optimistic words the final paragraph nearly ties up the mood of optimism amidst regret. The author’s wording was very well done.
1	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because in the story it says &quot;I will take that test again.&quot; So she's trying to say she will she how much she have adjusted to changes in life. In the story it also states &quot;when they come back&quot; That concludes that when the flower's come back next season. She will she how much she reminber about her homeland, her grandma and the good things.
1	The reason  why the author concludes the story with this paragraph is because they wanted the reader to know there will be another story that will be made up. Also to show that Saeng was not happy that the snow melted and the geese return and the hibiscus was budding.
0	Now that she knows a lot about plants the narrator makes it seem like the girl is interested in @CAPS1.R.@CAPS1. The new world and different plants that bloom and look so beautiful in the season so the way I see it is that the girl really enjoys the plants and the characteristic to me I say she is an adventurous girl who likes to explore new worlds and see what is out there to be explained.
1	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because it shows that Saeng can over come her weaknesses and succeed in her newhome. What the @CAPS1 “In the spring, when the snows melt and geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” It means she’ll try the @CAPS2 Test again try new test to make her like wheres she’s at and what she can @CAPS3 from it.
8	Dear Local Newspaper, I agree with the concerned experts, im sure many others agree also. I bet you that if you keep reading it would be understandable, why I agree. First of all, too many people spend to much time talking with friends online. I think that once you start talking with them online, finish up the conversation face to face or by telephone. Talking online is a great way to connect with friends and people you haven't seen in a long time, but too much of that can start problems. For example rumors. In my opinion when friends get to excited online they decide to start rumors about other people and it ends up being sent to almost everybody. Another example is online arguing which can lead up to many problems like fighting when you get back to school. How would you feel if you turned on your computer and find out that someone has been talking about you or that someone is trying to start a fight with you? I'm positive that you would not enjoy it and your feeling might be hurt. Next reason is, being on the computer too much can effect most peoples grades. Many people are going home and turning on their computer instead of doing their homework or studying. There are many people who go to my school and their grades have declined because of online usage. Pretty soon many people will be held back because they have failed the school year. For example, picture yourself as a parent and getting your child's report card and find out they have all @CAPS1's or mostly @CAPS2's. You wouldn't like that either. Lastly, computers have cause another problem called bullying. Too many children are being bullied online and they are being hurt. Those children who are being the bullies are enjoying it while the children who are getting bullied are sad. Thinking that nobody cares about them. Bullying has caused death or many other problems. Imagine, being someone, getting bullied and your feelings are really hurt, you dont talk to an adult or a parent all you end up doing is killing yourself. Picture how many parents are upset and how yours would be too to find that their child has been bullied to death, it really hurts them. And i'm sure if you were one of those parents you wont be too happy. In conclusion, being online too much has an effect on everybody and
1	The author concludes the story with this paragraph for many reasons. The first reason is to show that Saeng is determined young girl. By vowing to take the “test” again, she shows she is determined and not giving up. Another reason is because the author wanted to ampasize the importance of the idea of Saeng personality.
2	Minfong Ho concluded the story with this because it shows Saeng‘s determination to pass the drivers test. The fact that she failed it made her feel bad, and brought out feelings of homesickness as did the familiar plant, but in this final paragraph she vows that she will overcome all her challenges of being in an unfimiliar place and pull herself together to accomplish her goal as did the winter hibiscus.
2	The author included this sentence in the paragraph because Saeng was a very determined girl. She would keep trying till she got it right. No matter how long or hard it would be she would get it done. Just like from the picture of the Hibiscus flower next to the highway. It certainly woked out of place, but it would do anything to survive. Being strong at times when you can only depend on yourself is hard to do, but Saeng is determined from her loss and the perfection of the Hibiscus flower.
3	In the concluding statement Saeng states that “when they come back In the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again.” The author concludes the story with this passage because she is using the hibiscus as an example of survival. The hibiscus isfrom another place like her, and she is using it to represent her well being in the new place. In a way she is saying , If the hibiscus survives this winter, than so will I. I believe she uses this as a conclusion to depict her unsure nature towards her new home.
1	I believe the author uses this as the last paragraph because it tells of how Saeng wants to overcome and be strong even though. She misses her home. For example Saeng believed that since she cried when she saw the hibibiscus plant she failed and she believes she will get stronger over time.  
3	The author concludes the story with this specific paragraph to sum up the realization and determination Saeng obtains. First of all, Saeng starts out upset after failing her test. When she sees the flower and goes to find it at a shop she is overwhelmed by this small reminder of her old home. That small flower made her realize how much she missed her old home and buying it becomes a nessesity for her. She probably felt that with that flower she would always have a little piece of home in this newer world. After realizing that memories are whats  important and seeing that flower’s determination to survive a cold winter, she develops the determination to take the test again. She vows to do so because she has gained faith from the flower’s survival and her realization of important memories. All in all ,that ending paragraph reveals these specific messages
2	The  reason  the author was inspired was because of the flower. The flower had the ability to survive harsh winters and adapt to and new environments. She decides that she was going to over comes its obstacles just as the flower over comes its obstacles every winter.
2	Memory,promise,life-all are ideas that explain why the author concludes the  story with this paragraph.Memories is one  idea that helps explain why the author concludes this story  with  this paragraph because saeng misses her old life and country.Promise is another idea because saeng makes a vow that once spring comes again she will take the test again.Life is another idea because saeng brought the flower and planted soit can live once spring has come and she said  the n she will  retake the test. Memories, promise, and life help explain why the author conclude the story with this paragraph. Memories will come back in the spring along with the promises she has made and the that wants to start and saeng is doing this by pla nting the hibiscus which brings back a lot of her memories from her life
0	The author concludes the story with that statement because it had gotten colder and all the plants and flowers were going to die.
1	Resons I think the author concludes the saying at the top. I think he concludes the becus she was vary eger on passing the test. She told her self and she vowed to take the test again when the geese return and the snow melsts. Another reson I think the author concludes this is becus she faled it the first time and it is a big thing for her and she is vary eger on passing it. That is why I think the author added this to the story.
12	Dear @CAPS1 of @LOCATION1, @CAPS2 the world having a network where people can connect, learn and work efficently. This wonderful network is here in our computers. Computers benefit society because they help @CAPS3 connect with far-away places, develop hand-eye coordination and get work done faster. In the days before computers we were isolated in our immediate area. @CAPS2 being stuck in our town unaware of the rest of the world, unable to enjoy the beauty of @LOCATION3 or send help to the starving people in @LOCATION2. @PERCENT1 of money donated to @ORGANIZATION1 an organization that assists in global disasters comes from online. Without the computer how would our willing people help the rest of the world, or even know about the rest of the world? Give our community the ability to reach out to the farthest parts of the globe, give them computers. Computers produce games and activities more intense than you can find anywhere else. Playing baseball simply doesn't require enough focus. The computer's intricate experience helps future engineers or even pilots develop a focus and hand-eye coordination that could save lives. @PERSON1, who trains the @CAPS3 air force weighs in on the effects of computers. &quot;They have made a great deal of positive impact.&quot; he states. &quot;@CAPS4 soldiers have excellent eyes for controls and amazing reflexes, making them natural pilots.&quot; @CAPS5't our community have the opportunity to excel as well? The computers we own train @CAPS3 as we use them to have reflexes and hand-eye coordination equal to the best of the military. Computers allow our lives to be just as enjoyable as they are meaningful by getting our work done faster. Before computers @CAPS7 and calculating took @PERCENT2 more time but now they get our work done quickly and without error. @NUM1 year old author @PERSON2 states &quot;@CAPS4 computer helps me type @CAPS4 writing a lot faster and it is done right more importantly.&quot; @CAPS7 and typing is just more efficent when you are using a computer accountants, students and even the journalists for your own newspaper need the computer to work faster and more efficently. Don't stunt our community's workers, give them what they need computers! Computers are too important and beneficial to lose. Our community benefits from the computers that help @CAPS3 connect with far away places, give @CAPS3 hand-eye coordination and help @CAPS3 work quickly and correctly. So explain in your next article that we need our computers. Computers are necessary in our community and we would be last without them!
2	In the story “Winter Hibiscus”, Saeng had failed her drivers test and as she is walking home she spies a flower that reminds her of what once her home. She buys the flower and returns to her new home to her mother who is working in the garden. They decide to plant the flower in the garden, and when the flower was planted, a flock of geese fly over head, Saeng then realizes that everything is familier to her now, when everything was quite strange to her. She concludes the story saying when the geese come back in the spring, she will take the test again. She says that the flower will be buckling which means blooming or growing, and she will have been grown and familiar to everything then, so she will be ready for the test when the geese as ready to come home and the hibiscus is ready to bloom
1	The author does this because they are comparing to the plant. The author does this because when the plant starts to bloom then the character’s confidence will come back. The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it gives the story some meaning.
1	The Author concludes this story With the @CAPS1 paragraph to emphasize the story and make it seem more interesting as to make the reader want the story to keep going on to find out what happens next.
1	I think this Author put this last paragraph in this story is to show everyone how determined she is to pass this test and how much it means to her to do it so that is what I think Why the Author Would put this in the story 
3	The  author  concludes  the  story  of  paragraph  with the paragraph because it show the connection of nature and the girl. The paragraph says,”…when the snow  melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then  I will take that test again”(No @NUM1).In spring when all of these events take place. Spring is the  sign  of  life  and  birth  or  renewal. The geese come back. They are “renewed” in a symbolic sense. When the snow melts you can see the grass again which is a sign of life. When plants bud they are born. The  character  decides  when  nature  is symbolically reborn  and  renewed she  will start again just like nature.
1	he concludes the sTory  with his paRagRaph because he wanted To say That he was going To Take The Test again when it was not The winTeR @CAPS1 and show how saeng vowed to heRself By saying that he oR she will take The Test again when it is not winTeR because even @CAPS2 the Test was not passed in winteR and could have been passed duRing when TheRe snow melted in the gRound
0	In the story the author included that concluding paragraph because if you had read the rest of the story you would know that the person was talking about when she comes back that she wanted to take the test again because it would be such nicer weather then it was the first time she took it, another reason why I believe the author added this conclusion paragraph at the very end of the novel is to show the reader if they really did understand the novel and what she was really going for in the novel. So the author first wanted to make shore the reader would understand the ending of the book better with that conclusion paragraph at the end. These are the reason why I think the author added that concluding paragraph at the very end of that novel.
0	Because they wanted to get it done with so they made the end like the first part of the story I like the part when the birds came back they got some of the flower come back to them.
2	Saeng and her mother have to be determined to try their best in order to survive. Saeng and her mother has been thourgh a lot and when she failed the @CAPS1 test, she was more depressed than before, The author concludes this story with this paragraph to give readers the thought oF how it is to be determined to adapt and survive in a different place and though Saeng and her mother are away from their homeland they still enjoy the things they did in Vietnam, like the flowers, and the hot peppers and bitter melons, her friends disagree with the taste but it doesnt stop her from enjoying what she loves most.
2	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because it shows that she will not stop trying and one day she will pass that test. She made a vowe to herself that is show determination to overcome. It @MONTH1 also make us want to read make and find out if she test her vowe and if she passed the test. For example it ends in “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibsiscus is budding, then I will return and take the test again.
10	Dear The @ORGANIZATION1, Computers are out! The effects of over-use on a computer can severely change a persons life! People who are spending too much time on their computer will most likely spend less time exercisizing enjoying nature, and interaction with their family member and friends. I believe that the act of computers overwhelming a person's life should be with in a serious manner. Exersizing, an essential part of anyone's life, since the development of the internet forty years ago, the average @CAPS1 or body mass inter of an average person has increased fifteen percent! This is no coinfidence, computers are causing more and more people to challenge themselves to nex that extra mile, or swim that extra lap, and instead so home and play on their computers. This not only is hurting peoples' weights, but excersize equipment store owners are having to close their shops, because less and less people are coming into work out, or excersize like they should everyday! Our children are also being affected by this addicting sensation, childhood obesity is one of the main effects on children, because when they get heard playing on these they as well stop excersizing, and play videogames . The average amount of people who went to @LOCATION2 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 every year was around @NUM1, but since the invention of the computer that the attendance dropped to a more @NUM2 people every year. Less and less people are to enjoy a fresh @DATE1 and instead spend it indoors on their country. This is hurting people as well as the wildlife around them. The rates of squirrels to people in @LOCATION2 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 was @NUM3 in @DATE2, the year the computer has invented. But a mere ten years later, the changed so now their are squirrels! This is because now that they less people feeling less squirrels live in the @CAPS3 @CAPS3, went live in the to find food by themselves. Tour guides who worked in @LOCATION2 @CAPS2 @CAPS3, we being fired, due to less people wanting a tour, so less tour guides are needed. Families are seeing that the more a person plays on a computer, the less time that person is going to spend talking to @LOCATION1, or @CAPS4 @CAPS5. Scientists held to have three different people spend an hour reading a book, another spend an hour on a computer, and three hours on a computer to see who could stay in a conversation with their mother the longest. The first person spent twenty minutes on the phone with their mother, the second only ten minutes, and the last, a mere five minutes. This shows that the mere time spent on a computer, the less interactions are held between son and mom, an important relationship in any one's life. Mother's worry that the next time they have a barbeque, @PERSON1 won't be in his room, playing on his computer like last time. @PERSON2 was chosen to conduct an experiment on @PERSON2 had three freinds @CAPS6, @PERSON3, and
0	The Author concluded the story like this because she had another view of Saeng. He would think that every season that she would be in a different mood @CAPS1 that the garden would change so that Saeng mom would alway be out side for every season.
3	The author concludes this story with the paragraph because she is proving how something from a memory can make someone determined. For example, saeng failed her driver’s test but upon reaching the hibiscus plant, it reminded her of her old home. Also, while she is planting the plant, she sees the geese with a new familiarity. This combined makes her determined to complete her test because having two reminders of both homes, it comforts her to know that she can adapt easily and treasure her memories as well.
1	he was saying that you should not give up and that you should keep trying like the plants in the spring time.
1	The author concludes the story with that paragraph, because she is making a promise to herself to take the test again so she can pass it. She will do it when it is spring with the hibiscus is budding. She need to take the test and start driving. I think that is a good thing to when people vowed thing to themself.
0	He is referring to the lifestyle of Saeng and the stuff they do. And what the area is like weather wise.
0	The author decided to finish the story with that phrase to show that she will wait for her next year and do all this over again. She will be waiting for it and do all this over again. She will be waiting for it and prove that she can do it one more time and that she is used to live there now.
1	the author conclude this story like that to show a new beginning in the spring. Like how flowers bloom and bud in spring she will become a new better person. that why the author conclude the story like this.
2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show that Saeng will try the test again and get a fresh new start.  Also I think that its showing the reader if you fail something the first time don’t be afraid to go back and try it again. I also think that the hibiscus symbolizes her because she failed the test in the winter and doesn’t like what shes in. But in the spring when the hibiscus has buds on it shes going to have a fresh start on the test and the flower will have a new environment to survive in.
1	The author concluded the story with that paragraph because it leaves you to interpret and decide. It doesn’t come out  and tell you what the test was for or even if she passed it, that’s for you to decide. It also leaves you wondering what is going to happen until then. The ending to the story can be anything you want it to be, it is up for interpretation. To different people it could mean different things.
1	The author ended the story with that paragraph because that paragraph says when she is going to try to take the test and make changes in her changing life. For example she is sad in the story because she failed the test and want to go home. If she passes in the spring she might try to make changes and live here. This is why the author concludes the story with that paragraph.
8	I walked outside to get the mail and newspaper. I saw the front page talking about computer. An article said, too much computer using. I though there wasn't going to sell more computer but, it said that people are using computers and are not exercising much. I think that people are not going to have a hard time quitting to use their computer. I had a friend that didn't know how to use the computer. He past his hour playing outside. In the @DATE1 he tries out for @CAPS1 baseball. He is a very good athlete. He does grate in school too. Others people without a gob are not looking for something 'to do they are at the computer everyday. When they should be doing work around and inside the house. Peoples with computers shouldn't be all day like these friend my friend haves is using his computer everytime he comes from school. He don't do his homework on time. Every time he doesn't want to go out and exercise his mind or get a little bit of sun he sometimes don't eat so he should give his brain a rest and do physical things that will help them. Other person such as the computer workers should write a note to people with computer saying how computer can be addicted to people and maybe realize how much often they should use their computer and was using it to go to get information and to collage. She started to use the computer to chat with people and ended up using the computer a lot and not going to collage. I believe that computers are an major impact on people. People should be going about to have fun get sunlight not staying at the computer all the time. Many adults don't use the computer is most the teens and kids. People should go to the gym and build strong muscles. They should stay away from computer for a time. Agains computer would be the right thing to do.
3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show that Saeng is Finally comfortable with her new “home.” After the passage is mostly a reflection of Saeng’s old life, it ends this way to signify that she has become accustomed to her new way of life. For example, it says “in the spring, and the geese return…” that shows that she is now used to the geese and the nature of her new world. The author also uses that paragraph at the end to show a sense of release. Saeng had so many memories locked inside her old life, that she couldn’t grasp new ones in her new home. The authors use of this paragraph is a good way to close out the story because it lets the reader feel the relaxed scene of the birds flying away; Saeng escaping  her pain and becoming  a real part of her new world.  
3	This last paragraph reveals something special to the reader. Saeng was given new hope winter mothers understanding and the hibiscus plant. She felt hopeless, miserable and incomparable upon seeing the hibiscus that reminded her of her homeland. When she came home, however, seeing the roots of the plant buried in the ground gave her new determination. The flower represents her. It adapted to be able to survive in cold weather, or hard times, in Saeng's case. The roots are her past and although they are buried, they are not forgotten. The actual flower represents a new life for Saeng in a new country .The author, Minfong Ho, gave personification or human–izing to non-living things to the story. This is why the author used the last paragraph then why she did.
2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph inorder to show Saeng’s determination. It is also relating the drivers test to the hibiscus plant. It is saying that when everything else starts coming to life, she will also accomplish something. She needs the motivation of her surroundings to push her. Throughout the story, Saeng is affected by her surroundings. For example, when she’s in the greenhouse, it takes her back to her childhood, “It was like walking into another world. A hot, most world exploding with greenery.... Plants that she had not even realized she had known but had forgotten drew her back to into her childhood world.”
2	In the story &quot;Winter Hibiscus&quot; Saeng finds comfort in the plant after she failed her test. The plant reminds her of home and connects her with her past experiances. Even though she failed the test the first time she feels that if she studies and trys again she can pass. This connects to the Hibiscus because in the winter the plant dies but then come spring its pretty and blossoms again. Saeng feels a connection with the plants rebirth and feels she can start over again to and do well on the test. That is why the author includes the paragraph that Saeng vowes to take the test again when the spring comes and the hibiscus blossoms.
1	The @CAPS1 why the authoR concludes the story saying, &quot;when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to heRselF, in the spRing, when the snows melt and the geese REtuRn and this bibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.&quot; The authoR ended it like that, because Saeng basically saying time will come FoR heR  to take that test and she will past it with belieF in heRselF,
2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph as a way to say that in due season she will take the test that she failed in the belief that the hibiscus will help her to overcome the obstacles. I believe that she she bought the plant when she failed the test, that she hope that with the blossoming of the plant, I will give her a time table as to when she is ready to try again.
2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it is a meaningful summary of the events in the story. Everything that happed to Saeng  while she was at the florizd  is summed upinto  something resembling vengeance. The whole reason that Saeng was sad in the first place was that she failed her driving test. In the final paragraph, she vows to take the test again when the hibiscus buds. The hibiscus that Saeng  bought will begin budding in the spring, when the snows melt. The last paragraph of the story gives roem for Saeng to dealhtith her nostalgiaover the winter season. Finally, the  geese that fly south make Saeng feel sad, but they light a spark within her she tells herself that she will take the driving test again when the geese return, when the hibiscus buds, and when the snows melt. 
1	In the last paragraph they trying to express what is coming. When winter is over spring will come which means the hibiscus will come back and it will be like home. Also the geese will return and because of that she will take the quiz again. To her it’s like starting all over and hopefully she will pass. Also she loves the hibiscus and seamce thats back maybe she will do so much beter. Overall a new time is coming.  
3	I think the author of “Winter Hibiscus” finished with &quot;when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt, and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again, “because it is showing us the importance of the plant and how it will help her pass. It also symbolizes that when the plant buds and fights all the obstacles to survive, then she will beat the obstacles to past her driving test. For example, in the story it says &quot;When the snows melt and then geese return” the author is relating thats to Saeng and her struggle to pass her test with these struggle in surive the winter. It also says “Like the geese. She lifted her head and watched as their distinctive I was etches against the evening sky, slowly seeing into the distance”. This quote is saying she will rise to her challenge, and overcome it. All in all, this quote &quot;when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is holding then I will take that test again”, because it is showing the similar struggles between the flower, Saeng and the geese to overcome their challenges and finish what thing started.
2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it has meaning. The author is saying that when these animals and living creatures get their chance she too, will get hers. For example, the geese will get to return, the hibiscus will get it's chance to bud and she will get her chance to take her drivers test. I know this because Saeng’s mother starts talking about how great the plant will be in the spring. She even says, “But its strong enough to make it through the cold months”. This indicates that the mom is trying to tell her that she will get a second chance. That is why the story ends with that sentence.
9	Dear Newspaper @CAPS1, @CAPS2 opinion on computers is that they have a positive affect on people. I think this because I know some people that excersise and go on the computer mainly, I don't think computers are a bad thing. Some people learn on computers. They learn how to exercise. Sure some people just chat and learn about that far away place they could go there and explore the buety and nature. I think computers are great effects on people, They help out a lot. I know @CAPS2 uncle that came from @LOCATION1 he learned how to speak english of the computer. He learned a lot and we were all proud. Some effects that computers have on people are a lot. People have classes online they go to @CAPS3 mothers that are single that have kids for example, they get their diplomas and degrees of the computer online. And theirs other @CAPS3 @CAPS2 aunts and uncles they go to english classes online and work. A lot of people have classes online. @CAPS3 i go on @PERSON1 all the time all the time. @CAPS4 teaches me how to type. @CAPS4's fun, but also educated. I think that all computer have positive effects on people. All of them should their should'nt be one computer with negative effects on people. But that's only by @CAPS2 opinion. Computers are @CAPS3 robots they do lots for us. We type reports, learn, read online. And then theres also were we play games online, and educated games. I believe that their are lots of resources. You could search up a lot of stuff. For example you could search up: mistery, animals, natures and places. You wouldn't beleive how many results the computer has. So who would have negative effects of the computer. All @CAPS4's trying to do is help us and out education @CAPS4 helps me with @CAPS2 spanish sometimes. So why would people think that computers arn't good ideas? Computers are great for everything. I could go on and see what the weather is for tommorrow. Also I could see what the news are, and i could contact @CAPS2 teachers through the computer. I think a computer would always have a positive affect on people.
1	Why the author concluds the story with ths paragraph because its telling the seasons and how they change and how they come and go and they start of with a new season then its something different. An I think thats why the title of this story was called Winter Hibiscus cause after spring is winter &amp; when it was spring they have all the nice beautiful flower thats smell good. An when spring gone its winter so all the plants had died out they not going to be the same how they used to be.
2	In “Winter Hibiscus,” by @CAPS1 Ho, Saeng does not give up, she keeps trying. The author concludes the story with a small paragraph that has an extraordinary meaning. “…in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again,” by saying this, Saeng shows to never give up, to give new things a fair chance, and to always remember her homeland. The author ended the story in such an inspiring way because it strengthens the theme. There is a lot to be learned from only a few words.
3	The author chose to end the story with the final paragraph for several reasons. Saeng states that she will retake her driving test in the spring. Archetypically, spring symbolizes a new start or new opportunity. Ending the story with this archetype shows that later on, Saeng has a new chance to succeed at her test and also to make the best of being in @LOCATION1 and adapt to her new life. When she buys the hibiscus plant, she remembers her old home and all the wonderful memories she has of it. The plant seems to give her hope and the last paragraph of the story mentions the hibiscus. This shows that having the hibiscus around will give her hope of passing her test and also of adjusting to @LOCATION1 while remembering her old home in Vietnam
1	The author concludes the sentence on the end to state when the plants start over growing and the geese come back, she will try again. For example, the plants have to grow their pedals back and the geese have to make their home and find food again. The author is saying she will take the test again when the geese come back and the plants grow again.
0	The author wrote the paragraph because she went back in side the house to get a dinner and because ain’t going to see the garden until the other day and because the winter come and she will not play outside anymore until the winter goes. Like she said “In the spring when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again”. That quotation explain why the author concludes the story with this paragraph.
0	I would have to say that the reason that the narrator ended with this is because it is kind of a solution if you think about it. And you don’t put the solution any whereelse but the end that is why she put it there.
1	The author concludes the story with this paragraph bY the author shows that Saeng is not giving up and that she found a hobby to look forward too An example “the winter hibiscus was in the ground now and Saeng tamped down the soil around it overhead at lock of Canada geese flew by”, That why the author cludes the story with this paragraph.
3	The author ended the story with that specific quote because it shows the grasp in understanding the beauty &amp; marvels of nature. Saeng spent a lot of money to buy a distinct flower called dok faeng-nol. Saeng was taking a driver's test a liscence but was failing it, and during her test she found that plant. Ashamed that she failed the test, she still showed her mother the flower she found, which was not like the one at home. Her mother is pleased with the flowers and understands that Saeng failed her test. Her mother said about the flower, “Its flowers aren’t as pretty, but it’s strong enough to make it through the cold months here, this winter hibiscus. That what matters that was a figurative speech that there's hope for Saeng to pass her test again when she her learned more refined and is ready to try again. And with the geese flying away for the winter and coming back in the spring signifies a fresh new start at success.
0	The author concludes this way because when it gets warm and nice outside that they will go to take the test again cause it is to nosty outside now.
3	It is actually a very powerful last statement, Even though she failed her driver’s test, she has realized that she will just have to keep being strong and be patient. Soon the geese will come back and the snow will melt, and she will “return” to take her test and will  be determined to pass. Saeng  bought the hibiscus to feel as if she were back in Vietnam, and felt as if it could fill that place in her heart were she misses it. “I paid nineteen dollars for  it”. She  says it like she was disappointed  in failing the  test but also that saying which is free back in vietnam was so expensive in the united states. A hibiscus flower is tropical so when it blooms in the spring will be when she becomes ready to give the test a second try.
9	Dear Local @CAPS1, I am deligted to write this letter to you. It has come to my attention that the people who support advances in tecnology believe that computers have a positive efffect on people. I agree with those people. I agree with them because one: you can communicate with your family and friends via email, via @CAPS2, via @CAPS3 ets. Number two: you can use a computer for research, and number three: it can tell you directions or give you info. on a resteraunt or place you want to go. I will now get into more detail on these three topics. You can communicate with your family or friends via computer. For example my friend amor, when we were best freinds and we were in third grade, he had to move to @LOCATION1. I cried the first day he moved. then the next week or so I got an email from him and so now we can keep in touch with each other. He comes &amp; to @LOCATION2 every @DATE2 and we hangout with each other. Maybe one day, I will like to go visit him now In @LOCATION3 becasue he moved again, but I will have to do some research on @LOCATION3 first. With a computer you can research alot of things like this year our language @CAPS4 class read a book called &quot;my brother @CAPS5 is dead&quot; and it was a true story. Se we had to some research on the book and I found out that without computers how would I be able to research anything on the website it shared where everything , a description of the thing, and how to get there (diretions). Directions are very important. The show you how to get to a certain destination. You can get directions off a computer. I remember one year I had to go to my friends birthday party and we didn't know how to get there. So I went online on @DATE1 and we got the directions from there and we printed them out and we found the place in @NUM1 minutes. Without a computer we would have been able to find the house easily. You @MONTH1 disagree with me on this because a computer can have bad websites and can also became very addicting to some people, but I think I am right. Thank you for reading this letter, once again computers are good for the study!
2	The author concludes the story with this endding because it shows that if the plant comes back and blooms then she will go back and take the test and try to pass this time. She knows that it is going to be tough for her to come back and pass this test but she knows she can do it just like she knows that the plant will fight through the winter and come back and bloom in the spring. This gives her confidence that she can pass this test if the plant can come through the tough winter that they are going through. As a result, this is why the author ended the story with that.
3	In my opinion, the author concludes the story by saying that she will retake the drivers test because not only will she take the drivers test again, but she will also be more comfortable in her life. The drivers test is not the main problem, it’s adapting to her new environment that is causing Saeng so much heartache. For example,  in lines @NUM1 Saeng’s thought’s are &quot;A wave of loss so deep and strong stang Saeng‘s eyes now and swept over her “and” in the warm moist shelter of the greenhouse, Saeng brake down and wept.” This piches that Saeng is having trouble readjusting to her new life and is reminded of her old memories from where she used to live and cries because it’s gone. I think that failing her drivers test was just little thing that finally caused her to cry because of the stress, and when she said  “and this hibiscus is budding, I will take that test again.” It means that she will overcome all that and move on.
1	It was good that the author concluded the story with this paragraph. Saeng loved the hibiscus so when spring come and the hibiscus would bloom it would  be the best time to take that test again from already failing it. It would probably make her more confident to take the driving test again at the right time. So in conclusion that’s why the author concludes that paragraph in the story
2	The author concludes the story with this because she is say that she is going to grow with the season chang. She is in a new country and just failed her drivers test. She feels down but the hibiscus reminds her of being back home. In the story @CAPS1 mother says “I’ve seen this kind blooming along the lake its strong enough to make it through the winter. I think that Saeng can relate to that because if the flower can make it in the winter tha she can make it in a new country.
2	In the story “Winter Hibiscus&quot;, the auther finishes the story with this last paragraph, “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is building, then I will take that test again. The auther finishes the story with that paragraph because in the beginning, Saeng had purchased hibiscus plant because it had reminded her of her hometown. (“Plants that she had not realized that she had known but had forgotten drew her back into her childhood world”) So she purchased it, but since there was bad weather at the time, Saeng had to get the plant back in time and plant it in the graden. But she failed setting if there on time. That is why it says “I will take that test again&quot;. And she will take it again during the spring when the hibiscus blooms once again. That is why the auther finished the story with that paragraph.
1	The author concludes the paragraph like this because it shows that she @MONTH1 not going to give up. I @MONTH1 this because she vowed silently to herself that she was going to take the test again during the spring, also, it was the aiudieres not the gains in old years seeds an ezing. In conclusion they one the reason why the author concludes the paragraph like this.
2	The story “Winter Hibiscus” is written by Minfong Ho. The author ended the story with this excerpt, ”When they come back, ‘Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again.” The reason for this is so she will have time to adjust. Saeng just needs a little comforting because all of this is new to her. This words use figurative language because the geese reminded her of herself, “Almost familiar to her now. Like geese.&quot;  
0	It is all most sping like he said show melting and geese return and hibiscus is buding. Grass is growing tree are buding, @CAPS1 are singing
2	In the story “Winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho, the author concludes the story with an interesting paragraph. The paragraph says” When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding  then I will take that test again. &quot;The author ended the story with that paragraph because she was not in her comfort zone, she had move to a new country and missed everything like the flower and the Hibiscus. So she would wait until she felt at home and comfortable again to retake the test. In the text it states “through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now.” She was realizing that it wasn’t so bad &amp; she was getting used to it.
0	The author concludes the story with this paragraph, “When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself in the spring, when the snows melt &amp; the geese return &amp; this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,” so that the audience has something to think about, it gives the story a little more of a dramatic effect.
8	Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 you know that computers can prevent you from doing a lot of things? Instead of going on the computer you can exercise more, play outside, and spend more time with family and friends. This is why you need to spend less time on the computer. Exercise is important to your body and computers are not. you can get some weights and exercise in your room. A run out the beach doesn't sound bad either. Just by doing that you lose a lot of weight and not gaining weight on the computer. So go exercise and lose weight because it's good for you! Computers also prevent you from getting freash air and playing outside. When your are outside you see that playing is much better than just pressing buttons and clicking everywhere. On the computer. You don't even have to play outside, you can just walk with someone or just sit on the grass and talk. The computer prevents you from doing all of this fun activities outside. Spending time with your family is a huge activity that your computer is prevting you to do. You are on the computer for an hour and your family is having a barbeque. You finally get off that computer and you realize that spending time with them is so much fun than sitting down and looking at the screen. this is why computer are a distraction to everyone because you don't want to exercise, play outside, or spend time with the family. you can use the computer but just don't stay on to long because you are missing the fun.
1	The author concludes the story this way to show she will be alright, and remain determined. The way she speaks of future times shows confidence that she will make it till spring. The way she speaks of the test shows her determination. The use of the word “vowed” shows she will follow through with her statement.
0	The author concluded the story with this sentence because shes letting people know that she enjoys nature more than school.
0	The author concludes this story with this paragraph because the flower is told about all through the story and the author puts when the hubiscius is budding then I will take that test again.
0	The author concludes this story with this paragraph because she is telling us what will happen beyond the story we are reading. It means when the snow melts, she’ll start all over again and rebuild the greenhouse.
2	I think the author concludes the story the way she did to show determination. I also believe that it symbolizes adaption, when the season changes, as will Saeng, she will take the test again. Everything will soon go back to normal and will adjust just like she will. Everything is “almost familiar to her now” (@NUM1).
1	The author concludes with this ending because it because it gives hope. It is like a happy ending to a sad story. It is also her final thought for the story and a good end point.
1	The author concludes this paragraph in the story because thats when she starts growing plants again &amp; she wants to start over again
2	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because it explains that Saeng will try again once spring comes around. For example, “I failed the test,” (Ho) shows that saeng did fail the test, but got her mother a hibiscus to plant in her garden. Her mom feels bad about Saeng failing so she cooks her food to make her feel better and try to forget about failing. This is important because it makes saeng feel a sense of comfort and relief knowing she can take the test again in confidence.
2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because of some causes. Saeng vowed silently to herself. That shows she calm down already, she feels better with her new country. She feels the snows meet, the geese return, she says that she will take that test again. It shows one that she doesn’t feel bad with the test more. She knows that she has opportunity to take it again and does it better. She has a different feeling with her problem. She looks her new country with a different eyes. All things with her become better. These are some reasons explain why the author concludes this story with this paragraph.
2	The author concludes the story with “When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,” to show that she will try again with a new start. When she see’s the flower the clerk tells her it is the hibiscus. The hibiscus brings back memories of her childhood. She then takes it home and shows the plant to her mother. Her mother replies with a “You what?” hearing her daughter tell her how much it is. With the hibiscus bringing something of importance she acquires more hope. By saying she will start once the flower has bloomed and the geese have returned, she means she will try again with a new and frash start.
9	Dear local Newspaper, @CAPS1 opinion on the affects of computers is that while there are good benefits that come out or them, I believe more strongly that negative issues and situation arise from computers and that they affect people with greater impact in a not so good way. @CAPS1 three main reason as to why I think there are more negative impacts than positive and constructive impacts from computers are @CAPS2-bullying is a very big issue. Also there are many 'scams' and 'cons' out there on the @CAPS9. Lastly there is a lot of mis-leading or wrong information online. Going back to @CAPS1 first reason, &quot;@CAPS2-bullying.&quot; @CAPS2-bullying can be derined as rude or nasty teasing over the @CAPS9. On social networking websites such as @CAPS4 @CAPS5, @CAPS6, and so on. '@CAPS2-bullying' can include teasing, hurtful comments horrible name-calling and fowl language. It is much more effective than regular bullying, such as &quot;Give me your lunch money&quot;, because once you put words out on the @CAPS9, you can never take them back, no matter how hard you try. '@CAPS2-bullying' is the new generation of mean. Secondly, scamming and cons come out of the @CAPS9/computers. When purchasing items online, you never really know what your going to get. @CAPS1 father was scammed, or connect on the @CAPS9. He was looking on what seemed like a very official site to purchase a big boat. He drove all the way to @LOCATION1 to get it. He took it out on the water in @LOCATION2, at our @DATE1 home, and the engine and motor were broken. That is what can happen when buying something off of the @CAPS9. Lastly, mis-information can be another negative impact from computers. When researching a topic, you should stick to the library, it @MONTH1 sound old-fashioned and slow, but when you research on the @CAPS9, you need to remember anybody can put or post anything, even mis-leading or untrue statements and 'information' online. Researching topics is not the only way to get false information. People can pretend to be who they are not in real-life, which is why ananymous chat-rooms and instant messaging are dangerous and un-reliable. As a conclusion, the @CAPS9 basically has stronger negative impacts and consequences than positive ones. Because @CAPS2 bullying, scamming or conning and mis-information are all negative factors of the @CAPS9, and out-wiegh the positives.
2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show Saeng’s determination despite her sadness. She misses Vietnam, but she will take the test again next year. The author’s choice of words in the concluding paragraph convey a sense of hope and something to look forward to. In the story, Saeng is disapointed in herself for failing the test, but buying the plant helps her because it reminds her of home. The idea that Saeng is persistant and the hopeful tone of the story are expressed in this final paragraph.
0	The author concluded the story with that particular paragraph because it appeared to be an important thought to &quot;Saeng&quot; and it was basically the main cause of everything rather the main subject of the story. She also @MONTH1 possibly have concluded the story with that particular paragraph because that was her last and final thought, or memory of her previous life / lifestyle before there present place of living.&quot;
0	The author concludes the story with “In the spring when the snow melts and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again” because Saeng fails the test by spending her money on a big mac and not having enough for the type of flower her mother sent for. So since Saeng failed the test, she wants to take the test again and make her mother happy.
1	 I believe that author ended the story with that sentence because it give a lifting feeling after the story was so sad. Saeng missed her homeland, was sad, used the flowers as relief, sad about her driving test and realy liked the plant. So the last sentence seemed to fit in as a confort zone to make the reader a bit more relieved. 
3	The author concludes the story with these final lines to create a tone of hope that creates a theme. Final lines have a great impact for the reader because it is the last thing they read. In this story, Saeng refers to the time “when the shows me”. Here the snow is symbolic to the sorrow she has been facing because she left home. At one point in the story, “Saeng  brokedown and wept!” The spring is a time for archetypal rebirth. However, so the “show will melt” and her sorrow will go away. This creates a tone of hope for happy times in the future. Next, saeng  refers to the time of the hibiscus budding. The hibiscus represents a comforting connection to her old country. She referred to the plant as “yet another old friend”. If the hibiscus blooms, then her new life will also because she will be comforted to the point where she feels security. This creates a tone of hope for future comfort. The times ahead she speaks of are followed by a promise to take the test again despite her failure the first time. The author is using  the ??? of hope to ??? home that??? We overcome. She is showing optimism toward the spring and is willing to face a challenge. Therefore, he ????  that to make a hopeful home . ??? a life lesson of courage.
2	The author of “Winter Hibiscus” ends the story with this paragraph because it reveals the importance of the Winter Hibiscus. In the story Saeng moves from Vietnam and feels very homesick. She fails her drivers test and is very upset. When she sees the familiar plant she is reminded of her home in Vietnam. The Winter Hibiscus reminds Saeng of fond memories with her grandmother and simple things such as her fine. Toothed buffalo-horn comb and the hibiscus hedge that would leave soft red petals in her well water. When seeing the familiar plant. “Saeng felt a shock recognition so intense, it was almost visceral. ”This shows how important the hibiscus was to her. The author ended the story with that paragraph to show how the winter hibiscus is a comfort to Saeng and will encourage her to do better on her next driver’s test.
1	After reading “Winter Hibiscus, I can tell that Saeng is a determined person, and likes nature. I can also tell that she is determined to pass the test. The author concludes the story with this paragraph because in the beginning of the story, Saeng fails her driving test. She walks home, and as she is walking, she comes across a familiar plant. This takes her to her childhood world. Have her not failed the test, she would have never walked home and come across the plant. The author didn’t want us to forget the reason she walked home. It would have never happened.
2	The author concluds the story with this paragraph to show that next spring she will have anoter chane. The author shows that Saeng will relate to the blooms or the hybiscus plant and take the test again. The author does this to leave a clif haber and it shows there is more to Saeng’s life but it is still to come. In the story Saeng is trys to get used to change and that she is have a hard time. Her moter holes cheer her up but just like the winter comes. Saeng will Have next spring to take the divers test again.
2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph &quot;When they come back,… then I will take the test again because Saeng needs time just as the hibiscus to grow. Saeng didn't do well on a test but says she will try again after snow melts and the spring comes. After moving Saeng feels alone and wants to go back home but she feels in her heart that she can try given time. The hibiscus remines Saeng of the flower back in her home country this helps her see that she has to let go of her past and live in the now.
1	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it shows saeng being mature about it and being confident knowing she can take it again. When it says “ saeng vowed silently to herself she thought about everything and the phrase is almost like she is going to start over.
7	The use of computers is definetly correct. It is helpful, you can discover new things and much more. Computers makes peoples lives just so much simpler. Computers can help people in magnificent ways by looking for things you despretly need. Like if you were a student and you had to write a paper on @PERSON1. The computer has internet and that like billions of facts @PERSON1 and much more information about every thing. It can be helpful also by looking up the wheather, the new, even things that are happening around the world and even answering questions you have. Discovering things on the computer is something that happens every day. For example I read an article about the @CAPS1 and the @CAPS2 @CAPS3 the next day my teachers gave us a pop quiz on that and I got @NUM1. If a computer can get somebad a @NUM1 on their test think of what else it could do for the world. It might even help sae lives. Of course a computer can be helpful. In way like cheeking the score from yesterdays game, see whats going on in your community, watch videoes, hear music, talk to your friends, relatives get information on places, medical stuff. A computer can basicly do every thing from looking up the games scores to saving a life. The use of computers is, obviously the best dicision.
7	Dear Newspaper, Computers are not a benfit for us because we spent to much time on them not every one has a computer and they cost of a computer. Every one dosen't know how to use it. If we timed many hours we spend on the computer people would be amazed at what they sound. People spend looking up random things when they could be outside rideing biks or going sur awalk. And you cant do that with a computer. Not everyone hase a computer because that cost so much @MONEY1 a bacik computer can cost upwards of @NUM1 and more and thats @MONEY1 sur ther computer. Then you have to pay sur the internet witch can so sur @NUM2 a month. And you have to pay for surton aps like (windos, microsoft ect.) The bill on a computer up outer a while and people dont relize that when they are payings for the internet they arnt getting allot what the cable com sars they on giving you. Not every are knows how to use a computer lik older adults dont know how to really know use the full ptonole of a computer. Because they never learnd how to use computer. In this is the computer arnt a hose help for our society.Coose of the time and the cost and the knolage on computers.
2	The author concludes the story with a sentence about retaking her test when the geese are back and the hibiscus is budding because they each represent something else. The geese represent change because they change their environment in the winter just like Saeng changes her environment by going to the plant place. The hibiscus reminds her of home because at her home there are similar plants. The hibiscus budding represents a new life just like the one Saeng has to live in a new home. Overall, the sentence that the author era’s with is used to show @CAPS1 life as compared to the geese and hibiscus.
0	Saeng was happy when the snow was disappearing because she couldn’t wait for spring to come back to see the animals running around by her garden and seeing the beautiful geese flying in after they long &amp; hard hibernation. So Saeng was excited to see everything grown back so she is guaranteed to pass the test this time
1	 The author concludes the story with this paragraph because Saeng was waiting for the winter time to be over. After the winter time, Saeng going take a test again and she can plants the flower. Saeng really like this hibicus and she doesn't want it to die on winter time.
2	The author concluded this story with this paragraph because she wanted show how the flower gave the little girl strength. The girl was in a new place and back at home where she is from there are alot of beautiful flowers that she loved to look at and being in a new place that doesn't have these flowers really gets her down and has her upset. She misses her home so she is hurting and the only thing that sort of comforts her a little bit are the flowers. For example, the girl says, “It’s-it's not a real one...I mean, not like the kind we had at...&quot;, here she stops because she is so upset that she can’t say home. The flower she has right now isn't real but when the real one blossom in the spring, seeing the flower will comfort her and give her confidence to retake the test.
1	The author’s conclusion explains her feels. The authors conclusion saids to me &quot;when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test&quot; again&quot;, what means is that she is a newoman. For example, taking the test means that she will change. Also what it means is that she ready to take on new thing. For instance, the test to her is getting ready to take on a new thing. Thats what I got from the conclusion. 
1	The author ends with this paragraph to show gthat Saeng had. Hope. It shows that there is still hope. The ending paragraph makes you  kind of create your own ending for Saeng. I like to imagine Saeng with a big garden next to her and and she passes the test.
2	I believe that the author concluded the story with this paragraph for several reasons. This final paragraph draws together and unites all the final paragraph on concluding idea. It tells us that in the spring when everything is coming to life Saeng will find the strength to take the test again. These central ideas expressed in thelast paragraph show how Saeng and her mother have adapted and that new things are started in the spring, as well as new possibilities. In the text it says, “I know&quot;, her mother said quietly. “I’ve seen this kind blooming along the lake. It’s flower aren’t as pretty, but it’s strong enough to make it through the cold months here, this winter hibiscus.” This means and represents that even though life is different here away from Saeng home they will adapt and survive in their own way.
3	The author concludes the story the way she does because it shows that Saeng   needs to heal from the failing of the test before she can take it again. Saeng already knows that she  can heal. She realizes that she has gotten used to where she now lives, that things in her new land, like the sound of geese, are now “familiar to her”. The narrator of the story says, “..she  realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become… almost familiar to her now.” Things in Saeng new home had been strange to her at first, but she had healed and gotten used to them. Saeng has also healed from leaving her original home of Vietnam. She was sad to leave her home, “ A work so deep and strong that it stung Saeng’s eyes now swept over her.”, but she had healed. Saeng  remembers the flowers that she had known in vietnam as “old friends”, showing that it did not hurt her to remember them. When Saeng heals from failing   her driving test, like she had healed when moving  from Vietnam to the united states, she can re-visit the test, without pain.
3	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because it shows the character, Saeng , was going to adapt to their new home and stay strong. I believe, when Saeng’s mother says, “Its flowers aren’t as pretty, but its strong enough to make it through the cold months here, this winter hibiscus,’’ I think Saeng’s mother is also sort of thinking about Saeng Its almost as if she’s saying that the move here scarred Saeng but she will be strong and survive the change likes anyone who has failed a test, she will study more and try hander to pass it next time. Saeng  isn’t going to give up and she’ll keep holding on to make it through Saeng knows it’s hard to adjust to changes to life’s but with a little courage and hard work, it will be a breeze. If she believes in herself, she’ll be able to get situated in this new place.
0	when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding then I will take that test again. That is in there for many reasons. One is because when winter comes and brings all the snow it kills her garden. So thats why she wants it to be spring again so she can start growing things agian in her garden. She got to take a test on the things that she is growing to make sure it is @CAPS1 for someone to eat it. Thats why I think the paragraph “when the come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.”
8	Dear @LOCATION1, Have you ever found yourself thinking about the computer, or wishing you were on it? I heard you were looking to see if computers have negitive or positive effects on society. I feel that it is a negative effect because of less time exercising littele time with family or friends, and is very it's easy to became addicted to. Exercising, a very important thing for a healthy body and mind @CAPS1 have a hard enough time finding time to do this. So instead of that free time to exercise, they will probably be on facebook. Also the maintenance of the computer will take away time for exercising. Just @DATE1, my computer got a virus I had to get fixed and that took for ever. That time while I fixed it could have been valiuble exercising time. Another key point to look at is obesity. We should be up and moving not just setting and staring at a computer for @NUM1 hours at a time. I love to spend time with my friends and family. I mean who doesn't right? Computers only away from that kids well be on facebook instant of eating a nice meal with thier family. My @CAPS2 always told me stays of the (and stupid) things he @CAPS2 with his friend. Now wkids just @CAPS3 easy. We will never have the social our parents I feel if is very important to spend time with and family because you never find when your going to lose them. Addiction is a serious matter. being addicted to the computer is too. Our generation is so dependant on computers. For example, in the car with the @CAPS4. You just plug it in and it ells you where go. What happens when it braker? You will have know idea where to go because you never learned how to read a map. or what if your computer brakes? You will have to send a better by mail kids had be typing instead of writing. that skill would be lost and you would have to learn it again. As you can see, addition is a no laughing matter. Once again I must streach the negative affect of computers to. 
2	In the story “Winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho, the author concluded the story with an interesting paragraph. It was, “When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again” (@NUM1). This shows that the girl is adapting to her new country and hopes to do better in the spring. The reson the author ended the story with this paragraph is because it shows that the girl has successfully adapted to her new country and is determined to get stronger as time goes. She is saying when the hibiscus returns, she will be ready to take the test again and not fail it.
1	The Hibiscus is budding means that the flower was growing. That is a flower with lots of bright colors and nothing else can beat it. The reason another flower can’t beat it is because that flower represents so much thing and it is one of the most natural born flowers around.
0	The author concluded the story with that paragraph because that was how he wanted the story to end. He wanted to end the story with her talking to herself.
2	People have to adapt to different cultures if they move. They could do this in a variety of ways, including making new friends and adjusting to the area. However, when adjusting to a new area, you should still remember your past home as well. This is what Minfong Ho is trying to display in the ending paragraph of the story, &quot;Winter Hibiscus”. In the story, a teenage girl named Saeng moved from Vietnam to the @LOCATION2 She has various rememberances of her past home while visiting a plant store. She buys a plant that was common in Vietnam and plants it in her garden. The last paragraph of the story says “In the spring, when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that driving test again”. This shows Saeng’s desire to fit in with this culture, by taking the driving test, as well as remember her past, by keeping the flower. This last paragraph summarizes Saeng’s emotion for her old country as well as her determination to succeed here.
1	Because she was promiseing herself that when spring comes back then she will take the drivers test agin.
2	The author concludes with this paragraph to show her determination. When she says. “…when the snows melt and the geese return and his hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” Saeng is explaining how the geese have the determination to fly back and that the hibiscus has the determination to bud again so why shouldn’t she have the determination and confidence to take the test again. Saeng said, “I-I failed the test.” It seems as if failing the driving test made her feel like she was going to fail in the new country. But after she saw the geese’s and hibiscus’s determination through harsh conditions, she was determined to try the test again.
1	The author concludes this story with that paragraph to explain how she already took the test and it is now winter, she will retake the test again when all of the flowers and plants come back to life and start again. Saeng wants to take the test again to show her mother that she can pass it, she bought a plant called. dorl Faeng-noi for nineteen dollars to help her mother not be disapointed. However mother was disapointed that she spent that much money on a plant. 
2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it shows that when she sees the things from her home and living, it will comfort her in what she does. The author seems like she needs things from her homeland that help her make the best of things and bring back good memories of earlier life. I think that whenever I want to do a good job It helps to think of the good  things that mean alot to me so I will be happy and want to do good. The author is smart to want to see those things for her to retake her test because if she sees her plant doing well and sees the memory of the geese again it will be good luck for her.
3	The author chooses to end the story with such a paragraph as this in order to show that Saeng has received a new burst of hope from her memories and the newly familiar things in her new home. The combination of the failed driver’s test and being away from her original home caused Saeng to feel much loss. While Saeng is in the flower shop, “aware of loss so deep and strong that it stung Saeng’s eyes now swept over her. “Through the rest of the story Saeng is shown to still be down, and the reader is left unsure if she will be alright. Then her recovery begins with the presence of familiar things. “The pungent small of bitter melon wafted out, and Saeng’s mouth watered,”, “The winter hibiscus’ was in the ground now”, and, “overhead a flock of Canada geese flew by, their faints honks clear and – yes – Familiar to Saeng now.” This realization that the geese are familiar to her gives way to new realization and a new wave of hope. She recognizes the fact that she is now coming to be familiar with many of the things about her new hone that she had initially thought to be strange. This is what the final paragraph explains to the reader. It summarizes Saeng’s newfound hope that she will learn to not just live in her new home, but to thrive in it. 
2	The auther concludes the story with this statement because it shows that to her the hibiscus symbolizes overcoming obstacles. It symbolizes this because she says”...and the geese return and this is budding, I will take that test again” (Ho @NUM1). This shows that even though she failed it this time when the hibiscus gets bigger she will retake the test, it shows ??? or overcoming obstacles. Also I believe that this symbolizes overcoming obstacles because it “gives her strength from her old country”. This shows that it symbolizes overcoming obstacles because it will help her overcome this test. It will do this by giving her strength or comforting her. From this you can tell that the author ends the story with this statement. ???...
9	To whom it @MONTH1 concern, I think computers are a good thing. It is good because you get to learn about forein places. Keep in touch with family and friends and it is good entertainment. First, computers are great to learn about forein places. On the computers you could research a place and look at pictures before you go. If I wanted to go to a far away place like @LOCATION3. I would go on the computer and find the best part to go to and I would look at different hotels to stay at the reviews it has gotten. Aslo, if someone were to do a paper on a different country or even state that they've never been to they would go on the computer. Sure, you can get the same info from books but you can filter out what you don't need on the computer. In my history calss, I had to do a report on the state of @LOCATION2. I have never been there so I want on the computer. Books could have given me the same info but computers are always up to date and accurate. Seecond, computers help you keep in touch with family and friends. There are numerous websites that allow you to share photos and talk to friends or family. I recently signed up for facebook and I am able to talk to friends instead of using mytexts and running over the phone bill every mont. My dad has a facebook too, he talks to people he hesn't seen since he moved heve from the @LOCATION1 white mountains. Some other sites are aim, aol, and myspace. Lastly computers are good entertainment. Computers allow you to see that concert you didn't go to or that movie that's never on tv. When I went to a skate board demo at skate lair I had tons of fun. The other day though, I started thinking about it. I went on youtube and type in&quot;nike sb skate lair demo&quot; and clicked on it. i watched it and about halfway through it I saw my face! i was so exited. Computer also allow you to check the news and weather. This is good because if you are on the road and you want to see what's going on you can take out a laptop and checked the weather or news. That is why I think computers are necessary. Yes people do stay on four hours at a time but most people only go on for a small amount.
1	I believe that the author concludes  the story with this paragraph because it says that Saeng is confident and is willing to go back and take the test. Saeng feels good about her self and wants to do this.
0	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because Saeng was taking a test. In the story there are some quotes to support my response “I-I failed the test” Saeng said.” This shows that she was taking a test about gardening. Another reason why the author concludes the story with this paragraph is because the story was about spring, gardening, and the life of it to them. The paragraph talks about spring, and flowers. The daughter and mother live off of the plants by planting vetagables, and fruits.
2	The  last  paragraph of the story.” Winter Hibiscus by Minfong  Ho is important to the story. The last paragraph leaves a definite ending so the  reader  knows  exactly what is going to happen  in the future.  This  paragraph is a very significant ending to the story because it represent s symbols in the story. The author concludes the hibiscus is important to her. Along with the hibiscus it also shows that the  geese  and the melting of the snow represent a fresh  start  and a new  beginning . These symbols  are  important  to her in that they  give  her a chance to start over and she sees that in the  winter  hibiscus.
1	Saeng was very distrout knowing that she didn’t passed the test the test and to her she felt as though it was a let down or disappointment. This sentence shows the ambition and determination that Saeng has so that she will be able to pass this test.
3	The author concludes the story with when they come back …”to show how saeng has changed throughout the plot of the story. In the beginning she refers to her new home as, “walking into another world.” As teenager she had to move from Vietnam where traditions are so much different than in the United States. However, there is one plant that is similar, the winter Hibiscus. The plant connects her previous life and home to the life and home she lives now. It was hard to adapt to the situation of moving, but the plant created familiar scents and the “familiar fragrance “which “filled her lungs .” It was even difficult for saeng to say the words “at home” without bursting into tears. Once the winter Hibiscus was in the ground it changed saeng and she realized that she needed to appreciate what she had. In conclusion, the author ended the story with that paragraph because it showed how much the plant resembled saeng and how her mind set on life was altered.  
3	I feel that the author concludes the story with this phrase as a way of showing how Saeng is adopting to her new home, yet still valueing her old one. The gist of the sentence is that Saeng will take her test again in the spring, showing her perseverance. However, the sentence also shows how Saeng is coming to know her new land. She says,”when the snows melt and the geese return” this is important because the geese and the snow are of her now home, and she now accepts them. However, Saeng also says, “when this hibiscus is budding,&quot;  and this shows how Saeng is still thinking of her old home, because the plant is her connection to the memories of Vietnam.  Therefore, I feel that the author is showing how Saeng is growing up and living with changes in her life by ending the story with this statement.   
0	I think that the author is saying  to  day  is that when it is winter the hibiscus is  trying to piece the cold. While must plants just die the hibiscus must face it head on
2	I think the author includes this because she doesn’t want to leave her audience guessing about what would happen next. Then “I will take the test again.” This quote is saying she @MONTH1 have failed the test with the plant but she is never going to give up and that when spring comes she is going to try again. I feel as though the author added this to give a better understanding of how it feels to leave your homeland to come to a place you don’t no or understand such as the flower situation in the story. When she thought about the plants and how they smelt it gave her the old feelings that she had about her homeland and how close she was with her grandmother. She was so use to plants being free and growing rather than seeing them in pots and not having the room to grow. By seeing all this got Saeng to break down and cry. In conclusion I feel as though the author added the paragraph in the end for understanding and to all so let you no that Saeng @MONTH1 be in a new place with a new culture but she will never give up on that test until she feels that she has passed it.
2	The author of “Winter Hibiscus” purposely had that last paragraph in there. Honestly the story is better with it too. In the last paragraph when it says “In the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” @CAPS1 @NUM1. When the author write all those things in nature that will happen it symbolized re-birth and a fresh start, a new chance and that is what Saeng needs with her drivers license. The author put powerfully. Put those symbols in there to show hope for the girl to make it through her tough time. Finally, the story has a sense of roundness and end with that last paragraph, the story is complete.
0	The reason I think the author concludes the story with that paragraph was because it was a good learning story you can learn something from it .The author did that so you can get a better understanding of the of the story. It said “saeng .teenage  girl, and her family have moved to the united states of Vietnam.” So from reading that it tells me that its telling you what happen right before the story took place. So you can get a better understanding. To me its rapping it all up for you. Thats why I think the author concludes the story with the paragraph.
8	Dear Newspaper, I firmly believe that people do spend a lot of time on computers, alot of teens spend alot of time on computers, I also think this from my own experience and I surveyed @PERSON1's @NUM1 grade @CAPS4 class. I would first like to expand my idea of teens spend alot of time on the computer, some teens go on the internet and do homework or might check their emails others go on @CAPS1 for hours and got addicted, so they're not outside or doing sports. In my own experience I used to have a @CAPS1 and I woud be at it for the whole day and I woud miss out on hanging with my family and friends. So I deleted the account. But, I still feel addicted to the computer I'm always listening to music or chating with my friends or checking my emails like most people The things* And lastly else to @PERSON1's @NUM1 grade @CAPS4 class, @PERCENT1 of people a day on it, @PERCENT2 said that they spend @PERCENT3 of people. That they now go on the computer. These that just one @NUM1 grade class most students are addicted to it.* no matter what age. This is why I believe that people do spend to much time or the. Many students go on @CAPS1 for hours at a time and in my own experience I have been addicted to the comp. and @PERSON1's @NUM1 grade @CAPS4 class when I surveyed them there ans a very high percentage of people that said they were addicted to the computer. So parents please tell your children if they need to spend less time on the computer.
2	I believe the author of “winter Hibiscus “ends the story like she did because saeng agrees to take the test again. She wants to take the test when the snow melts, the geese return and the hibiscus is budding. In other words when spring has come she will be ready for the test.  Saeng states in the story “it’s the flowers aren’t as pretty, but it’s strong enough to make it through the cold months here, thes winte hibiscus. That’s what matters.” I think saeng is using this as a guiding light since she just moved from Vietnam. She plans to make it and use the plant as a symbol. She will try again for her drivers license at the start of spring.
2	The author used &quot;when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again” because its resembling that her mother is refreshing, waking, and restoring its self. And Saeng said she would retake the driving test when that happens. She was really sad she failed. “I – I failed the test” She seemed to be embarrassed + sad. So that last paragraph does a good job describing what Saeng is going to do. She is going to look on the bright side of things and restore her self to come back and pass the test
0	I the narrator this paragraph in the story because hibiscus is a valueable plant and garden is you own decision if you like to grow things like her mother grow hot pepper. Garden is a way to @CAPS1 different like the different types of foods you can plant and the different plants in the world there eg @CAPS2, lilis, and other other plants like that.
1	The author ends the story with that paragraph because she is trying to overcome an obstacle. Failing the driver’s test was a set back for Saeng so she plans to take it again. She plans to use the hibiscus as motivation, because the winter for the hibiscus is like overcoming an obstacle.
1	Why I think the author concludes the story with this paragraph is because I think it’s showing how much it actually means to her and shows that she does actually care And by showing that she care's will take the test again.
1	She ends the story with that paragraph because she wants to let everyone know she feels most comfortable in the spring. It also states that she can not wait for the geese and the hibiscus to start budding because it is her favorite time of the year.
2	Saeng is not comftorable in her sorryndings, and has not addapted to the changes from where she moved. She finds the hibiscus and choses to go buy it, because it reminds of her home in @LOCATION2. When she brings it home  her mother seems shocked at first by the price saeng had paid, but is then more sympathetic when she realizes she misses @LOCATION2. Sheang says she is going to retake her test in the spring. She is also implying that she is going to change her attitude about living in @LOCATION1.
0	I think the author concludes that in the story becaue he is saying when the geese is coming back.
2	The author concludes that because she wants to show that Saeng was not giving up. I say this because she moved to, a place where she didn’t like and knew No one. The author is trying to tell us no matter what don’t give up, have faith. At the end Saeng has faith in herself that she can past the test next time. She @MONTH1 have realized that just because your at place you don’t want to, it doesn’t mean you can’t go on.
1	The author concludes the story like that to give the reader the idea that you cant just quit if you fail. When Saeng said that when spring comes around I will return and take the test again, that shows that she will not quit and life will go on. That’s why I think the author chose to conclude the story like that.
11	Dear @CAPS1 Have you ever wondered how much the world wide web has to offer? I would definetly agree that computers have a benificial effect on people. They teach hand eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about far away places and they give people the chance to recconnect or new people. The internet has so much to offer and is absolutley benifical. Studies done by @PERSON1, doctor at @ORGANIZATION1 stated that @PERCENT1 of people who are on the computer typing have better hand eye coordination than those who do not. You could be improving your coordination and not even know it! Intelligent people would agree that being on the computer is very helpful to you. There are many computer games are there that you have to react quickly to and call for fast reflex and hand eye coordination. I know personally that it has help us. Since @CAPS2 been on the computer more I have noticed that my reaction time off this block for has shockly improved! Yes, I know that some people should get outside and exercise, but you can excersize and improve your hand eye coordination, either way you can go wrong. As the massive sits in space like high take fascinating worlds it the computers. The technology of computers to learn about the far away places. Kevin, scientist that @PERCENT2 of our knowing about space come from computers! For example think about google earth; it allows the human eye to see clear pictures of anywhere in the world! I think you would agree that without computers we would a lot of knowledge about the wonderful world around us. Would you rather us not have computers and not know half the stuff about we live in? By these high tech computers we can learn about life outside like space, and other galaxies. Did you know that @NUM1 of the population use the computer to talk, and reconnect to friends and family. I know I do! I know that people shouldn't be to computer, talking to people. But its a great way to stay in touch with people. They have awesome websites like skype and oovo that allows you to chat with other people over. Friendly, educated people agree that this is a good way to catch up with old friends from highschool or even way back to grade school. Another great aspect of online communicating is long friendships can be created. Newly explain, now they not online and got so close they ! Personally I know that I go to @DATE1 camp every year and make new friends. Internet websites like facebook helped me keep in touch with her. Clearly this is a great source to use! The time has come to decide the choice of using computers would deffinetly be a wise one. Without a doubt it will certainly help you; hand eye coordination and keep you talk or recconect with people. Most importantly it gives people the ability to learn about the wonders of far away places. So dont make the wrong choice, and appreciate and use all this computers have to offer.
2	I think That The author concludes the story with This paragraph to show that she does not want to give up on fighting her homesickness. The first time she bought that plant, it brought back memories of her old home and it showed how much she missed it there. By saying shell do the test again shows that she doesnt want to let ths defeat her in her new home and her new life.
2	The author concludes saeng vow in the story to show that saeng can and does have the ability to overcome obstacle. Saeng  feels like she is a failer. Her hibiscus represents courage to overcome her obstacle which is her driving test that she failed. The geese represent survial and to never give up, to keep trying your hardest to success.
2	The author concludes the story with this because the girl in the story is almost like the flower itself. Just as the flower will blossom, Saeng will take the test again, both receive a fresh start on things. Finishing the story this way left the reader feeling positive, it was a short ending but one with a lot of meaning. “ ...and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” I think the last sentence is almost inspirational and it makes you want to start out fresh as well as Saeng.
2	The author ends the story with  “When they come back, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again” For many good reasons. Some reasons are, that she will keep moving on and adapting to her new life in Canada. She is going to change her way of life and try to fit in with her new culture. She is also going to have to relive the memory of her grandmother again and wants to handle it better. “ A wave of loss so deep and strong that it stung Saeng’s eye now swept over her.” She wants to be able to handle the loss better. The author wants to emphasize that the story is not yet over.      
0	There are many reasons the narrator could have ended with this paragraph. One reason it's the start of the winter so hibiscus won't return until spring. Also, it’s the end of the story so it’s a good way to end it because it’s the ending of the hibiscus and the ending of the story. The last paragraph also kind of summarizes up the story and it’s short and sweet. Which makes it a great ending to the story. It’s not like most endings to a story so it’s unique. Because most stories aren’t about nature. In conclusion, there are many reasons the narrator could have choose to end the story with this paragraph.
2	The author concludes the story with his paragraph to show how people can regain their determination. In the beginning of the story, Saeng is disheartened after failing her driving test. When she sees the Hibiscus, she is filled with memories of the past and weeps. Her mother's kindness causes Saeng to draw strength from the flower, which, as her mother says, is &quot;strong enough to make it through the cold months here.&quot; @CAPS1 that the Hibiscus will bud in the spring, Saeng renews her determination to pass the test. 
0	The author ends with this response  because he is trying to say that Saeng will repeat her self but this time more helpful in the garden and her mother.Try harder with her school work and less focusing on gardening.
1	Saeng's peRsonality in this stoRy shows deteRmination and confident. I think she feels that she could do moRe experienced things on different plants. I also think this is a peRfect hobby experience foR someone who loves Plants. I feel that Saeng @MONTH1 have accomplished heR goals of planting. I think she @MONTH1 want to puRsue heR career in gaRdenning. When she stated that when the plants come back aRound, she would take the test again. I think she means that, she is willing to exploRe more plants. I think she @MONTH1 have got this experience of planting fRom heR motheR. To me this @MONTH1 have been a family tradition. Saeng will pRobably have kids and teach them about different types of floweRs.
3	The author ended the story with the paragraph in order to show that Saeng is looking forward into her life and with a positive outlook. It shows that she is not going to be depressed by the change in her life anymore. The hibiscus is used as a device for this story’s plot. When changes happen with the hibiscus, changes happen in the story. At first, Saeng is without the hibiscus and feels hopeless. When she sees it, she remembers her past and is sad. Once she plans it, things start to look up. She begins to accept the change when the last paragraph says, “when they come back... and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again” it shows that Saeng is looking at her future positively, and with this positive change, the hibiscus is now beginning to bloom. The author concludes the story in a symbolic way that helps express the story’s themes.
1	The author concludes the story with this paragraph “Saeng vowed silently to herself” because she Saeng wants to do in proper time and season. “winter season”, the land or soil was so cold that plants was not able to grow properly. ”Hibiscus costs nineteen dollars”, and she Saeng failed the test. ”There was frail, wiry beauty to her Saeng mother that touched Saeng deeply”, she Saeng mother is shining when she worked to plants. These all are the description that concludes in the past which want to make correction and shine like her mother and also to pass the test.  
7	Dear newspaper, @CAPS1 you want to learn good hand-eye coordination? @CAPS1 you want to have the ability to learn about far away places? And @CAPS1 you want to talk online with other people? If you said @CAPS3 to all of these questions then using a computer is the way to go! While using a computer you can @CAPS1 many things. You can look up a good healty recipe for your family or find a good relaxing place to @CAPS1 your daliy yoga. Although some people say that using a computer cuts down your time for exercising and enjoying nature, but it really doesn't. A recent poll was talking at the planet fitness in newington @CAPS2 and it showed that @PERCENT1 of the exercising people discovered planet fitness by the internet. @PERSON1 nature of the department of health and wellness said &quot;@PERCENT2 of my customers take online corses of exercising at home so that they don't have to be in public.&quot; @CAPS3 i know it seems lazy to not go to a gym but, some people are terrified about what others think at them, so its I mean who doesn't want to exerise in the warning conforts of your own home and not have to go to a sweaty old gym? All right-minded people would stay at home and exersie from thier computer and not have to go to a sweaty and smelly gym. So its never. @CAPS1 you go to a sweaty old gym, or @CAPS1 you stay at your beautiful clean have with the inernet? Image, as soon as you get up in the well rested, instead of going to a yuchy gym you can stay home and enjoy a relaxing walk out in the comfort of your own home. Certently you care about your nose and want to be able to smell a nice warn apple one. But if you dont thats fine too. So don't go to a gym, stay at home and enjoy your day with your internet!!! I say stay at name and love your internet!!!
2	At the end of the short start “Winter Hibiscus,” Saeng says “when they comeback, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding then I will take that test again.&quot; When she says this she is refering to her drivers test she says she will take the test again because she is reminded that her family didnt give up they moved to @LOCATION1 for a fresh start “plant she had forgotten drew her back to her childhood world. “She sees these flowers after failing which reminds her that she never given up before. So she wont now other.  
1	The author is trying to convey a sense of hope for Saeng in her new country. After noting that she failed her test, which is probably a citizenship test, the author wants to conclude the story with something that reasures the reader. It is obvious that this test was important because Saeng could not even look her mother in the eye. This was probably why she bought the flower for her mother. The ending reasures the reader so that you don’t wonder how it will workout for Saeng.
0	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because to tell us that she will try and find that flower to bring back memories of her old home. To show us that they will be caming   back again it will survive even though its not from where she wanted it to be from. In the story it says,” I I failed the test,” meaning saeng had bought the hibiscus that wasn it real or what she thought was not what she wanted to be. In the last paragraph she says she will take that test again. Saying she will find winter hibiscus that is how it use to be in the homeland. She’s hoping they survive and hoping she finds a flower like it because in that last paragraph it says ,”saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding ,then I will take that test again,” meaning she hopes and prays she will find one like her old homeland.      
0	The Author was trying to end the story quick thats why he ended it with this one.
1	When spring comes and all the snow melts then she is going to plant newseeds. The author concludes that because she didn’t do good on the test the first time. But next year she is going to work with her plants then take the test again so she can pass it. The author put that in the conclusion because he don’t want people to think that she just worries about the plants.
0	In the story &quot;Winter Hibiscus&quot; is about this girl named Saeng and her mother and grandmother. Flowers are beauitful to them they plant them all day. Picking them, @CAPS1 them. “Saeng did not dare look her mother in the eye”    
1	The author concludes the story with the saying because it shows that she has confent in her self because she did not pass the test she could take it again and know she can pass the test she was up set about it her mother when she talk to her made her feel good and confent to do or retake the test and know she could pass the test so that why I think the author concludes it with that saying at the end of the story.
1	This paragraph means when winter is over and the geese come back from the south, and she favorite plant comes back that used to be in her old country, she will try what she was trying to do before but this time she has more confidence. This is what I think this means.
2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it sums everything up and solves the conflict of her failing her driver's test. When Saeng said &quot;… I will take that test again&quot; it showed that she is determined to pass the tes and will try again. Since the conflict is solved there you pretty much have to introduce a new conflict to keep the story going so the author just ends it. This excerpt from the last paragraph also incorporates Saeng difficultly to that geese because just as geese faces hardships getting her driver lisense. But also like the geese she will go back her face hardships again. 
3	In the story “ Winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho the author ends the story in a well mannered carhoined. The author ended with that paragraph to show that Saeng was not going to persuade even though for away from home. She is in a down was spiral at the beginning of the story she had failed a test and the hibiscus test her feeling nostalgic. When she got home her mother greeted her with kinds words kind of acting as an anti-depressent by making her food will not peppers and bitter melons. This kind of made Saeng see the good in life causing her not to give up and be confident that she will pass the test.
7	Dear the daily newspaper crew, I have seen some of your own disagree about using computers. I for one believe that using a comenter really isn't that bad. For example, the computer is actually good for education. Many use them to create @NUM1 images of things for schoolprojects or science fair projects. I use these machines to play video games on to cure my boredum like most young teens and children do. Unlike most people I dont stay on it forever. I usually play for a couple hours. There are some downsides to having computer in the house. For one the machines use up load of energy in the house making the electric bill rise and @DATE1. On some websites there are people who try to be a stalker like the website my space and twitter but on the bright side these who try to be a stalker usually instantly get caught and put in jail. Computers actually have a positive effect on the mind and movements. For example children who have computers learn how to fly a kite or for themselves with their parents watching and they learn hand-eye. Many children who play sports that have computers actually manage to catch a ball faster than usual. So you see computers are not that bad. So please think of what will happen to children if computers are banned.
2	Well in the story, Saeng  fails her driving test. When she is walking home she sees a familar plant, she then goes to a flourist and finds out the plant is called a hibiscus. She then buys the plant with the little money she has because it reminds her of her homeland and childhood. It also reminds her of her grandmother who she left behind so now she is connected to the plant. Also she sees geese fly over head heading south for the winter, so she says “When they come back,” so she means when the geese fly north for @DATE1. And when “the snow melts&quot; so when it becomes warmer and starts spring. When “this hibiscus is budding,” so when spring comes and the plant starts to bloom she will “take that test again&quot; so she says she will take the driving test that she failed when spring comes. She gives herself the winter to practice and get ready for the test . She vows to herself that come spring she will be ready to take the test and this time she will pass.
1	She said this too show the determination it takes to make it no matter how many times you fail you need to get back up and try again. She displays her courage in this way also, it takes alot for someone to fail something and to get back up and try again on it. She isnt willing to accept failure, and she's trying to redeem her failure so she says she'll try again. That is why she ended the story that way.
1	The author concludes the story with this paragraph. I think the author did this so that people who read the story will know what she is gonna do next spring and they might make out another storie in so that you will know that she will take the test in the spring.
2	In the story winter hibiscus the author concludes the story with that paragraph because when the winter hits and the plant she likes will disappear and the flower gave her good luck so she said “when the snow melt in the spring and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again. The flower was very important to her. She said, “that rich, sweet scent that was familiar too. She was talking about the flowers smell compares to her grand mothers shell, it was the same.
0	The author concludes the story like this because she is going to come back and do the samething next year.
1	The author concludes the story with that because she want's to retake the test. Because she wants to pass the test for her mother. So she brought home the flower to apologize to her mother.
1	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because everything in the story will repeat such as the season changes and you will not be able to plant nor grow in the winter. For example she talked about how the plants are nothing like her home, but she has to adapt to the fact she’s not home, &amp; adjust to her environment. I say this because if she doesnt she will just be an unhappen person worrying about where she came from.
2	The author concludes the response by saying that when spring comes and the hibiscus is budding she will take the test again. because I think she feels hope and faith. I say this because the girl just moved away from her home and feels horribly lonesome and deppresed   because she wants to go home. She I nostalgic for her past and when she sees the plant it gives her a sense of comfort like she is home. When she says “In the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” I think she says this because she is upset because she failed her test and the plant gives her a sense of comfort which gives her faith and hope that she will pass the test in spring.
1	when they come back Saeng vowed silently to herself In the spring when the snows melts and the geese return and this hibicus budding then I will take that test again
3	In “@CAPS1 Hibiscus” by @PERSON1, the author choose the last paragraph because it matched the tone, the hope and the representation of the essay. The tone of the story is more of a depress ful mood because she failed the drivers test so she is very upset. He memories of her old country start to get to her when she sees the winter hibiscus. “And in the warm moist shelter of the greenhouse, Saeng broke down and wept.” She misses Vietnam very much and seeing this plant in this store gives her like flash backs. The winter starts to give her the feels all hope is lost. “almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now.” To her the strange things are starting to feel the same year by year no new hope, no new anything just the same old thing day by day. This plant really starts to tear her apart just purly from the representation. “She found that she was still to shakey to say the word at home, lest she burst into tews again.” She can’t say home because home isn’t hers in the United States but in Vietnam. This winter hibiscus gives Saeng an explosion of emence emotion’s all having to deal with her past sr the last paragraph is more giving to how when her hope returns in spring she will just try again. Tone, hope, and representation all support the last paragraph so thats why it fits when it does
11	I Believe that computers have a positive effect on people. Computers are a relatively new invention, they have become very popular. Computers allo people to talk online with each other. They also allow students to complete homework assignments and important projects. Computers also allow people to store important files and pictures in places that won't get lost. Computers are helpful in so many ways, but these are just a few. Computers allow people online. whether @CAPS3's through email, instant messaging, or a video chat, computers peplace old and haved ways @ORGANIZATION1 communication. For example, instead @ORGANIZATION1 writing a letter to someone, mailinbg @CAPS3 to them, and having to wait two days for them to receive @CAPS3, email them! Obtain an email address, type a message, and click send. They will receive the message instantly, and even reply soon enough @PERSON1, president @ORGANIZATION1 the @ORGANIZATION1, says, &quot;Computers are an important part fo technology. People use them everyday.&quot; @CAPS1 them everyday doesn't mean just for fun. @CAPS3 also helps with work. Three out @ORGANIZATION1 four adults who used computers say that they help them with their work and social status. Computers are a part @ORGANIZATION1 everyday life, and they can help with almost anything. Computers allow students to finish homework and projects quite fst. Instead @ORGANIZATION1 hand-writing that four-page essay on @PERSON2 @CAPS1 textbooks and use the internet for finding information. Computers also allow students to email teachers in case @ORGANIZATION1 missed classes and assignments. @CAPS4 @PERSON3, a student at @ORGANIZATION2 who had missed quite a few days @ORGANIZATION1 school, says, &quot;@CAPS2 I had to do was email my teachers, and they sent me @CAPS2 the homework assignment. I missed @CAPS3 was that easy.&quot; @CAPS4's not the only one who agrees that computers are a big help. Millions @ORGANIZATION1 kids &amp; adults agree. Computers not only let students write reports; they also allows them to save them for future uses. They also save important files and precious pictures. Everyone hates @CAPS3 when their camera or video camera breaks, and will their precious and wonderful memories are gone. Well, just save them to the computer, and they're there forever! @NUM1 out @ORGANIZATION1 @NUM2 people who store @CAPS2 their pictures in a computer agrees this is the best way to do @CAPS3. In conclusion, computers do have a positive effect on people. They allow people to talk online. do homework &amp; projects, and store important files. I can assume that everyone agrees with me that computers are an important part @ORGANIZATION1 everyday life. We just woudn't be the world we are without them.
3	This was a very interesting story and it snowed all the hardships this young girl has gone through, the author ended it in a very interesting way. When they ended the story I thought to myself how nice it ended. If think the author did a very nice job. She made it so that she snowed all the hard ships that Saeng had gone through, as if they were the harsh winter. Then as the author said, “as the snow melts away;…”,I think this shows how even though Saeng  problems seem never ending and harsh, that one day they will be gone and things will become beautiful again, like the flower budding. In the spring time. Also she did a nice job because throughout the story I could feel her pain. I felt as if I was there with her because of her use of descriptive  words like, “exploding, shock ,intense” and others to describe how much of a sudden was everything was. Then when she ended it, it was like she was showing us Saeng’s hope for a better future, even though things aren’t the way they were back home!
2	The author concludes the story with the paragraph -“ when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again.” (@NUM1) because she feels that when the hibiscus blooms she can too bloom by passing the test. Also Saeng is relating herself to the hibiscus. “Its’ flower arn’t as pretty, but it’s strong enough to make it throu in here, this winter hibiscus.” (@NUM1) Her mother is trying to tell her she can be strong also. She too can make it through the cold months. “like the geese she lifted her head and watched as their distinctive V was etered against the evening sky, slowly fading into the distance.” (@NUM1) Just like the geese Saeng is realizing to be proud of herself and there will be other chances. Don’t always doubt yourself becase they will be other chances. Don’t be afraid to try again.
1	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because she means she will go back after winter to take care of it. The author puts this at the ending paragraph because he is telling how much she cares about this plant cause she takes care of it because it reminds her of her hometown. So that is the reason she takes such good care of it so she will have something with her to remind her of her home.
3	The author concludes the story with the paragraph about the geese because it shows how Saeng, like the geese, will adopt to her new environment. It shows that she will do what needs to be done in order to survive just like the geese have to do. She will take the test again and will not give up. The paragraph shows how she wants to adapt to the new country. For example, the narration states, “… she noticed the tearstains on her daughter’s cheeks and her puffy eyes”[No]. This example shows how Saeng is not used to being in the new country and that she does not like it. However, she will get used to it and do her best to do so, as shown in the closing paragraph. Also, the narration states, “…she admitted to herself, she much preferred it to a Big Mac”[Ho]. This proves how even though she @MONTH1 not like things at times, Saeng is willing to try them to get used to the new country. The narration states, “…she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become familiar to her now “[@NUM1].Saeng is getting more and more used to her surrounding and is adopting to them, just like the geese adapt, which is the reason the author ended the story with the paragraph about geese.
1	The reason why the author wrote the conclusion paragraph was to show that Saeng is looking forward to a brighter future. Saeng is hoping to see the geese once more that remind her of her homeland and that see wants to pass the driving. In this story I feel as though Saeng is a very sentimental person and so that is why I think that is reason the author wrote the conclusion paragraph.
1	He author concludes this paragraph in this story because It sounds good and to show the people he is writing it to that no matter what happend s to you in life you should Just keep on doing what you think is best for you. Just like the flower she keeps coming back for more after going through all that’s tuff. 
1	The author concludes the story with that paragraph for a reason. The hibiscus reminds her of Vietnam. The geese remind her of her home now. These two things make her strong. Therefore, she will take the test when they return. She thinks she can pass the test when the flower and the geese are in her life.
0	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it shows that Saeng is starting to take responsibility for her school work now. For example in the story she made it obvious she cared more about the garden then school.
0	Saeng was talking about testing the plants seeing if the geese liked where she planted them. I know this because she mensioned geese in the last paragraph and in the geese said “yes| when she planted the hibiscus.
9	Dear @LOCATION1, I think computers are a great tool for everyone if they use it right. Here are my reasons why. First of all, I think computers are good because news travels quickly. Using the internet, world changing news can spread like wildfire and inform everyone in seconds. It is great for staying in the loop and reading about things you need to know. This reminds me of the time when a massive earth quake hit @LOCATION2 and traumatized its citizens. Within moments of the accidents, it was already circling the internet. This brought mass attention to @LOCATION2 which caused many people to donate and needed items. Secondly, the computer is also good for researching topics for school and common interest. If you need facts for a school project you can easily search what you need through the internet wide variety of search engines, you will be able to pin-point exactly what you are also look up things that interest you. If you have a favorite sports team, band, or are interested in a famous figure, you have tons of information on them at your disposal. You can do all of this within the privacy of your on home so you can remain as secret as a @ORGANIZATION1 agent. This reminds me of the time when are of my idols died. Within seconds of hearing the tragic news I was able to search the topic and get an endless uphoria of information regarding his death. Finally, you can chat with someone from around the world if you wanted to! Using social networking sites like facebook and myspace, you can connect with your friends and chat with them for hours on end. You can also enter chatrooms with people who share a common interest with you. Just like how I talk to people about a band we both love. I believe access to news, research, and staying in touch with your friends is without a doubt the best reasons to use a computer. What are you waiting for? Get one!
1	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because the story was mostly talking about the hibiscus. Saeng was saying that when it’s spring and this hibiscus is budding then she will take the test again. The hibiscus reminded her of her homeland in the past.
1	I think the author concludes the story with that paragraph because at the end is talking of a new begining. Also what it’s going to be at the new begining she says that she is going to take the test again.
2	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because she has a better state of mind because she found  a  flower that reminds her of homeland. She is afraid that her parents  are going to be mad at for not passing the test, therefore she  buys  a  flower  that she sees for it remind. When she gets home and telling her mom how much she paid for the flower  and  how  she  didn’t  pass, mother is upset for only a second, then she is understanding of what her  daughter is going throgh. By the end  of the story she has  more confidence  that  she  will succeed next time.
2	Minfong tto ended the story with aphrase dialogue because it was about the main topic of the story. Saeng was to buy a plant and bring it home, but when she did so, her mother did not approve. The narrative states &quot;You what?&quot; Her mother stared at her incredulously&quot;(Ho ). When her mothesaid this, it showed that she was displeased. The narrative states, &quot;I-I failed the test&quot;(Ho). Saeng was not proud to displease her parents in any way. By saying, &quot;When hey come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return  and this hibiscus is budding, then i will take that test again&quot;(Ho), the author is just showing Saeng's love and want to grow foe her parents; it shows maturity. 
1	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to tell the reader that Saeng is going to take the test again. The author wants to tell the reader because she fail the test she know what she did wrong and shes going to correct. For example when Saeng said, “then I will take that test again.” Saeng feel sorry she fail a simple test so she wants to retake the test when the snow melts.
1	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because the plant wasent budding and the geese are going away and then see failed the test because all that made her sad. But when the snow melts, the geese return and the plant starts budding she will be happy again and she will take the test agian and she will pass because she is happy.
1	The author concludes the story this way for many reasons. One reason is to show Saeng is not going to give up and keep trying to pass her test. Another way is to show that even though your life has changed that don’t mean that you have to give up. These are some of the way that the author concludes the story like he does.
1	I think the author concluded the story with this paragraph because they wanted to show that she is comited to her nature especially to The hibiscus. She thought that the hibiscus was special because of what she did with it. Like when they said “she reached out and touched petal gently. It felt smooth and cool, with a hint of velet toward the centre”. And that’s why I think the author concluded the story with this paragraph.  
1	I think that the author concludes the story with this paragraph is because Saeng feels like that will be the right time to take over her driving test over and when the hibiscus is budding. And another reason would be because the authors wants to show her determination,
2	She vowed this paragraph because she wanted to make her mother proud by passing the test after she had failed it, but she waits for the plant to go through and start budding. The hibiscus buddy is like a new start so it makes it through winter and it will pass the test and then Saeng will be able to pass as well because she knows a tropick plant was able to survive a harsh winter then she can survive / pass the test the next spring.
8	Dear @CAPS1, I am writing this letter to inform you about my opinion on the effects computers have on people. I don't agree I think the experts are correct that people are spending too much time on their computer. My following reasons will explain why I don't agree. I think there is also an issue with computers. Please read on to understand my reasons. First of all, my reason on not agreeing with those who support technology is because their is no saftey! I think chatting online is great but dangerous. For example, most kids are followed by and its usually online. This is because the information all to unknown people. Also, kids get into dangerous for example they get kidnapped for this informal and the people they talk to. Secondly, I don't agree because it also caused addiction to the computers. Most people get addicted for the certain things they do online. These life of can also become dangerous. For example, people play some video games wich people killing and commiting crime. We cant not do in the &quot;real' world. These kind of game also bring people to dangerous. Another example is we've had students bringing because violence is the answer when it ! The addiction to computer is so bad that people do have a look of and interacting with things. Lastly, I dont agree because its also. Most people who are and again. These of into an life because you do enjoying at all. For example, people die of. This letter will effect others so thanks for reading. Hopefully, people understand why I dont agree.
0	Why I think the auther concludes the last paragraph in the story because it's kind of like a moral to the story. Shes trying to say that when the time is right she will try it again untill she gets it right. Without this last paragraph you wouldn't be able to understand the message of the story.
0	Saeng is a very helpful young lady to her mom she makes things the author made that the ending sentence to make the story more intresting for the read ond to keep thom heoked to the end
1	The authoR concludes the stoRy with that sentence b/c she wanted to explain to you that she will do this again when the hibiscus is back in season.
1	I guess she says this because she only wants to take the test when she is confetebel around the flowers, plants, and greens
1	I think that the author concludes the story with this paragraph because it says when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding then I will take the test again which means that when she gets older and gets more confidence then she will blossom and get to take the test when she is ready just like the hibiscus will be ready to start to budding again.
0	The Author ends the story off with that paragraph because when dealing with flowers and nature. Then are seasons  when the flowers don’t  come up like winter for example. The paragraph is saying in the spring when the winter is over she tells her self that she will look forward to seeing all the plant that nature has to give.
0	I believe he used this as the ending to ensure that she was strong and she would do whatever it took to perservere.
1	The author includes  this sentence in  the paragraph  because  it’s  the  start  of  a  new  beginning.
2	In the story the author concludes with “When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself’ in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” I think she did that to say that you shouldn’t give up. In the story Saeng goes to the store and “touched a petal.” She buys the plant in an attempt to get a reminder of her old home. In this way it seems Saeng is willing to give up her memories of her past. When she brings home the plant and her mom and her plant it in the garden. I think Saeng is trying to make her new home like her old.
2	The author, Minfong Ho, concludes the story with Saeng vowing to take the test in the spring when the geese return, the snow melts, and the hibiscus is budding. This is done to symbolize the many things that Saeng learnt. For example, she learnt she has to adjust to changes in her life and becoming familiar to the new things. The geese and snow she admits are the things that were “strange before [and] had become familiar to her now”. The hibiscus also represents something and has a reason for being included in the last paragraph. It represents the ability to overcome obstacles, connection to the past, and comfort when needed. The last paragraph symbolizes many things, and if you look into it deeply, you will learn what Saeng learnt.
8	Dear Local @CAPS1, I think computers benefit society greaty. Most of what we do today could not happen without computers. The biggest use of computers is comunication. If you're in @LOCATION1 on a buisnoss trip but need to send a letter to your company, you can send an emil which is much less expensive than paying for as piece of @CAPS1. The experts concerns that people aren't spending enough time with family and friends is a point. Many people cominucate with family and friends through computers. I would hardely yet to talk to my cousin if I couldn't go on facebook. I would have had to wait another month to find out my other cousin was engaged if I didn't follow her on @CAPS2. If the concern is face to face contact, the computer has a cure for that, too, a video messaging site called ooVoo. Another way computers allow comunication is through the shareing of information. Many facts needed for school are spread out in hundreds of books. Over the @CAPS3, I've done research for a project and have been able to get facts from the @ORGANIZATION1 and @ORGANIZATION2 about crime stats. Many times researching an animal will take you online because more modern books note good website to travel to for more information. Without the @CAPS3, a simple reasearch project could take for months. Some scientists think people are spending too much time on the computer. This both right and wrong. Sitting at a computer watching youtube for hours is not nessasarily the best thing. However, the @CAPS4 is also for computer. The @CAPS4 has designed a game so that you can have fun while getting excersize. Computers are like chocolate. They can be good, but too much is a bad thing.
11	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3, @DATE1's society is much more different from what it was like twenty years ago. We have phones that can easily allow us to browse the web as we please just like a computer. Our access to such a large network beings us together, can broaden mental horisons and keep many @CAPS5 hard workers on key point so that when time for work comes around, they are ready. Not everyone agrees that technology is benefit to our growing well, but I believe it keeps us moving forward and away from ignorance in all of its forms. Our construction workers work hard during their busy seasons. They vigorously build sley scraping towers, educational fucilities, additions to our health center, and even the very places we call home. However, when weather is not on their side and building anything can be hazzardous in the long run, they must still ramain at the ready when duty calls. Lately, there has been an advancement in technology to help chane opperators maintain their skills during their of season vistually. It @MONTH1 appear easy to the untrained spectation. To one it @MONTH1 seem like all they do is seat themselves in a pull a few levers, and push a few buttons. However, there is in fact a persition to such a task. Pull the lever to quickly and the crane can go sharply in the wrong direction causing it to tip over. One of feild reponters tried the @CAPS1 virtual trainer and found a @CAPS1 appreciation for the jobs at our builders. That just goes to show that @CAPS5 one does not keep such skill in check, they could in fact cause a serious malfunction on a construction site. I, personally, find it very entertaining and at the same time educational to learn a language different from my own. In fact, I teach myself @CAPS4 at home. However, @CAPS5 I did not have a computer at home, my studies would be near impossible. With @DATE1's economy going to a class outside &amp; school, or even hiring a personal tutor, can be enough to effect anyones budget emensly. The internet provides an efficient low casting, or even free, way to help any language learner. One can even find study tips from native speakers at those who have already learned vast bit about the language. In @DATE1's society not everyone has the time to go to he library and pick up a book on a country they are interested in. Some @MONTH1 say that asking a neighbor about their home canbe just as afective, but that can awkward for those that don't particulary do well in face to face setting. However, havbing a complete at hand can make learning an enjoyabl experience. Once can find blog posts about someone's visti to there country of interest &amp; even videos of their time there. Websites made entirely for those interesting a particular culture can also prove helpful. On the other hand, @CAPS5 someone were to be looking for and acception vacation spot recommended by locals, that information can be found as well. Some people do not love in an area where they can connect with family by a simple call or a drive. One @MONTH1 have to take a plane or pay to take with relatives. Social networks on the web makes connecting with lvoe ones easier and more affordable. The speed of instant messaging can make it seem like they are in the same room instead across the ocean. I hope that everything I have fare travel can serve a purpose to someone who has not been able to find way benefits to technological advances. Please do remember that technology can serve as a skill maintenance tool, educational, and as a connection for our foreign born citizens. Thank you for
2	The author ends the story with Saeng vowing to herself the relationship between passing and driving test and the significance of the hibiscus flower. The flower is linked to the way things used to be for her in Vietnam. For example, hibiscus in @LOCATION3 was “Madagascar periwinkle” in Vietnam. It also symbolizes how the flower adapts to its surrounding when taken from a different country in accordance to Saeng adjusting to life in @LOCATION3. The reason she said when spring comes she will take the test again symbolizes that connection of the flower to the way she lives now. For instance, her ability and determination that when that flower buds she will overcome obsticles. Another is a connection of her past experiences. And it was a sense of comforting to her after she failed her driving test. The author linked the flower’s significance to the ending of the story showing the hope and dedication to Saeng and the obstacles she passes to get where she is today.
1	The reason why I belive the author concluded the story like that, is because, she is going going to aways start over. For instants in the story she said I–I failed the test. From that known she throught she was going to give up. So that is why I belive he ended the story with that line
2	The author concluded the story with that paragraph because the author is trying to say that Saeng is going to start all over again just like the hibiscus would. Even though you go through bad times in your life just step and do it over again until it becomes better. The author also concluded the story with that paragraph because the paragraph pretty much starts the story all over again that like Saeng was going do.  
0	She means that when she return she is going to do the same thing again and see if she will do better or not.
1	Saeng vowed siletly to herself &quot;in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again&quot; because her mind went of the track from think about a flower. She says &quot; One of the blossoms had fallen off&quot; then carefully Saeng picked it up and smelled it. it happ distracted her mind. Her promisreaction from tailing was silentess for a long moment and didn't say nothing. Her never got mad. All she did was brushing the fragments of green off Saeng's hands. Her mother was mainly thinking about the plants as the day went, Saeng dug out a hole and carefully lowered the 'winter hibiscus&quot; into it. Seeing her mother caused a reaction of ideas, so trying to etch a image of geese. She sent a goat to retake the driving test again as she was getting use to her new. The intro says &quot;Saeng, a teenage girl and her family have moved to the United States from Vietnam. it never mentioned about her family&quot;
2	The author included this paragraph to show how much the girl missed Vietnam. When the girl saw the hibiscus it brought back memories of Vietnam. Seeing the hibiscus allows her to find comfort. So the paragraph is there to show how the United States is different from Vietnam. Since the United States has changing seasons it allows the girl to get use to the United States. The plant will always be there, but she has to look for the good that United States provides. The author states, “Almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now.” This quote shows how the girl was getting use to the United States. How she will always remember Vietnam, and finds things in the United States that remind her of Vietnam. In conclusion, the paragraph is used to show how much the girl missed Vietnam, but how she finds comfort within the United States.
0	Thes basically say that he will be around again just like the geese always come back.
2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph for several reasons. One being that she is still uncomfor table about talking about her old home ‘’She was still to make to say the words at home’’ [HO] so the snow melting the geese returning, and the hibiscus budding. Second remind her of her home. We know this because Saeng   says ‘’ Just as she known it would feel… ’’ Back home it Just grow wild just at from the cracks in the brick walls or between tiled roofs’’ [HO].So with reminder of her home she is give both comfort and confidence. The author therefore concluded with this paragraph because since the geese, hibiscus, and the snow melting remind her of her home, that is when she will take the test again, w hen she is confident and strong.   
2	By adding this paragraph to the end of the story, it show that a resolution was made and that the theme of overcoming obstacles is present in the story. When Saeng failed the test, she was miserable and heartbroken however, after buying the hibiscus, she had found hope and motivation and decides, in the end, that she will take the test again, “in the spring, when the snow melt, and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding”. This hope at the end of the story helps put the reader at ease when they wonder what might happen next. Its to help move the story to a conclusion. This is why most endings are meaningful like this. Readers are able to abtein the message as the story from paragraphs like this. In this case, the author’s message was to never give up and that people find motivation in simple things. It is important to know what a author is trying to tell the reader through paragraphs as not only a reader trying to understand the purpose of a story, but also as a writer trying to express their ideas clearly to an audience.
3	I think that the author uses this quote, “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and the hibiscus is buding, then I will take the test  again.” @CAPS1 it symbolizes that spring brings new life and hope. “But where was the home thought come? The hibiscus hedge? The way her gentle grandmother?” “BOAT RIDE into the night and it was gone.” @CAPS2 from Vietnam to @LOCATION2. one night she had so much hope, like, abundance, then the next she is in foreign land that is nothing like her old home. The flowers bloom in the spring bringing new life. There is a chance to move on @CAPS1 there is hope. There is hope that spring will come, flowers will come birds will come. It is a chance to let go. The ending quote was said to bring hope and like to her and she sort of promises to herself that it will get better. Hope is what makes every obstacle to get over easier and everything to be bearable. 
9	Dear Local newspaper, @CAPS1 are big aguments about if computers are good or bad. I think that computers benifit our society. Why, because it makes socializeing easir, You can gain lots of education and also help with buisnesses. Wow, I cant believe how easy it it to ather people with computers. Computer are helping family chat with family and friends chat with freinds. It help peoples socialize by letting messages on paper that to be forever to deliver and to get one back, also if family members go away on a vacation you can still contact them. Or simply if a friend cant get a ride to another friends house they on still talk on the computer. Also a computer gives you an oportunity to socialize with people all over the world. Its amazing how easy it is to talk with other people with the computer. I really astonishing how much education we have gained from using the computer. Computers have given us to many part to learn. Before computers you learned about things from books, And many of those books could not teach you as well as a computer does. With a computer you can learn about space and stars and planets. Also with computers you can learn about other nation. What @CAPS1 culture and landscapes are like without even being @CAPS1. Computers have truly played a vital role in our education. Computers have done lots of things but not as much stuff as the did for buisnessed. The computer itself was a busness and people model lots of money. It helped buisnessed organize @CAPS1 work and money also its given people lots of jobs working on computers. Also it gave buisnesses, quicker, more eficiant way to put up for people to by @CAPS1. Computers have played a vital role in creating our economy. Computers have made socialize long easer. The ability us to get more education. Also it helps with our buisnesses This is why I think that computers have benifited our society.
2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show that the hibiscus is a symbol for Saeng. In the sping time the hibiscus grows just like Saeng. When Saeng got to the new place she was small and peuney just like the plant. “Its leaves quavering in the wind&quot; (@NUM1). This quote tells us the the plant was weak a peuney. If the plant was strong it would not be quivering. The fact that Saeng brokedown and bought the plant tells us she was not strong. And at the end the author uses that paragraph to tell the reader that the hibiscus is strong and so is Saeng and the can over come anything.
2	The author concludes the story this way to show Saeng does not give up and is determined to pass the test. The narration says “Not like the kind we had @NUM1]. Saeng feels very strongly about her old home and wants hibiscus just like her and her grandmother used to have. Because Saeng would not bring back the same kind of hibiscus, she is sad and determined to get another one. The text also states, “… and the hibiscus is budding then I will take the test @NUM2]. This also shows she is determined because even though she failed the test once she is going it to try again. She misses her home and wants hibiscus just like she had at her old home. 
1	In this story the reason that the author concludes things this way is to pick a tone that feel comfortable to test again. The person who will take the test again my have picked the tone with relation to her past which she takes the time to prepare herself and maybe that is something her parents or grandparents taught her.
1	The author concluded this because she thinks this is the right time to re take the test. She adds this because the snow is melted, the hibiscus is budding, and the geese return is a perfect time because everything is back and warm. She says &quot;when they come back...then I will take the test again.” means she will have all confidence to take the test. Saeng voweds to take it again and she will and she thinks this time she will pass. That's what theauthor concludes this to the story.
2	The Author concludes the story with this paragraph to show the hope and the meaning of the hibiscus to Saeng. The author also ends the story like that because spring is a time for new beginings and where everything comes back to life and starts to regrow so to say that when the snow melts and geese return. &quot;Its. saying its the right time for a secnd chance. I.t failed the test Saeng said.....She tore off a leaf shruddy it to pests”. that shows the dying of the hope she had or the hybisus symbolized it. So that’s why the author ended it like that b/c it shows new heqionqrys.
3	The author concludes the story, “Winter Hibiscus”, with the strong paragraph of one sentence starting that Saeng will take the test when the geese return and the hibiscus is budding. This sentence leaves the reader in suspense while incorporating the main point of the story and combining them to express an idea about what might happen in a continuation on the future of @CAPS1 and this story. After all, the reason Saeng had bought the hibiscus was to comfort her mother and her-self. While she stood watching the geese, the author chose this moment to express Saeng’s feelings to stay determined and take the test. In the end, the author concluded the story with a string sentence which not only summerized the story, but left a cliff hangs.
0	“When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself ,in the spring ,when snows melt and geese return and  this hibiscus is budding ,then I will take the test again” . The author concludes the story with this paragraph because this makes you think about the story after your done reading it.
2	In many stories the narrator uses a dramatic yet conclusive statement to end the story. An example of one such occurrence is in the short story “Winter Hibiscus”. In the story the young girl finishes of by telling us when she will be taking her test again, although not directly to us as it says “Saeng vowed silently to herself” but it still informs the reader. The reason the author includes this last “vowe” is to inform not only the reader of the future but to show the girls determination and spiritual connection with the plant. For example, when it says “and this hibiscus is budding” its showing the girls connection with the plant because of the comfort and canfidence it given her, ecpecially since she needs to take the test. In conclusion the narrator concluded the story with the paragraph to show future events and to illustrate the spiritual connection the girl was with her the flower and the homeland.
1	In the story, at the end of the last paragraph the author wrote that “why they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again” (last paragraph). The author concludes the story with this paragraph because he wants to mention that Saeng is a student and she had failed a test. Even though Saeng is so interest in flowers she also cares about her school too. When the snows melt Saeng will take the test just like the hibiscus is budding and starting to blossome.
1	After they come Saeng  was  silently  to herself , In the spring , when the snows melt  and  the geese return and  the hibiscus  is Saeng  then  I am  take that test again.  She  say this sentence she is herself back to home .She  thinks  it familiar to Saeng  was. She  is herself  how  quiet it vowed  to  so  every season . Her live is very quiet and leavy . She feels  as  of place .  Due to failing her driving test things herself  was thing for her to united state was so different from vietnam and she expresses  her  feelings  will she talk a about this something flower.   
8	Dear @CAPS1 Newspaper I'm writing a letter to you about how I feel about the effects that computers have on people. One of my reasons is that people that spend to much time on the computers they are litting their lifes pass by them. But the people that work on computers all day is a different thing. My second reason is that people could be on the computers and still interact with their family because they live with each other. My last reason is why do people want to be on computers all day. I'm not talking about the people that work on computer. My last reason is that the people that is spending all their time on the computer they are letting their lifes pass by there. The reason I say this is because if you are on the computer @NUM1 your life is passing by you. Because you are not doing nothing, just sitting in a chair in the computer getting fat. Also if you are going to be on the computer at least they to find a job on the computer. But I'm not talking about the people that work in computer all day long, because they have to do it. Its their job to. Thats one of my reasons. My second reason is that the people this me in the computer they still interact with their family. The reasons I say this is because you could be on the computer and will interact with my family because you live it the same huge as them, two when you are not in the computer you could be with your family and spend time with them. That's why i said that you still could interact with your family even you see on the computer. The last and final reason is do people to spend most of their lifes on the computer. The person I like this because type of person would spend most of their life on the computer and don't go find a job go enjoy their life. Also if you got kids you have fun with your children and make them believe that they parents that was to them, that, they had fun with them, and that they had somebody that they could look up too. So don't spend your life time on the computer geting fat, not spending time with their children and make something yourselfs. But I'm not talking about the people that workon computers. I'm talking about the people that don't work on computers. Thats why I said don't let youre life pass by you. i hope you liked the prompt and that you wont spend a lot of your life in the computer doing nothing just getting fat and letting your life pass you. I'll report myself again I'm not talking about the people that have to work in the computer. I'm talking about the people that don't work in computers.
1	The author conclude the story with this paragraph because the author wants to remind the reader and summarize the story. The way she wants to summarize is how the story started with Saeng failing the test to how the story endend with saeng planting the hibiscus in the winter. The author wants to remind the reader about the whole story.
1	He concludes this story like that so you dont feel as if she was defeated. She is now more aware or believes she can complete the task. Also she has more selfconcious in herself because of the flower and now it reminds her of her home.
2	The auther concluded the story with this because just like the flower it will come back a new, and so will she. The flower represents determination, using the flower to show her own determination. Even though she failed her drivers test she still has determination to take it, and try to pass again. Even with failur she is determained to get over it. Just like the flower losing its buds in the winter and growing them back. Saeng is frogeting her failure and coming back a new.
3	The author uses this paragraph as a symbol of realization, and new beginnig for Saeng. She spent so much time missing the past, that she didn’t know how to enjoy the present, which theme-wise the author is saying “live in the moment”. The hibiscus represents strength, as her mother said,&quot;It's strong enough to make it through the winter months,... that’s what matters. the author is say ultimately that tough times are irevitable, so hold on to the moments that make you smile, for they will help you perservere through the times that are tough.
3	In the story “winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho the character Saeng had many obstacles to overcome. In the end of the story Saeng vows to herself when winter is over she will take the test again. I think that the author ends the story like that to foreshadow the future for Saeng It seems like the author is trying to say Saeng will be taking time to adjust to her new lifestyle and focus on other things before she takes the test again. It also shows that Saeng has a lot of courage to complete what she has once failed. The perserverance in Saeng shows and will help her overcome many things in her new country. In the text when Saeng's mother starts to dig a hole she says “let me help mother.” This shows her love towards her mother and her care for the plant that represents her pastime. So in the end of the story adding the vow was a good way to show Saeng’s commitment.
1	The author puts that excerpt into the text to show the reader that she had made a mistake an will fix it in the future. I believe the other put it in  for that reason because in the text Saeng began to cry when she admitted to her mother that she failed the test. This shows that she was really upset by the fact she failed an hopes to improve in the near future. Another reason why I believe ‘the author concludes the story like this is to lead the reader on to believe Saeng is going to get over beign home sick.
2	The author ends the story “Winter Hibiscus” with the passage “When they come back Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” She is saying how she is going to try to take the test again because of the fact that she failed the first time. I think the hibiscus she bought comforted her and made her think of her home land so she thought when the hibiscus is budding she will take the test again. The plant made her think positivly. And insted of thinking she will fail she is thinking she will pass the next time. I also think Saeng felt comforting her when she was upset and I think that helped her feel alot better.
3	The author concludes this story, “Winter Hibiscus,” with that paragraph as a sign of reasurrance. Saeng had had a tough few years adapting to the United States from Vietnam, this paragraph leaves the reader with hope that she will overcome this challenge just like a bump in the road. Saeng had just had a rough day after just failing her driver’s test and wanted to buy the plant she saw on her walk home. While in the greenhouse she says, “That, at least, she could hold on to. But where was the fine-toothed comb? The hibiscus hedge? The well? Her gentle grandmother?” Saeng missed all these things from Vietnam, especially during this rough time. The final paragraph gives hope that she will take the test again and it will all be okay. The winter is a symbol of the hardships she has and will continue to go through. It says,”…in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.’ The winter is a hardship for the geese in that they must move away, the hibiscus must survive the cold winter, and the winter is time Saeng will be away from Vietnam. As the geese and the hibiscus overcome it, so will she. This last paragraph is a good, positive and hopeful ending to this touching story, so the reader knows to have hope in life.   
0	There is why the author ended the story with this paragraph. It mean that when she comes back after winter she will repeat her tasks all over. For example she will dig, sen flowers, their customers. Then when winter comes again she will do it all over. So has steally the other is using different words to say when winter ends she will repeat her actions. That is why the author ended the story with that paragraph.
1	The author brought out the paragraph &quot;when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again&quot;, to portray the theme of the story. Saeng used the hibiscus for hope in her life. The author also uses the choice of words or diction to explain the way Saeng lived her life depending on a flower. The paragraph also explains the way her culture is depending on the theme of the story.
6	I am writing this article to inform you on how most people are spending their time an computers. In this article I am going to tell you about computers and what people are doing with them these days. Some people use their computers for business of work related. But then again these are people that use them for entertainment and other social things. These are the people that just sit on the computer all day. What they could be doing is enjoying life. Going outside and getting fresh air. But no they want to sit inside all day long on the computer. Now is why do people want to stay inside all day long on the computer some people are constantly on their social websites. Such as @CAPS1 or @CAPS2. They are obsessed so thoes are teo websites that are very addicting to some people. and then these are the people who just like looking things up. Then lastly just get off, go spend time with your family the computer will always be there. And use the computer only when you need to. Yeah its fun to go look up things for your entertainment. But all things are good in moderation. So I hope you will listen and also agree with me I think I made my point about how much you should use computers. So thank you for listening.
2	The author conconcludes the story with this paragraph because, the plant brings back memories to Saeng and she is sort of like the plant. Saeng can be compared to the plant by, she is starting out in a new area that she is unfamiliar with, as well as the plant. The plant is now being planted in the soil outside of her house and has to grow. Saeng has to learn to grow aswell and get better and prepare to take the test again. So when the plant is grown and adapted Saeng believes she will be grown and adapted too. In conclusion, this paragraph is a perfect ending for the story “Winter Hibiscus by Minfong Ho.
2	I think that the author ends this story with that paragraph to some up what the story was all about and to also say that Saeng would try the test again. In the story it says “she realised that many of the thing that she had thought of as strange before had become, though the quiet repetition of season opon reason, almost familiar to her now and this last paragraph help bring all this together.
1	A vow is a good ending, she vowed to take the test again because she failed it. It expresses how she feels and she made a commitment to pass. The author wanted to show a lot of feeling and how desprite she was. So she saw tons of beauty to keep her going.
2	The author concludes the story with the paragraph, &quot;When they come back,&quot; Saeng vowed silently to herself,” in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again. She buys the flower because she failed the drivers test. She has seen the familiar plant on her way home as she went to a florist shop to try to buy one. The flower makes her happy and reminds her of home. The author ends the story the way he does because it leaves hope, so that the story doesn't end sad. She still has hope of passing the drivers test.
2	She failed the test at the same day that she got the plant and saw the geese fly over. The plant and the geese represent symbols to her. The plant represents her home, where she used to live and the geese could represent how they are moving on in life, over coming the obstacles of cold weather, and snow to move on to something better most likely a warmer climate. All of this is a symbol of a new beginning for her. So she wanted to take it again, around the time of a new beginning; when the geese fly over again and the plant grows. She feels thot since she failed, she should start over.
1	The author added the story in with this paragraph for a lot reasons and to make the story longer, and two to show that even if you screw up the first time you can still try again.
0	In the story “Winter Hibiscus,” the author includes this paragraph, when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again, to emphasize that Saeng is willing try plant again in spring. Saeng wants to try planting again in the spring time to prove that she is trying to adapt to the new settings and to prove that she cares about the planting.
1	Saeng  ment  that she will take that test  next  spring and pass it with the hope of her winter flower  and  the  sight of her flock of geese  she  has high hopes that she will pass her test . when  she sees buds  on her hibiscus then she will take the test again. Saeng was very upset when she failed it the @CAPS1 time and she was hoping  she  passed  next  spring.
2	In the short story &quot;Winter Hibiscus&quot; by Minfong Ho, the author concludes with a paragraph explaining when the character, Saeng will take her driving test again. She says she will &quot;when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding.&quot; I think the author concludes with this paragraph because it shows that saeng has new. found hope. For example, since she has moved from Vietnam, she has been very homesick. &quot;She found that she was still too shaky to say the words 'at home,' lest she burst into tears again.&quot; But when she finds a hibiscus plant, it reminds her of her homeland. &quot;Back home it just grew wild, jutting out from the cracks in brick walls or between tiled roofs.&quot; Saeng even buys the hibiscus to plant in her garden in her new home. By having the hibiscus plant with her, it gave her memories of her old life and strength to continue with her new one. The plant gives her strength to try for her driving test again. By concluding with that paragraph, it shows Saeng's change in emotions from depressed to hopeful and it also shows the strength that the hibiscus plant gives her.
2	The author concludes the last paragraph of the story because she already knew that she should not be afraid of trying a new life or new environment. For example, in the story, the mother says, “It’s flowers aren’t pretty, but its strong enough to make it through the cold months ???, this winter hibiscus. “It shows that the mother wants saeng to learn that saeng should be strong even I times of difficult. Another example is, when the narrator says, “she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before become, throught the quiet repition of season upon season…” It shows that saeng realized that the new place that she’s leaving right now is almost the same as their old home – In conclusion, the last paragraph tells that saeng should face the new reality of the world. She should be  strong and follow the flow of life.
2	What compters stop you from doing is your homework in school. But when you do something on the computer your not soposes to do, you get stuck on a website you can't get off your screen. So what I'm trying to say is to don't stay on the computer than just @NUM1 min.
2	“In the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and the hibisus is budding, then I will take that test again” Saeng thinks to herself. Saeng finds herself in a new place were she has no friends. She finds comfort in a plant shop one day when she comes apon a Hibiscus flower. The flower calms her spierit and helps her beguin to adjust to the changes in her life at this time.
3	The author concluded with the paragraph about when winter turns to spring, she will take her driving test again for one main reason. The girl says this because just like the plant coming back to life and starting over, she will start over too. In the essay Saeng, the young girl says, “When they come back in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again.” @CAPS1 Saeng failed the test the first time, She is going to wait until spring so that she can have a fresh start. In the essay, the “winter hibiscus” reminds Saeng of her grandmother and her home in @LOCATION1. This at first makes her sad but then realizes how wonderful her memories are and helps her to get through this tough time. Her memories are going to give her strength to carry on with her life and try her driver’s test again in the spring. 
1	The author ends it with that paragraph because the girl is talking about when the @DATE1 or spring comes again she will try again. The author ends it with that because it explains how the girl feels about spring and the animals. The girl says allot about the geese in the story, so we know from that she likes animals.
3	Then author concludes the story with that paragraph because it sums up how the memories and the plant effects her. Just like the plant Saeng grows better in her own country and likes it better there but she can still survive in a new place if it is taken care of and fights to stay beautiful. The ending shows that Saeng realizes that if she trys harder she can survive like the plant, so she is going to take the test agian. Her mother say, “I‘ve seen this kind blooming along the lake. Its flowers aren’t as pretty, but it’s strong enough to make it through the cold months here.” Her mother is trying to tell the daughter its ok and she get through the hard times. In the end Saeng knows she can.
3	In the winter Hibiscus, the author chose the to end the story with a hopeful paragraph which stated, “when they come back, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this Hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” The reason for the decision to end on an optimistic note are as follows. For example, the Hibiscus represents. The ideas of resilience when faced with challenge , and the determination To adapt and succeed. Saeng’s situation is similar to the flower’s, which has been uprooted from its original spot, replanted, and forced to try and survive the Winter. Saeng has moved from her beloved homeland, she must begin life anew in another country, and has been faied with the obstacle of failure in reyards to an unnamed test. In the final paragraph, she finds that like the cherished hibiscus flower, she must be resilient and determined to succeed in her new home   
1	The author concludes the story with this paragraph (when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again) because it explains what she is going to do when winter is over. Also to keep the readers guessing on what’s going to happen, to Saeng and her mother. Another reason is to have a new story when winter is over.
1	I know the reason why the author concludes the story the way he dose and  it is a good reason . It says that since she failed this year next year when it is time to ready up the garden she will tell again . That is a good moral because you have to keep trying and trying to succeed   because even if you fail you are not losing any  progress. It is like what @PERSON1 had happen to him even though it took him @DATE1 tries to successfully  make the light bulb he simply said “ I just found out @NUM1 ways not to make a light bulb . So I do agree with this author and how he ended the story.  
0	She does this to show her strugle with her gardeding struggle. It is like this because ech year she has to work on her garden because the winter blowes it away meaning it kills it.
2	The author ending the story with that paragraph because it shows how Saeng wont give up. Saeng wants to make her mother proud so she is gonna try to do whatever it takes. All Saeng trys to do is make her mother happy. When she failed her mother was disappointed. Then suprisingly understanding. When Saeng told her mother she failed Saeng started to cry, but then her mother wiped the tears away.
1	ThE author concludEs the story with this paragraph bEcausE mEans that whEn thE shovEl grow again in the spring, whEn thE snow mElts and the gEEsE rEturn and this hibiscus is budding shE will takE thE tEst again. So shE will wait until thE nExt spring to takE thE tEst..
8	Computers are a common household item these days. Due to how much computers are able to do, most people spend a lot more time on the computer than they should, and it is affecting our society. Computers can be very helpful, when trying to find information on a topic, but some people take it too far. Some people, their jobs are on computers. Others like teenager will do gaming or have instant messengers, which sometimes takes away from outside activities. Another situation with computers is that adults can get really into online gambling which is terrible for a person to do even at a casino, but now they can do it from their living room couch. Computers can also keep you in from outside, to get fresh air and sunlight. Computers are bad in someways but good in others. Sometimes computers are a pefect resource. When your history teacher assigns you a @NUM1 page essay on the civil war and you have no idea what happend in the civil war. In this case computers are good. Or your boss could tell you to find the amount of teen deaths in car accidents due to cellphones. Computers seem like a perfect resource. So far you've learned computers have their highs and lows but if computer time was limited then people would be able to do more stuff outside, or read a book. Some people might abuse computers others might not but if computer time was just limited I belive, that a lot of things would be different in our society today.
3	In the story the test was if she could overcome her homesickness. When she want to the greenhouse all of the. plants and flower brought back memories of her homeland. When she saw the flower it reminded her of the times life she would get water from the well and and a flower was floating in it. So after the winter she would go back to the place and see if she was still homesick. I feel she ended it that way because it shows that she will persevere and not give up and try again  
1	I think the author adds the last paragraph because the story could use a little part about Saeng. And what she is planning to do next. Also the author @MONTH1 have added that paragraph because she was maybe thinking about writing a second story of winter Hibiscus, and they wanted to write a part that could be about in the next story. It would make you wonder that if she does take the test again would she pass it this time after the snow melts, the geese return and the hibiscus is budding. I think this @MONTH1 be why the author added this paragraph in the story.
1	I think the author concluded the Story with these lines because Saeng feels more confident. First, when saeng first saw the hibiscus, she was sad, but after seeing the flower, she got happy. Next, her mother helps her plant it and saeng is sure it'll be there in spring. Finally, Saeng feels better since she has reflected on her past
2	I think Minfong Ho concluded her story “Winter Hibiscus” the way she did to show the avid determination of Saeng, the main character. She failed the test but she got the hibiscus and it helped her to restore her resolve to pass the test. Now that she had a moments of her homeland and her family there she was most likely reminded that they would’ve wanted her to succeed, and so she promises herself that she will take that test again when the hibiscus plant starts budding. This is why I feel that “Winter Hibiscus” was concluded in this way.
2	At the end of the essay “Winter Hibiscus” by @CAPS1 Ho, it ends in a positive manner. “When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” The reason why I think that the author decided to put that there, was to show how Saeng felt about her country. So when the country that she is has spring again, she will take that test because that country reminds her of her original country in the spring. Which makes her feel like she is at home and she can at least take the test. Thats why the author put that sentence at the end of the essay.
1	Saeng promises herself that  “In the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test agan.” The hibiscus is meta phorica to Saeng for her childhood. Evidently she grew up in Vietnam and moved to the @LOCATION2. She misses her homeland, and all the flowers remind her of her homeland. She is overwhelmed by all the memories that she breaks down and cries. Change is a difficult thing to overcome or adjust to, especially moving to a foreign country. She has to cope with it though, and by planting the winter hibiscus is a way of coping. She knows that she will eventually adjust to the major change for she realized, “that many of the things she had thought of as strange before had become… almost familiar to her now.” She promises herself that she will retake the drivers test when the hibiscus blossoms because like Saeng a flower changes also. When the hibiscus  finally overcome the cold , dreary winter months and blooms, Saeng will know she is ready to take the test again for that flower can also symbolize her going through changes. The geese in the story also symbolize changes, they have to migrate south in the winter to avoid the cold but return home when its warm enough. Like Saeng, she will avoid the test in the winter but in the spring when she feels comfortable.
1	So she saying she will take the test next year.
1	The author concludes the story of the end because I think the author concludes the end of the story because he wants to kind of say I will be ready next year to sprout again he will be ready to test him to not cry and break down when he sees the plant to think of childhood memories he will be ready o
1	Saeng buys a winter hibiscus to plant in the garden and to remind her of her homeland. She has failed some sort of test and is upset over it. Her mother feels bad for her so she doesn’t get upset that the hibiscus cost @MONEY1. After planting the hibiscus Saeng says to herself, ….In the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, I will take that test again. The author uses this paragraph to make you think about whether or not Saeng will fail or pass the test again. It also makes you wonder about what kind of test since the author says “hibiscus is budding”, and “the geese return”, It must be a test that you can only take once a year. because she says that “In the spring&quot; she will take the test again.
2	The author concluded this paragraph in this story because I think that he is tring to tell the reader a message. The author is tring to say that if a plant can mak it through the cold winter then she can pass her driver’s test. That is why I think the author included that paragraph. 
8	Dear editor, I see that there is an argument between computers being good or bad. I think that my oppinon can help your decision. I think that computers are good. I think they are good because they help kids with social skills, they help people with bad handwriting and they help people learn about things around the world. First of all computers help kids all around the world with social skills. They help them because these is so many ways to communicate with people through the computer. There is instant messaging and webcaming websites. Also a servey said that @PERCENT1 of parents say that the computer raised there kids social skills a lot. Another thing the computer helps with is people with bad handwriting. It helps because you can go on microsoft word and instead of writeing a great report that no one can read you can type I that when I have a paper for school that neatness counts on I always up my report. This can help alot of people who cant write as well as others because on the computer you change the font and everything to make it look as nice as you want. The last reason I think the computer is a good idea is because alot of people dont like to read newspapers and watch the news so they like to research certian subjects they like, to know whats going on around who world. I know my mom doesn't have time to watch the newest the newspaper but when she checks her email the first thing that pops up is the bigest news of the day. People all around the work go so the computer to find of the latest news. I hope you consider my oppinon when you make you decison, where you go think of all the kinds of people it helps. People with social problems, people with bad handwriting, and just busy people who cant sit down and watch the hour news. Thank you for your time.
2	The author concludes the story “Winter Hibiscus” with “When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” The author ends with this promise or commitment because it shows hope and determination. Saeng vowing to herself “I will take that test again,” shows her determination and unwillingness to fail. That is enough to bring hope to someone who has failed and wants another chance. This paragraph also sums up and displays Saeng’s good character. It shows Saeng’s strength because even though she failed the first time she was going to put herself through the pain of trying again to succeed. To fail and try again shows great inner strength. The author also ends with this paragraph because “when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding.” brings everything back full circle. It holds the promise of Spring and better things to come with it. There are many reasons why the author concludes the story with ”when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.”
2	The author added it in at the end not only to make the story have a happy, hopeful ending, but to show the reader that Saeng slowly adjusted to the changes in life. The paragraph above explains that Saeng realized that &quot;the many things that seemed strange before had become,... almost farmiliar to her now.&quot; So the author lastly concludes that eventhough she failed the test this time, just as the geese will return in the spring, then she can take the test again. She just the point of the story across and its a &quot;cheerful&quot; way to end it.
2	The author of &quot;Winter Hibiscus&quot; concludes the story with, &quot;When they came back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test agian.&quot;, to show that the hibiscus plant has given Saeng hope. It has helped he get threw some rough and difficult times. In the story Saeng has just failed her @CAPS1 test and had to walk home. She was very upset. On her way home Saeng saw a familiar flower. She had walked into a flower store to see if they sold the hibiscus that she had seen. The employee pointed her towards the flower. The hibiscus brought back many memories at her hometown in vietnam. Saeng planted her flowers in the vegtable garden. That flower had given her hope. She is ready to try the @CAPS1 test again.
0	The author ends the story with this paragraph because the season is over. For example it is starting in the winter the hibiscuses are dying. Also she is leaving and wont come back till she can plant flowers again in the spring, and she will come back again when she takes the test over again. In conclusion that is why the author ends the story with this paragraph.
2	The reason the author of “Winter hibiscus” ends the story with the last paragraph is to give hope to the end. It gives a certain lift of joy at the end  of a moderatly depressing story. It just goes to show that if you care enough you can keep moving foreward.  And that the end of your world comes when you make it so. That is why I think the author used such a powerful statement at the end.
1	The character has what seems to be a new found confidence and a new joy of the plant that reminds her of her home land comforting her and motovating her. She says when those things come back she will try hard to complete the test. She is setting a time to push herself.  As most people try to do
2	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because it shows how sometimes you have to wait till the time right for you to try again... For example, In the book it says “Madagascar periwinkle, its tag announced, “How strang to see it in apat,” Back home it just grew wild jutting out from the cracks in brick walls or between roofs.” This shows that anything can be done when the time is right.
2	Emotions,symbolizim, to it realized – all are reasons the author concluded the story that way. a reason the author ended the story that way is to leave you, with mixed emotions. Emotions like sadness, hope, and wounder. The author makes the reader feel sad with the girl failing her test and missing home. The author also gives the feeling of hope that they one day will return home. and wandering because the conclusion leaves a lot to be answered. the author uses symbolizes in the concluding, sentances by giving the plant and the geese a sense of impotance in the story and the plant has to do with the home that she really misses. In the final story the author leaves a lot of peceptions on several. Like the importance of the plant and why did they move from a place that they lavd so much. That is why I think the author ended the story that way.
1	In the story winter Hibiscus Saeng is fond of Beautiful flowers that once grew in her home land. Her favirte flower was the winter Hibiscus that had beautiful red pedals on it as of velvet. She also failed a test that she had taken so what the story is trying to say is that nothing can be as good as whats at home but sometimes you just need another chance at something.
0	I think he did because he wanted to show how he loved everything in life.
7	Dear Local newspaper, @CAPS1 opinion is yes people are on the computer to much. I have @NUM1 good reason why I think people are on the computer a lot. @CAPS1 first reason is people are losing time. Second not that much engry. Third you just spending your life on the computer keep on reading why I don't agree that it befits society to people. People losing time to have fun. They do have any time for friends family, pets, and scuh more. It mostly adicaution to go on website like facebook, myspace, @CAPS2, and such more people just need to get off the computer and have fun outside. Mostly people dont really get that much engry. Some people are always inside they just need engry. Fresh our will help that maybe going to the gym or jog outside for a while. Being inside isnt really good for you. Just being inside just make you kinda gang weight. And then you wouldn't have anytime with your friends, and more only if your inside like always. Fineally you spend all your time at home being computer. And you don't have anytime, engry and such more. YOu spend all your time inside computer cool technology but you don't need to be on it @NUM2. You just have time for friends and family. Now you know @CAPS1 opinion why computers are benfit society. People are losing time and everything. People dont have anymore engry. And your spend all your time on the computer. Bye for now.
1	The reason why the author of the story ended the story like that is because after all the hard time that plant went through, it will still bad at the end of the winter. The author said that the plant will take that test again that test is surviving through the could winter and blunming at the end of the winter
2	The author concludes  the story  with  that paragraph  for many reasons. One reason is that the author is trying to say that she is going to overcome  the obstacle  (the test)  no matter what. In the text is say “it can make through  the  cold months. ” @CAPS1 consumer her which supports the last paragraph also, she is in a new country and is starting a new beginning. In the text it says “Not like the same kind we had before.”This implies that it different in this country and she will soon adjust. Finally it says, “this hibiscus is budding” which means she will bloom.
1	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because Saeng is by herself, and letting herself know that she is going to try the test she failed again because she is starting to get used to her new home now that shes found something that reminds her of her life before she left.
1	The author ends the story likes this so readers can understant the theme. Which is, you can always start over, after a mistake is made. For example saeng failed herb driving test and then it took a toll on her she will try again in the spring. I guess she figures that once she once she has renewed  herself she'll do better.
0	Explains why the author concludes the story with this paragraph. Cause it all make a little cent to concludes the story with this. Here why I think it does. The paragraph in the one of the main pieces to to the story. “In the spring, when the snows melt and after return,” all she say is is when the snow is gone and the grass come back, I will start planting again and she would be happy with it, “this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that again,” she went to put her plants up again and tests them to see how them over so she can do them even again. Saeng loved this plant so much that she can’t wait. But when it does she is going to plant a lot. That what the paragraph is saying Saeng is going to wait so he can plant a hibiscus. However, since she came to United States she loved the flower that very much.
1	Because to her it is the best time to do things cause all the happy memories return along with the geese and hibiscus.
1	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because the hibiscus is motivating her to test for her drivers test. In the spring, when the snows melt, the geese return, and the hibiscus is budding, then she will take that test again. 
2	Several reasons, first, in spring she will have had more time to adjust to her new life. Also when the hibiscus starts budding she will feel conforted, as though it auomaticaly brings back her childhood memories. It also is a link to her past home in Vietnam. When the hibiscus adjusts to its new life in ground soil, she will adjust and be ready to take the test again. Its as if, when the plant is ready to start budding, she will also be ready.     
1	The author concludes the story with that sentence a vowed to the flower. It’s just stating that Saeng will come back and try again next year &amp; see if it works out with the hibiscus.
1	The author put the paragraph in to show the he/she care about the flowers. Flowers only come out during spring and @DATE2 time and thats when you plant study all that grows in a garden. So she can pass the test and be happy with the garden.
8	Dear Readers, @CAPS1 you imagine not talking to distant friends, only knowing about your town, or even failing @CAPS5 you didn’t ha a @CAPS3? I know I couldn’t. Some of the great benefits of having a @CAPS3 are talking online with friends, learning about new places and things everywhere, and being able study for and tests from the internet. First, being able to talk to distant friends and relatives is now passive with the @CAPS3. Facts show show that @PERCENT1 of families in the @LOCATION1 have distant friends with @CAPS2, now all of these people can tlk to each other! Ill never forget the time that my close freinds moved, but i was still able to talk to him @CAPS5 of the @CAPS3. Second, the @CAPS3 allows you to learn about new places and things all around the world. I never would have I know about some of the places I've been to if it was for comoputer, @ORGANIZATION1 stated that the @CAPS3 expert @PERSON1 says &quot;@CAPS3 are the reason we have in much without @CAPS3 wouldn't know about the places.&quot; @CAPS4, it is now possible study without @CAPS5 of the @CAPS3, @CAPS6 can be done on the internet online. I'll never forget the that I forget my book, but I @CAPS1 still study @CAPS5 of the online book. In conclusion the @CAPS3 has benifits to you, like interacting with friends online, learning about new places, and being able to study. Computers are just end all-around benifits.
2	The author of “Winter Hibiscus” ends the story with the paragraph “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again&quot; for a couple of reasons. Most of all because the hibiscus blooming represents hope - the plant will survive through the winter months and will grow again and become strong. So, too, will Saeng. Although Saeng is in a strange place where she doesn’t want to be, she is able to overcome adversity and hardship. In the same way, the hibiscus can withstand the winter. This is why the author ends the story the way she does, to give the impression that Saeng still has hope.
2	In the story, “Winter Hibiscus,&quot; Saeng makes a vow to herself. “In the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,” this vow means that she will start fresh, make changes, and adapt to her new life. She want disappoint her mother and she wont be broken down by her memories. She concluded the story like this to show in the future how her life will change and how she would learn to like where she is now.
1	The author concludes the story by the paragph that says, “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, the I will take that test again&quot;, because the author wants to convey that. Saeng isn’t going to quit. She is determined to take and pass the test. It also meas that saeng will wait for the right moment to take the test. She will wait till things get better. The situation that she is in improves because it say’s, &quot;The snow melt, the geese return, and hibiscus is budding.”
3	The author concludes the story with this last paragraph because it shows by spring she will be ready to retake her test. It shows that like the geese who care and come back, she will have time to study and pass her test. In the story the author includes this last paragraph to truly show her dedication to eventually grow to be comfortable in her new home and to pass her drivers test all in good time. Saeng wants to be comfortable with her new life but isn’t yet because of what one misses. But she knows that after this she can go back and try again just like the geese do often our winter. This was a very effective way to end the story because it really communicated Saeng’s message of dedication and longing to overcome her obstacles, her new home and driving.  
2	I think the author concludes like this because its almost like a new beginning. The ending of the story makes you think that Saeng is going to get on with her life. It makes me think that @CAPS1 plans to start her life over in comparison with the hibiscus. Once the plant “starts over” (rebuds) she will start over once again. It also shows that she is determined to continue on with her life in @LOCATION1. She will not let her life be distraught by her move Vietnam. She hopes that she will be able to start her life over again. The ending is a “cliff hanger” to show that her story has not yet completely ended. It shows that there is still possibility that she can get on with her life. It also shows she doesn’t let her failures control her. She is a strong young woman and is determined to overcome this. 
1	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because its a very good ending paragraph that grabs your attention a little bit. Also it shows that the girl is determined to pass her test, so that makes you think this is a determind story. This is why the author concluded the story with this paragraph.
1	The author concludes the story this way to show that saeng intends to try again. an example of her trying again is when she sees the plant and relizes what it symbolizes to her. Another example is her saying that she wants to plant the hibiscas herself so that she holds the memories forever. This is why the author concludes the story in this manner.
2	The author coNcludes the story with this paragraph because she was tryiNg to say siNce the hibiscus is plaNted we are goiNg to see how it does with the winter. ANd wheN spriNg arrives and it's still staNdiNg she caN go take the test. I thiNk the author was compariNg the hibiscus to their life aNd obstacles they will go through, so if the hibiscus is still staNdiNg theN that meaNs everythiNg will be fiNe to where she caN go back aNd take the test.
2	The last paragraph of “Winter Hibiscus” describes determination and the growth of a person. Saeng says that when “this hibiscus is budding,  then I will take that test again.” Just as the hibiscus blooms Saeng will bloom forth and strive through the winter to try and succeed in passing her test. Saeng concludes by saying this as a realization that she can’t be sad forever. She must be determined in order to pass the test. The next season will be a sort of renewal, starting fresh and coming out beautiful as does a hibiscus in bloom.
2	The Author of “Winter Hibiscus”, Minfong Ho, concluded hes story with the paragraph about how when the geese are there, and the hibiscus is blooming, Saeng will take her drivers test again, because she wanted to end on a happy note. In the begining of the story, Saeng, who had just moved from Vietnam to the @LOCATION2, failed her drivers test. She had found a plant they had back in Vietnam, but it made her sad. “I mean it’s not like the kind we had at – at-&quot; she found that she was still too shaky to say the words at home, lest she burst into tears again.” (Ho, @NUM1) So by ending by describing positive things for the future, Saeng could think about that, and get her mind off of everything else.
10	To whom it @MONTH1 concern, Computers can be a great asset to our society, but they are an even, bigger hindrance. People are wasting their days away on the computer. Hardly anyone goes out in exercise, or to enjoy nature. Perhaps the sea west effect is that hardly anyone interacts with their friends and family anymore. @CAPS2 you with their friends and family anymore. @CAPS2 you don't want to surromb to the computers. put down the mouse and go outside! Obesity in @LOCATION1 is at an all time high. Experts agree, that computers and other types of technology are to blame. People who spend a lot of time on the computer hardly ever exercise and that effects them negatively. These people have a shorter lifespan! They might not be around in twenty years to see their grand children grown up. Also, they have many medical problems. @PERSON1, an obesity expert, says, &quot;I have seen a positive correlation with the obesity rate and that of @CAPS1.&quot; @CAPS1 can kill you! Obesity can also cause heart attacks and infertility! @CAPS2 you can avoid these diseases and health risks by getting off the computer, why wouldn't you? Using the computer is not a good price to pay for you health! Do you have fond childhood memories that involve nature? I know I do. Most people who spend too much time on the computer don't get the chance to make memories like that. Theyre too preoccupied with the computer to care. Many people won't ever see any of our national parks! Drew @PERSON2, a park ranger, says. &quot;In the past few years. we have had less visitors than ever before.&quot; @CAPS2 people can't tear themselves away from the computer for even a minute to see the splendor of our national, there is obviously something wrong. Get off you computers and go outside! I share everything with my friends and family and try to spend as much time with them as possible. Almost all people who use the computer often say @PERCENT1 of the time, they use it as an excuse not to see friends and family. In reality, they don't want to leave it. As a society, we are becoming too dependent on technology supervisor says. &quot;I have seen as definite decline in family enrollment. We hardly ever see kids with friends and family hanging around&quot;. She is right. Now is the time to stop using computers! Computers @MONTH1 not be totally to blame for the problems stated above. Maybe it's the people a though computers do contribute to the problem. @CAPS2 we didn't have computers, there would be more people out exercising, and enjoying nature. Memories would be when we hung around with friends and family. Now is the time to turn of the computer, and go outside. Call up a friend and take a stroll, @CAPS3 you do, know you can have fun withour computers.
1	The author concludes the story with these paragraph for a very good reason. In away she just letting it go and will wait to take it again. I think that is a good that she found the flower. That is because it let her and her mother and in away make her better. For example when it say's&quot; the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.
3	The author concludes the story this way to show how the main character, Saeng has changed from the beginning of the story to the end. It show a small amount of newfound confidence Saeng now has. This ending also shows how much of an effect the “Winter hibiscus” had on her. with bringing back memories of her old country. If Saeng wouldn’t have found the hibiscus, she would have never started to reminisce about her old home. This reminiscing not only reminded her of her past, but it also helped her compare her new home to her old home. Through this she realized that life in @LOCATION1 is not so bad, and that she still has a little bit of her old home with her everyday. This realization gave her just enough hope and confidence to want to try the driving test again This ending shows the change of heart Saeng feels for @LOCATION1 and her small gain of hope and confidence.  
2	 The author decides to conclude the story with that because she wants the moral of the story to be burnt in your head. She believes that you will always have a chance to try again and the flower restarts its cycle and it gets another chance to bud and that symbolizes that you can start over and try again just like the girl is going to do on the test. She is doing the test again when the starts over so she can do. it with the flower and the flower budding will support her and give her hope.
1	I believe that the author ends the story the way she did because it talk’s about both of the subjects. The author is trying to say that when she takes her driving test next spring the hibiscus will give her confidence to pass her driving test. The author
2	In the story “Winter Hibiscus” the author ends the story in a way that shows that she wants to start fresh. I think this because when she is talking to her mom at the end of the story, she says “In the spring, when this hibiscus is budding, I will take the test again”. She is saying that she wants to start over. and adapt to her new country. Also, I think this because she wants to wait until the seasons change to go take her test again. because she says “when the snow melts and the geese return.” She states this because she wants a completely new slate when she takes her test again. That is why I believe she wanted to conclude her story this way.
2	I think the author concludes the story like that because its showing the time that will be passing. When it shows time passing, she’s grew up more and maybe she’ll be ready to take the test since now she knows how it is. Also because the hibiscus will be budding, that will make her feel more comfortable and relaxed because it all make her feel more like secure home feeling. “hibiscus is budding” this way the flower will be starting new and so will she.
2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show that she needs to adapt to the new country. She wants to wait when the hibiscus is budding. The plant budding shows than it is adapting to a new environment just like Saeng. The story shows that Saeng is not used to the new country. she cries when she sees the plants because it reminds her of her old home. The plant also comforts her. when she addapts to the new country, then she will take the test again.
1	The author concludes this story with “when they come back Saeng vowed silently to herself in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again because Saeng didnt past her test and knew her mom would be mad so that why she got the flower. If she wouldn’t have failed her test she probably wouldn’t have got the flower in the first place.
2	The author of the story Winter Hibiscus ends the story with Saeng saying a vowe to herself because it shows how important the flower is to her. For example, the hibiscus flower gives her determination because it reminds her of home. Saeng says “… and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again.” The hibiscus flower gives her confidence. It reminds her of her home in Vietnam before they moved to @LOCATION2. Therefore, the author concludes the story with that certain paragraph because it symbolizes the importance of the flower.
2	She feels very connected  to this hibiscus plant because it renind her of her homeland.I think she is trying to say when the hibiscus plant shows it’s inner budding she will to. The plant has to try hard to produce flowers, and the seen has to care out to melt the snow, so that means when it comes around to it  she needs to comes out and melt all of her had habits and get what she meads to do to pass the test. But still not forgetting where she came from and all the memory left bedide. “…vowed silently to herself …then I will take that test again.’’       
11	Dear @ORGANIZATION1, In this new digital age, computors are beaming more and more advanced. You can do just about anything with computors now from talking to people, to learning about faraway places. It is not all as wonderful as it seems, though for people's lives have been ruined because of the internet. It is for that reason that computors are not a benefit to our society. With computors we can learn anyting, go shopping, and contact friends. For many, this deletes the purpose of going outside. You can live your entire life indoors. This lack of exercise can lead to obesity. Also, living this secluded lifestyle can cut off ties with your friends and family. In order to use computors wisely, we have to learn how to balance computor time with an active lifestyle. The problem is, not many people do that. Furthermore, going online too much has been known to produce a second life. With websites like @CAPS1, @CAPS2, and @CAPS3 you can have a whole different online life, with friends that you haven't even seen before. Sometimes, people have even been known to think that their online life is better and get sucked into it. Take @CAPS4 of @CAPS5 for example. It is very popular, but also extremly addicitve. Some play until their entire lives are devoted to playing. Same with @CAPS6 of @CAPS7. This obsession with online games or @CAPS8 is not what internet was made for. Also, peoples lives and reputations have been ruined by computors. Cyber bullying is spreading like wildfire. Its anonymous, and can be detrimental to the lives of others. Internet videos of people acting like idiots never go away. There is one video of a college guy playing with a golf hall retriever like asword called @CAPS9 kid. The video has been viewed over @NUM1 million times. The guy in the video was made fun of for years, sued the people who put the tape online, and was forced into depression. Moving on, people can literally get their lives taken away with computors too. Identity and credit card theft is becoming more and more common. Even my dad had is credit card account stolen last year. Computors must help, but they can hurt much more. In conclusion, computors are a detriment to society. the can hurt people, cause addiction, and seclude your life. Surely this isn't the grounds for something to help society. Truly this is a good thing to let people use.
10	Dear local newspaper, People spend to much time on the computer. Instead of exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with real people they sit down and play games and watch music or movies on the computer. There fore I do not agree with people who say computers benifit the society. @LOCATION1, @LOCATION1, @LOCATION1. A lot of peoples skin is jiggily and fat because of computers. @CAPS5 you @MONTH1 ask? People sit in front of there computers all day when they could spend that time exercising, my dad got extremly over weight when we got a new computer. All he did was sit and play games like @CAPS1 wars or @CAPS2. I couldn't beleive @CAPS5 fat he got so my mom told him and now instead of playing on the computer he goes to the gym. You wouldn't beleive @CAPS5 much weight he lost. Also did you know that america is one of the fatist countrys because people don't exercize and just play on ther laptops and computers. So it would help america alot to stop playing softwear and start exersizing. So many people miss out on the butiful works of nature. The cool relaxing air at the beach is much nicer than a dark stuffy room with just the glow of a computer. There's so much to discover so much to be explored. So yes you could find the gisers in yellow stone online but it's nothing like seeing in real life. If there were computers back in the early @DATE1's people would never had the earge to find new land, you don't hear of many great explorers now do you? I bet if every one took a break from computer new spicies would be found or maybe even a cure for canser. Who knows what you can do if you step out of the box and into the buitful part of nature. &quot;@CAPS3 come down and talk to your grand parents.&quot; &quot;@CAPS4 mom I'm playing on the computer!&quot; @CAPS5 many times has this happend to you? Has your son or daughter been on the computer with great @PERSON1 has been over? They @MONTH1 have wanted to play the computer then but they don't know if thats could have been there last day with him or her. Computer will be here forever or almost forever, peoples time is limited. There fore hanging out with a relitive is much more imortant than playing on the computer. I know a kid named @PERSON2 who was playing on the computer when his friend called and invited him over. @PERSON2 said @CAPS4. His friend was so disiponded and angry. I would be too. Whould you like to have a friend pick computer over you? I'd hope not. There fore computers hurt and are not as good as real people. In conclusion qualiy time with people, nature, and exercize is more important than a glowing box. I hope you agree the computers do not always help society.
0	In the story “winter @CAPS1” the author concludes the story with the last paragraph like that because when the season comes back around for budding she is going to be right back out there exsploring. She’s going to want to learn more about the hibiscus and what they do. And she can’t wait to start taking care of them as they start to bud. Thats why they ended the story with that paragraph.
2	There are many reasons this paragraph is included. It shows the flower will emotionally encourage her when it is budding, because it will remind her of home. This is shown when she says “a blossom of two would have blown into the well” It reminds her of her homeland. It also is to show she is adapting to her new home. when the geese flew by she said”she realized that many things that she thought of as strange before had become, almost familiar to her now.” This shows how she is adapting and is now enjoying her new life. This final paragraph is important because it shows how her life is changing.
1	The author is saying that she will be ready soon enuff when the flowers begin to grow and the geese begin to come home, she will be ready
1	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because she failed the driver's test. She is saying when it get's a little warmer outside and the plants grow in maybe she will then take the test again and hopefully pass. I know that she failed the test because it said&quot; As Saeng walks home after Failing  her driver's test&quot;. I guess that from the snow  being on the ground cause her to  make mistakes when taking the test. In conclusion, that’s why the author concludes the story with this paragraph..
1	In “@CAPS1 Hibiscus,” the author concludes the story with “in the spring, when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,” to make a point. She needs all of those thing to happen for her to be sound enough to take the test again.
2	The author ended the story this way because the plant represents new beginnings in which Saeng needs. Seang failed her test &amp; needed some comfort. She went to the greenhouse &amp; spent @MONEY1 on a hibiscus plant that reminded her of her home. It the same time the hibiscus plant reminded her that her new home is another new beginning. The hibiscus plant gives Saeng better hopes that starting over can be a good thing &amp; that the next time she takes the test, she'll pass.
1	The author concludes the story with this paragraph @CAPS1 reason why he does is because he wants to conclude by writing about geese. Second he like plants and the season’s that they bud. He vowed that he would take that test in the spring. He cant wait until the snow melts so that way he can take the test.
0	The author concludes the story with this paragraph is because she wants that same envioronment and everything she wanted before when she took the test
1	The author’s choice of words in the conclusion of the story, I believe sent of let the reade knew that the story continues. But, I think that the test is that to remind her of home.
1	The Author @CAPS1 the story with “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself. in the spring, when the snow melt and the gees return and this Hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again. She @CAPS1 it with this because she begins the story with Saeng Failing Her Driver license test. and also she was think that the Winter Hibiscus was good luck after it goes away and how she &amp; fimerlary with @CAPS3 which would be the geese she put @CAPS3 together and thats why she said when the geese comes back and the snow melts......That is why she said it.  
8	Dear newspapper I don't think that computers benefit our society. I don’t believe that computers can be dangerous they make people lazy and you can be easily scammed on the computer. One reason why I don’t think that computers benefit society is because it is very dangerous. Computers are dangerous because people can get kidnapped or herrassed. The town of @LOCATION1 police @CAPS1 says that over @PERCENT1 of kidnappings are from people that were met on social networks such as myspace and facebook. The police cheif also says that their are many cusses about people being herrassed by stalkers or people trying to harm them. Another reason why I dont think computers benifit us is because you can be scammed very easily on the computer. @PERCENT2 of people say that they have lost large ammounts of money due to credit card scam's on the computer. On computers their are sites that will act as if they are selling you something and take your credit card number and all of the other information that you give them and they will take your card and buy thing with it and you will have to pay for it credit card companies say that most credit card scams and frauds happen over the computer. The final reason why I don't believe that computers benifit us is because they make people lazy. Computers make people lazy because they are packed with a bunch of fun things like video games and you can watch videos and you could shop and you could see just about anything on a computer. I did some research and found that @PERCENT3 of people that are over weight have account's on multiple sites on computers. These are the reasons why I dont think computers benifit us. I hope you too heed to my advice.
1	I think Saeng concluded with this story because there is always time to make up for the past if the past allows you to meaning that @CAPS1 didn’t past the test. I fell she met that “in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,” to me this means that even though it is snowing outside there is always next spring to start growing back up the vegetable garden this also relates to Saeng even though she failed the test there is always another change we can make up for that lost and retry and try to succeed at this one.
3	The author concludes the story “Winter Hibiscus” with this sentence when they come back saeng vowed silently to her self in spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” The Winter Hibiscus symbolizes her fondness of the place she used to live before. Its not a real one I’m mean not the kind we had at-at” she was still too shaky to say the words at home” when the hibiscus buds” she will still be fond of her home but she will have adapted better to her current enviroment. The geese will have returned to their home means that she will find a place to call home in this place one day. When she finds that place she will find herself ready to “take the test&quot; or do things normally. The author concluded the story with the that sentence to show that Saeng will eventually grow into her new life.
2	The author concluded the story like that because she was being positive. Like the geese are coming back she is positive that she can take the test again. She knows that she will pass the test. In the story she said “Many things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet reptition of season upon season, almost familiar to hernow” This means that when she had just moved here she thought that everything was strange because, she have not seen anything like this before. Now as she is living here to would get use to it because, she knows what will happen nothing will become strange to her anymore since this is her home now
2	The reader thinks the author concludes the story with this paragraph because the girl is saying she will try again, and take that test. In the story “Winter Hibiscus,” Saeng, the girl tock a test and failed it. And she got this flower that brong back memories from the past and decied She tock take this test now that thing are going to get better again. Also when the girl saw those geese flying over her, she knew they will be coming back, coming back after winter in the spring, and when they do her flower will blossom, the one that brings back good memories from the past and she will retake that test and past. Those are some examples of why I think the author concluded the story with that paragraph.
1	The author concludes the story with that story because she loves her homeland and love’s nather and loves her mother. She loves the greeness and cant wait in tell spring comes. so she will take the test of being out of place to herself, that is why she concluds the story that way. 
1	The author of the story “Winter Hibiscus” concludes her story this way to demonstrate the girls determination and to leave the reader anticipating more. I say this because obviously Saeng is determined to do well, but leaving the story hanging builds excitement for more action.
2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it shows that Saeng is getting used to living in a new place. Towards the end of the text, Saeng says that many things she thought were strange before had become familiar to her. The winter hibiscus was comforting, and reminded Saeng of her home. she says “In the spring when the snows melt” because she is beginning to get used to “the quiet repetition of season upon season”. The geese, which form a distinctive V are becoming familiar to her. The last paragraph is an effective way to end the story because it shows that saeng is becoming accostumed to her new surroundings and is hopeful the future.     
1	When they came back, saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again. The author’s main porpuse of this lines wa to grab the readers attention by making a continuing paragraph that a closing she’s adapting to circumstances. Saeng values the uniqueness of plants, she is also conforted by memories of her homeland
2	The author concludes the story with the paragraph “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,” to conclude that she will wait a little bit of time, until plants can be be planty so if she fails again, she will have something to hold on to. For example, when Saeng “failed the @NUM1) she try to overcome the feeling of failing, by buying something that reminds her of her country and bring back the memories to past thro this time. Another example is when Saeng “felt a shock of recognition so intense, it was almost visceral (@NUM2),she forgot about everything that was happening in her life, from moving to @LOCATION1 to failing her test this feeling concentratted her on feeling like home again. In conclusion, the author conclusion, creates the belief that that the was Saeng gets over her problems is by remembering memories like the plant, that reminded her of her home country.
2	I believe that the author concludes the story this way to snow that Saeng  will be of next year . She  said now all the new  @CAPS1 things seemed  weird to her when she first got here , but now  they are second nature to her now  . I think that  the  hibiscus is an can of  hope and inspiration to her . I  think  that she finally realizes  that  she  is in  @LOCATION1 to stay  and  she  can  go  back to  vietnam . So she has to accept  that  she  is  here home  and I think she  is  on her  way  to  doing  that .
8	In my opinion, I do believe that computers are good for you. I agree so because one, it can help you to communicate with other family members around the world. Two, it can teach you new languages you really desired to learn, and three, it can keep you updated on whats happening around the world. First, i believe that computers are good for you because it can let you communicate with your long-lost relatives you hardly see anymore. For example, if you miss any of your family members, you can simply go to your computer and search them up so you can type to them or talk to them through via chat mode, then you won't ever have that missing feeling anymore since you have a computer. In addition, computers can teach you how to learn new languages you alway's wanted to know, like, @CAPS1, or @CAPS2, or even @CAPS3 if you wanted! You can just simply go to your computer and type in &quot;language of @CAPS2&quot;, and listen what it tells you of @CAPS2! Moreover, computers can keep you updated on whats happening around the world! It is way better to see it on computers than on tv's bevause computers give you more information about the situation of the event! Likewise, you could click, &quot;locate area&quot;, on the computer and see in which area the incident took place in. You could also see the video's, behold the images, and seek the location of it on the computer. Sadly, my lecture has come to an . Those were my three main reasons why computers are good for people: You can communicate with long-lost relatives of yours, you can learn new languages, and therefore be updated on the qhats happening around the world. Would'nt you wan't to uphold those amazing events also?
3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because she has faith for a new start. Saeng compares herself to the hibiscus. When the, “hibiscus is @NUM1), she will retake the test. This shows that when the hibiscus restarts its life, so will she. Saeng feels that when the hibiscus is “strong enough to make it through the cold @NUM2), then she is strong enough to pass her driver’s test and live in a new country. Winter and cold represent death, and spring represent a new life or beginning. Saeng thinks to herself, “in the spring… I will take the test @NUM3). This is a new beginning for Saeng, a new hope.
3	In the story “Winter Hibiscus”by Minfong Ho,the author  decided  to  end  it  with  the  sentence   “when they come back, Saeng  vowed  silently  to herself,  in   the  spring. When  the snows  melt and the geese  return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again, because  it show that even though the main character Saeng, @MONTH1 a failed once, she will trying again too. The  geese  will  be coming back to try out a  new  spring  and  the  hibiscus  will be budding new flowers so its like its starting over again as well and Saeng  says  that  if  both  have  made it once they tried again then   she can as well but this time she will succeed. Also, it shows the  determination  all  living  things  have  to  succeed at their main purpose. .The  flower  drivers  to re-bud. The  geese  drive  at  coming back  again  during  the  spring and the main character  drives  at  passing  the  test.The author of ”Winter Hibiscus,”Minfong Ho,put that quote as the last  line of  the  story  for  inspiration.To  inspire  people  to  continue  the  path of life and if  you fail are task,try again.So the author gives you inspiration to help you continue to live your life
3	In the last paragraph of the story, Saeng vows to herself that she will take the driving test again in the spring. The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show the hope that nature brings to her. She describes peaceful things in nature, like the geese and hibiscus, that she draws strength from because they remind her to her homeland. In this way, she’ll always have a little piece of her past with her. Throughout the story, Saeng relates to nature and pulls strength from it. Her mother has a garden, and she relates to it in that she has a different past, preferring natural foods like bitter melons over @LOCATION1. This final paragraph shows the hope that the beautiful nature from her homeland has brought to Saeng, helping her adapt to living in a new place.   
1	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show that she’ll hopefully be stronger. By that I mean she’ll feel comfortable in her new environment and she want miss her home as much. Also she tired the year but failed the best because she didn’t get her grandmother what she asked for and she spent it on something else. That is why I think the author added this paragraph to this story.  
2	The author concludes the story with the paragraph because it shows the main character, Saeng, adapting and trying her best with her new life style. For example, when she vowed to herself in the last paragraph saying, “in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again. This implies that she is putting more effort in to what she do in her new environment and settings. In conclusion, the author concludes the story with that paragraph to show how someone is adapting to change.
0	The author includes this  because he’s using metaphors to explain how the author felt about Saeng’s personal life is
1	The author concludes the story with paragraph because it shows Saeng’s sympathy. She wants to help her mom with the garden because she dissappointed her. For instance, she feels bad about upsetting her mom, and while her mom’s gardening, she says, “Here, let me help, mother,” because her mom’s frail beauty touched her. When Saeng told her mom she failed the driving test, she even knew not to look at her because she was upset, it says, “Saeng didn’t dare look her mother in the eye,” which shows Saeng’s concern for her mother’s reaction. However, in the end, her mother was happy she got it, saying, “It’s a beautiful plant, I’m glad you got it,” which shows the mother and daughter have a close relationship. This is why Saeng’s sympathy to better   herself is shown in the story’s conclusion.
1	The story “Winter Hibiscus” is about a young girl who cares for gardening over schoolwork. The given conclusion is explaining, when spring comes, and the winter hibiscus is gone, she will pass the school test she failed before. Saeng only cares for the winter Hibiscus right now, for example, the line “I paid over nineteen dollars for it.” Explains she used all her money on this plant rather than any other food. Also the quote “I failed the test” with Saeng crying shows she failed it only because she was worrying about the hibiscus. In conclusion over the spring, when the winter hibiscus is gone, Saeng will focus on school more rather than gardening. Maybe now she will pass her test and go back to her hobby of gardening.
2	The author has a good reason in which she concludes the story with this. The main character of the story, Saeng, moves to the united states from Vietnam and fails her drivers test. Saeng has not adapted to the life in the united states and when she sees a firmilar hibiscus plant she buys if for her memory’s of Vietnam. The author is trying to show that since saeng planted the hibiscus during winter, when it blooms in spring she will be ready to try to pass her drivers test because she will have adapted the life in the united states. The theme of the story would be if you are moving away from somewhere you grew up in, bring things that remind you of that place so you still have a little of that culture with you. Therefore the author begins and ends with the same subject.
3	The author concludes the story “Winter Hibiscus” with a sentence about retaking the drivers test in the spring, to express the themes of adopting to circumstances and determination to succeed. The main character in the story, Saeng, is a @CAPS1 immigrant. Because @CAPS2 is not her homeland, there are still many aspects of life here she is not accustomed to, and the story shows her struggle to adapt. For instance when she sees the flower “Madagascar penwinhle” she thinks “how strange to see it in a pot” because “Back home it just grows wild,” The last sentence of the story is symbolic when it says “and the geese return,” because the geese adapt to circumstances by flying south for the winter, just like Saeng is trying to do, and Saeng realizes their pattern are becoming familiar. The very last line says “I will take that test again.” This summarizes the determination Saeng has throughout the entire story. Not only is she determined to succeed in her driver’s test, but in other things as well. For example, when trying to plant the hibiscus Saeng observes that “the soil was cold and hard, and she had trouble thrusting her shovel into it. Despite the difficulty, though, she “Dug out a hole” and knows it’s strong enough to move it through the cold months just like Saeng will be strong enough to overcome obstacles if she tries. The last sentence in the story is significant. It expresses important themes and lends valuable insight into Saeng’s character.  
8	The computer is a good way to contact family and friend. People send messages all over the world or just to fon. People like playing video games or be on websites that they like. People all over the world by laptops to travel to one place to another. Everybody don't be on computer because they think its not go to have but some people do like to have one to be sending messages to hang out with one another or be talking about how was your day. Many people want computer because they do have enough money to @CAPS2 one. Some computers cost a lot @MONEY1 money like, @MONEY3, or @MONEY2 and even more than @MONEY3, or @MONEY2 it depend witch one they get. Around the world many people sell their computers to get money to @CAPS2 different stuff like, shoes, clothes or games. They always sell stuff on ebay to get less or more money, instead they can't take the computer back to get your money or to get a new computer. People want the classic computers, but now they come out with new ones like, touch screen ones. Many people been buying them at @CAPS1 @CAPS2 or @ORGANIZATION1. Every seens the new computers came out people been buying a lot the company been making a lot @MONEY1 money from making the touch screen computers. Every new year the company make new computers so they can get thousands or @MONEY1. Company all over world make different computers to bring out new styles so people can like them and @CAPS2 them. New styles they make more money they make. Some people make their own companies to get money like the other companys get theirs, but some @MONEY1 the money you make some goes to the government. The money the give to the government is to take care @MONEY1 the homeless people. Computers are used from leaning or for fun. People share computers with other people they can't not share it because it wouldn't be fair. Some people take turne using it. Some people don't like taking turn with one another. Everybody share or have they own and they use it or not they can't force their server to it if somebody wants to net on it. Some people lie and say they were geting on it. People like joking around with others. Parents always say a computer is not a tag to play with computers cost a lot to repair and get it fixed all the people spill water on them a the computer mess up and the people be mad and maybe he/she just got a new computer. When computer first came out people bought them to see what they will be like. Many people liked them and it got all over the world and people were talking about them and the company made more and more until it got in stores all over the world. The computer got famase and the company made newer styles for everyone else. People bought a lot @MONEY1 computers everytime they come out with a new style. Many people had @NUM1, or @NUM2 at home as they @CAPS2 them. Companys made other company mad because the other companys were making better styles. People were ordering online to get new computers. And company how make them is making a lot @MONEY1 money. Company stopped making them until they came up with a new computer that is the @CAPS1 one ever. When they came up with one the company was mad that they mad a better one. Some company joined to make one together.
3	The author concluded the story with the paragraph to set the sonip theme. In the story, the @CAPS1 represents very important thing to saeng – confidence, beauty, adaptation… some things she can apply to herself, &amp; her memories of her old homeland. She had failed the driving test. Afterwards, she bought the @CAPS1 to comfort her homesickness. I saw the @CAPS1 as a sort of metaphor to Saeng the same @CAPS1, but growing differently in a different area just as she is still the same but in a new home. The significance of the last paragraph is mainly about the @CAPS1 budding. It represents to Saeng her homeland by the @CAPS1 blossoming ,it can represent her love for the homeland. When the author wrote “then I will take that test again” it is referring to the new confidence she @MONTH1 have later when the @CAPS1 blooms (another @CAPS1 /person metaphor)
2	The author @PERSON1, concludes the story ’’Winter Hibiscus with that paragraph to show Saeng starting over’’… In the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding…@CAPS1 to her life, is that she is starting fresh in a way. Although she @MONTH1 miss her old life, her grandmother, the well, and the fine toothed comb, She is making on effort and ’’take that test again…’’ By relating the test she shows that she is not ready to give in to the ’’ @CAPS2 of loss.’’ and to her grief.     
2	The author ends the story with “when they back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” because she is concluding that the hibiscus comforts her and once once the plant is well and alive, she will be comfortable to take the test. In reality, seeking comfort from a plant seems nieve but its not that she has comfort in the plant itself but that the hibiscus reminds her of her home in which she misses dearly. Once the plant is thriving, as such as her tropical home, she believes that it will comfort her enough to pass the test. In conclusion, this is why the author concludes the story with this paragraph.
3	I believe that the author concludes the story with this paragraph to show how as the plant will grow, so will Saeng . After failing the drivers test, saeng goes to the greenhouse and finds the Hibiscus plant which reminds her of her true home back in Vietnam when they had similar plants. The plant then makes her think about all the memories and she is comforted by them even though she is said. She uses this plant as a tool for comfort  to  help  her think about when she is from and all the good memories to help raise her spirits higher. So to boost her confidence  she decides to plant it. “The “winter hibiscus” was in the ground now, and Saeng tamped down the soil around. “Then she sees geese flying in the sky which  is kind of a symbol do that day, something to rembember  it by, so the next year.” When the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding.” She will take the test again. These things bring back good memories which help to make her stronger.
0	I think Saeng need to take the test over because to get her grade up. Saeng be waring about the snow, in the spirng because she is think about the flower getting cover over it. Saeng mother late her help with the pepper and melons, and lat her state dinner.
1	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because she wants us to know that she’s not giving up on her test. The author wants to inform the readers that she’s not giving up “…then I will take that teat again” which clearly states she still has hope. Author wants to continue on her test to find the right flower. This is why the author concluded the story with that paragraph.
2	The author concludes this story with that paragraph because during winter everything dies down till springs where everything is lively again, the Saeng would feel more motivated to do well on the test. Saeng is sort of like the plant, strives and worries in the winter and then blooms beautifully in the spring.  Also, I think the memories that the winter hibiscus plant brought her; motivated  her to stop staying in the past and move on towards the future.
0	He  wrote this  because  he is talking  about weather changes
2	The author probably conclude the story with that paragraph b/c she is basically relating the plants to herself meaning as the plant bloom she will too by taking the test. and her reason could be b/c or is b/c reluctantly she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quite repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now. Basically she did as the geese by lifting her head watching as their distinctive V was etched against the evening sky, slowly facing into the distance. This is why I believe the author but this to conclde the story...because she was comparing herself ib the geese and does as they did 
1	The author describes last quote because he wants her dream to achieve. We describes ”she realized that many of the things that she had thought the quiet repetition of season, almost familiar to her now. Saeng is from Vietnam, and her family have an @CAPS1 dream. so the author wants that her family adapt their new life in @LOCATION2.
8	Dear local newspaper, I agree that computers benefit us totaly. This lets people explore the world and do anything. Also, computers are used for many things. Last but not least @NUM1 out of every @NUM2 households have at least one computer. So computers lets us do anything and everything. It helps most people with their jobs, college/school, and you can even buy a house or car online. It doesn't cost that much and its very usefull. You can look up facts you need or even play games when your bored. It keeps us in touch with the world. Also, many thing require a computer. For example, In order to play xbox live you need a computer with @CAPS1. Xbox live lets you play video games with other people or even your friends. Some homework requires computers and some colleges are only on the computer so you can stay at home. Anything you need you can find it on the computer. @NUM1 out of @NUM2 house hold have computers, or @PERCENT1 of @LOCATION1 does. I agree that some people waste their time, but without computers everything would be much harder. For example, say you need to having to wait @NUM5 days for the mail. Just @CAPS2-mail it. Most people wouldn't have a job if it weren't for computers. It saves peoples time and lets them do other things except have to drive somewhere to give a letter to them. So I think computers are a huge benefit. Like I said you can do anything. Like @CAPS3. It keeps you in touch with friends if your on vacation from school. They are also used for several different things like downloading music on your @CAPS4. Also, @CAPS5 everyone has a computer. If scientists are going to complain about computers than why do they use them? I think computers are great! But whats you opinion?
0	She says this because right now it is winter and flowers can grow in the winter due to how cold it is. So she is saying when spring is back she will take the test of growing the flowers again. In conclusion, this is why the author states that conclusion at the end of the paragraph.
3	The author ends the story with that paragraph to give you a sense of hope and determination for the future that dwells within saeng at that time .Throught  the story is seemed as though saeng was giving into despair at the remembrance of her home land ,she wasnt doing so well in her new country and and she had realized it the  most when she had “failed her driving test “.but when she  walked past the flower shop and saw all the plants that used to bloom so freely and beautifly  in her home  land comfind  in those ting pots and fighting to survive it reminded her of  herself here in @LOCATION1. As she began to plant her hibiscus she again compared herself to it and that is why when her plant blooms on the spring so well she will pass that test   
1	The author conclude this saying it to the story because he thought it would go because at valkay about how the hibisuse a yet budding in the winter &amp; and how all at the geese will return to the home and stay there because they hate the winter.  
2	The author concludes the story using that paragraph for a few reasons. One reason why is because the change in Saeng‘s attitude. In the beginning of the story Saeng is upset and has no hope of adjusting to her new home, but by adding that paragraph at end of the story it shows that she has hope, and she’s not going to give up. Another reason why this paragraph concludes the story is to show that life does go on in toughest situation. The fact that a new season will begin figuratively shows Saeng will not always feel this way that she too will change. In conclude the story with that paragraph for a few good reasons.
2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph I think because since the girl failed her test the bud reminds her of her grandmothers long grey hair and I guess that gives her good luck so when the winter passes by and the spring time hits thats buds start to come back out and thats when she will take her test again. Thats why the author made this statement the last sentence of the story.
1	I am going to tell you why the author concludes the story with this paragraph. One reason the author does is because it tells you that Saeng is confident. It also tells you she wont give up. And it shows that she is willing to take her ability to the next level. This is why the author concludes the story with the paragraph. 
2	THE AUTHOR MUST LIKELY INTENDED TO SHOW THE HOPEFUL ENLIGHTENMENT OF SAENG'S COMPLEX DILEMMA. IN THE PHRASE, &quot;WHEN THEY COME BACK&quot; THE AUTHOR MUST LIKELY REFERS TO THE HIBISCUS FLOWERS THAT REPRESENT THE FOND MEMORIES OF HER HOMELAND. THE AUTHOR ILLUSTRATES SAENG'S STRUGGLE ADAPTING TO HER NEW LIFE THROUGH A “TEST” OF PLANTING THE BUDS JUST AS SHE HAD DONE BACK HOME WITH HER GRANDMOTHER. THIS TEST REPRESENTS THE ACHIEVEMENT OF ADAPTATION TO HER NEW LIFE. FOR THAT REASON, THE AUTHOR CONCLUDED HER STORY WITH THE PARAGRAPH INDICATING SAENG WILL INDEED TAKE THAT TEST AGAIN.
3	The author decided to conclude the story with this paragraph to show Saeng’s determination to adapt to her new life. In the third paragraph on the second page the author writes, “Saeng looked at the white bud in her hand now, small and fragile… That atleast, she could hold onto.” After failing her driver’s test Saeng was feeling foreign and alone. She desperately looked to the flower as a reminder of her homeland, Vietnam. The flower brought back comforting memories for her, so she bought one of the plants and returned. After a discussion with her mother Saeng understands that she must cope with her new home, much like the flower must adapt to its new surroundings. By concluding the story, with that stated sentence, the author is informing the reader that Saeng must “blossom” in her new home in order to do well. She still needs time for this, as the flowers needs time to plant its roots into the ground.
1	The author concludes the story with this paragraph. Maybe to show confidence that she would do everything over again if she had to. For example &quot;When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring , when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again&quot;, so basically she's saying she's willing to take that step, that chance . The author ended the story with this confidence and couragement..
1	The author concludes the story with the paragraph, “When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, the I will take the test again.” She does this to end in hope of taking the test again and doing good. Also the author ends it this way because Saeng is believing in herself so she made a vowe to do something. Hopefully that will encourage her more and also motivate her.
9	Dear @CAPS1, &quot; Computers are great! They do so much for my family and me, i can't live without a computer.&quot; @CAPS2 my many local in the town of @LOCATION1. For me, computers are a place to have fun with all the different applications. But they can also be used for researching anything you can imagine. I also think tha computer is important because it is where businessmen do their job. My favorite part about the computer are applications like @CAPS3, @CAPS4, @CAPS5, and so many more. These apps. are great because on @CAPS5, you can talk to your friends if you don't have a cellphone, or talk to friends that live in another state, @CAPS3. Easily my most favorite application, because I get to talk to my friends, look at pictures of them, see who they are dating, and so many other endless possibilities, You can also play and download games onto your computer. It's always very fun to do things on the computer that you enjoy, and not have to research all the time. The second thing on the computer, is research. Researching can be fun and boring, however you look at it, But researching is educational, and I asked a mother with a @NUM1 year old, a @NUM2 year-old, and a @NUM3 yearl-old and she said &quot;The most important thing to me on the computer is researching. Its's fun, enjoyable, and most importantly, educational!&quot; The best thing about researching is that, there are endless amounts of websitees that have information for us to look at, and enjoy. People that work and have jobs, are mostly the ones on the computer, and a lot of them ar researching while working. People that work, are th ones that are basically on the computer @NUM4. Businessmen, designers, etc.... The computers are mostly used by workers for e-mail. My father is always on the computer, checking e-mails, typing something for this boss; and even talking on a video conference. There are endless possibilities for workers because foe some of them, computers are their jobs. Computers, in my opinion, they'are one of the best things created. They are the best because they ahve amazing apps. for me to have fun on. But they also provide an educational opportunity through research. And they are great for people with jobs. I don't think there is any person that can live without one of these technological beauties.
1	The author of this story concludes the story with a paragraph basically stating that the winters coming things are going to die off then come back next spring. Shes refering to the plant. I think she is basically keeping track of the memories it left her and the thoughts that came to mind when she used her senses to connect with the flower. Saeng is ancious to see how the flower buds next spring and what other new things she @MONTH1 experience.
1	Well I think the author concludes the story like that because he is showing her her attitude better known now she is changing so she is going to put her mind to whatever she has to do and she is going to take the test again with some pride and try in the spring when the snow goes away.
2	The author decides to end the story with the paragraph to show many things. First of all, the author uses the ending paragraph to show optimism. The whole story had been sad but the ending shows some hope. In the beginning it says, “ @CAPS1  of loss so deep… “(@NUM1) and at the end it says, “ I will take that test again.” (@NUM2) shows how her  attitude   changes from cynical to hopeful. Another reason why the story is ended with that paragraph is to show how Saeng was accepting. When the story says that the geese were  , “ almost familiar to her now.”(@NUM2) demonstrates that even though Saeng is sad to leave her home, she is adapting quite well. Therefore, the author ends the story with an inspiring paragraph to show change for the better.
1	The author is concluding the story with that parapraph stating when spring and @DATE2 comes again then she will take the test again. Meaning she will plant the flowers and get them to grow again. Hoping she don’t fail at doing so. For example, &quot;Mrs. Lambert, liked it. this sharp bitter melon that left a golden after taste on the tongue.”
1	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because he wants to end it on a good note and send a good message there not going to quit because they failed the first time.
2	I say the only reason why the author included that last paragraph was to show she was not going to give up easy. She was still going to take it again, she might get good luck from the hibiscus. Saeng was walking home one day from failing her driver’s test and she realizes that she recognizes a flower so she went to a florist to see if she can buy it. When she does purchase it she goes home and gives it to her mom and they plant it. So maybe it can bring back good memories from her home town or just good luck I think.
3	The author concludes the story wt this passage because its symbolic. When the Geese come back in the spring it will be like a now beginning. When the Hibiscus is budding it has a new life. When all this happens Saeng will have a new fresh start too. Leaving the story to end like this is a cliff-hanger for some. It makes you wanting more, knowing she failed her test you want to know if Saeng will pass it in the spring, @CAPS1 a fresh new start. Everything and everyone will have new starts when the beginning of the new season comes around when the hibiscus blooms it will be like she has the new ability to overcome obstacles, new connections w/her past and comfort during hard times. The Hibiscus symbolizes all this
0	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because this is what the story was all about. Saeng saw what happens in the winter and when it comes back around she trys to memorize it so that she can no what will happen.
1	The author ends the story this way because by the time winter ends she will have adapted to her new society, just like the hibiscus.
2	The young girl Saeng from the story &quot;Winter Hibiscus” by minfong Ho, has moved from her home land of Vietnam to the United States. The young girl was hoping to get her drivers license but failed, The hibiscus she sees comforts her reminding her of Vietnam. When she purchases it her mother is concern of the price but sees how home sick her daughter is and becomes understanding. After planting the Hibiscus She watches the geese and understands that every year they change their habitat. The geese inspire Saeng along with the Hibiscus and promises herself that&quot; in the spring when the snow melts away the geese return and thes Hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again.
11	Dear local newspaper, @NUM1 out of @NUM2 students at @ORGANIZATION1 say that they spend most of their time on the computer. I think computers have a bad effect on people because they can cause safety issues, health issues, and ofcourse education issues. With all this new technology, teenagers aren't aware of their surroundings at all. On top of that, they're not aware of what's happening to them. Adults also do use the computer, but not as frequent as us teenagers. It's time now to realize what computers are doing to us and the world today. Computers can cause safety issues. Now more than ever people use where they talk to friends. But, what they don't know is that the person on the other side might not be what they think it is. Lately, on the news we hear of teenagers getting raped or kidnapped because of people who they were talking on the internet was not who they said they were. Bad people are always lurking on the internet, and we need to prevent them from getting in contact with the kids. But, even besides having bad people online, computers can with your privacy. It's possible for computers to give out your information to other people so, we really need to watch out. Computers though not only cause safety issues, but health issues also. Computers play a major part in destroying our health. About @PERCENT1 of @CAPS1 are overweight or obese. T.V's use to be the issue for people not excercising, but now computers are doing just the same. There are so many things to do on the computer that just doesn't make you bored. That there means that there is no way to from it. But, you need to get up and exercise and computers are preventing people from doing so. It's like it's hypnotizing us because we simply don't want to get up. Computers can also have an impact with your vision. I know that after a long time on the computer I have a massive headache because my eyes just hurt so bad. Also, computers can make people stop talking to each other verbally. Talking and interacting makes us have safe relationships with one another, but computers again are preventing this. Besides interfering with our computers do the same with education. Computers can really be bad with our education. Students now easily forget to do homework. There are so many distractions today that than of them whom people spend a long time on it, we forget to do other things that we're suppose to do simply becausewe're distracted. But, eventhough we forget our homework, we also @MONTH1 forget to study before a test. This would result in a in high grades. Computers shouldn't be distracting people, but instead helping them. I think it's not the people to not get distracted on the computer because it just has so many interesting features. For example, the internet, and websites like @CAPS2, @CAPS3 @CAPS4, etc. We have so many distractions in our that we don't need more! Computers really don't have a good effect on people. More and more people get computers everyday. They should know what its doing to them, and what's happening to the world around them go outside and enjoy nature? Maybe, go to the mall with friends and. There are a variety of things to do rather than staying glued to the computer the whole day. People need to stop being and open their eyes to see the effect computers have on people.
2	The author uses this paragraph because it works perfectly as an end. Wit  this saeng tell @LOCATION1 that all the snow is gone she will take the test again. If one read   now between the lives it   says more than just this. She really likes the hibiscus and when the hibiscus goes back to life in the spring, she will have new energy to take the test again. From her experience with the hibiscus we can see that this plant really influent her. Because this  plant reminds  her so much of her old home.  Also we can see that everything and everybody should get a second chance. In her case it is the test she wants to take again. Also in the spring she lives a couple month in the @LOCATION1 and she will adjust herself to this new situation. At the moment she is just homesick, even if her home is the @LOCATION1 now. So the hibiscus is good for her, it is some think she can hold onto from her old home… 
3	The author: minfong Ho, finishes the story like this to show the overcoming of obstacles. The story shows the many difficulties saeng faces when leaving her old home and comming to her new one. In the day described. She failes a drivers test, doesn’t eat lunch with her friend, and spends all her money on a plant from her old home. Also, this paragraph shows how the Hibiscus symbolizes her. The plant is not in its native home, faces many difficulties; the cold its small pot, and even its general surrounding. In every way, the plant is in the same circumstances as main character and the last paragraph is used to link them.   
0	The reason why the author used this paragraph is because he was sag that the snow go away in spring time that all.
1	The last paragraph means only one thing. That one thing is to be like a Hibiscus @CAPS1 to take the test again of life. See will come back in the spring just like the Hibiscus will. So as you can see the last paragraph had a very good meaning to it.
1	The auther concluded the story with this paragraph because this shows that Saeng is willing to change and she wants to do so by the time spring comes. By change Saeng wants to feel comfertable in @LOCATION1 and be able to remember things from where she used to live and not have to break down and cry. Also the author use the geese because they need to leave home earely year and they deal with it so Saeng can deal with it as well.
2	The reason why the author ends the story with that statement is because when you fail at something you need time to dust yourself off and try again. When Saeng fails her driving test she is disappointed. After failing her test she went too greenery where she saw flowers of her homeland. Then where sh bought the hibiscus. It reminded her of how things were different. And how thing change when you go to different place. Sometimes they aren't so pleasant at first but you get use to them. Like when she first saw the geese flying in a &quot;V&quot;. she though of how strange it was. But now it is farmiliar to her. After failing her driving test Saeng learns that even though things nav change she needs to be able to try again. 
1	She concluded the paragraph with that paragraph to show that she is serious about her gardening and that she won’t garden until geese come back.
0	The author concludes the story with the paragraph they did, because Saeng is a nature freak. So she really likes nature and she would never ever hurt nature in her life and I guess that they wanted to end off with a nice paragraph. So she needs to take that test again.
2	The author concludes this story because it shows her determination. It says that she will keep on attempting to make an adjustment to her life till she accepts her new home. It also says that as the buds grow so will she. But her more mentally then physically. And her taking the test again is meaning that she has faith in herself that she will mature and grow up to be a person who misses their home land but accepts the new home that they live in. That is why the author ended this way.
1	She is saying here that she will start a new leaf when spring comes around she is going to start a new leaf and she is going to do better on her driving test. I think she concluded with this paragraph because this shows that Saeng is not a quiter and she going to try harder. 
8	Dear @CAPS1, I am writing you this letter to give you my opinion on computer use. In my opinion, I think that some people use and rely on computers too much. Wether it be for a research project, talking to friends, and even answers for homework. Everyday millions of people are on the computer for hours straight. Moving your fingers doesnt count as exercise and it wastes energy. Many people I know would die if they didn't have a computer because friends are on or made because they need if for homework. These type of people need to be taught how to get things done withou technology because are day it might fail. Some students rely on there technology to work orthey will fail. These children need to be taught that there is other ways to do things. Like hanging out with friends, reading a book, and even doing their homework. Since students rely on their computers so much then always on them. Every day people I know go home and jump on @CAPS2 for the rest of the day. They never can do anything like going outside and doing sports. Many kids do not do any type of athletic sport. Obessity is a huge problem in the @LOCATION1 are the numbers keep increasing drasticlly. Everyone thinks that it is beging caused by bad eating habbits, thats only half of it. People overusing their computer is also a big problem. Children around the @LOCATION1 are stuck on their computers all day checking message, and seting up pictures. While these children are on the comptuer they dont even think they just chow down on &quot;@CAPS3&quot;. This comptuer usage problem is beging to become at bigdeal with the obessity and hold much people rely on it for basically everything. So we need to be the first people to stop this befor it forms bad. This could be a huge problem in the future. So lets start to cut our usage time down now.
3	Reserved need to check keenly
0	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because the cold was brufield or the  author never  wanted to be around while the cold was in sesion. At the  time it was realy cold
2	I believe that the author concludes the story with this paragraph for many reasons. One being the fact that she wants to snow sympathay for the hibiscus. Another reason would be showing that Saeng wants to make her mother very proud of her. Meaning that she doesn’t want her mom to think that she is going to give up. This also contributes to the reason that Saeng believes in herself and she truly thinks she can pass the test. Lastly I think that this last paragraph snowed how Saeng wants people to know that even some as small and meaning less as a plant can help her overcome obsticles, and lead her to her dreams. The author chose this paragraph to end the story because of the main fact that how we know that Saeng will not stop believing in herself.    
3	The author of the story, chooses to end the story with that sentence because the story is mainly about how Saeng failed her drivers test, but when she saw the hibiscus, it reminded her of home and made her feel better. In paragraph @NUM1, Saeng says, “And that rich, sweet scent – that was familiar too,&quot; talks about how nice the flowers were and how familiar they were because she reconized the scent. Saeng was already upset about leaving her home in @LOCATION1, then coming to @LOCATION2 and then failing her drivers test, just made it worse, but then she saw the flower and it reminded her of her home, so she felt a little better. So when the author uses that quote, they end the story that way to show that she will have enough courage to try again when the flower blooms.
2	The author concludes the story like that to show emphasis.Saeng vowed that so that it will teach her everything lives with hope &amp; adaptation. She means that when everything returns and proves they survive, she will too. She will take that drivers test then. The author also wants to prove that people need to have faith in theirselves. You just need to get used to their surroundings. This is why the author concluded that way.
2	In stories, author lend them many different ways with many different effects. In the story, Winter Hibiscus the author concludes the story with this paragraph because it has a “touching” affect to the reader and it basically sums up all the paints talked about in the story. The first example, is in the beginning of the conclusion, it says “Saeng vowed silently to herself”. In this unique quote, the author demonstrates imagery by giving you a mental picture of a silent lonly girl nealing down in the cold garden, whispering silently to herself. This quote and this part of the quote has a touching effect to the reader. Another example of why the author concludes the story with this is because it sums up all the parts covered in the story. &quot;When the geese return hibiscus is budding I will take that test again” This quote mentions the hibiscus which is mentioned a lot throughout, the geese in the end, and the failing of the test in the beginning. In conclusion, that’s why the author used that paragraph as the conclusion for such a touching story.
1	The author concludes in the story that Saeng failed a winter test and because of her love of the hibiscus plant spring will help her take test.
1	I belive the author concludes the story with this paragraph because. She wanted the reader to know that just because she failed that it doesn’t mean her lifes over. She will requperate and to the same thing next year.
2	The author uses this paragraph to conclude to show she’s going to give the test another try as well as her new surroundings. For example the story says “Almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon, almost fimiliar to her now”. Saying that she is getting used to where she is now and wants and is willing to give it a chance. Almost as if she doesn’t find it that bad as she thought at first it being different and not her home and where she was used to being.  
1	Maybe the author wrote that as the last sentence or paragraph because in the story she did something and failed at it, so she wants to do it again.
8	Dear @CAPS1, I think computers aren't good for people because they could spend that time exercising, hanging out with friends and family and reading. The first reason I don't think computers are good for people is because they could spend that time exercising instead of @CAPS2'ing you could ride your bike or even walk the dog, exercising @MONTH1 be hard work but, it's better then staring at your computer screen. Just because you eat well dosen't mean your healthy. You need exercise to stay healthy too. So, run, ing, walk the dog, go to a gym instead of sitting at the computer. Another reason I think computers aren't good for you is because in the time your on the computer you could be hanging out with your friends and family. Lets say your family is going to the beach, you stay home to play games on facebook. Your family comes back talks about all the fun they had, even tho you weren't there. You could have been apart of those memories. Now time to compare with your friends. Its movie night, all your friends are going. But, you stay home to webcam with your aunt. You stayed home both times just to be on the computer. You missed out on a lot. My final reason I think computers are bad is because, instead of computer time it should be reading time. Looking at a computer screen and reading is a lot different then reading a book. Reading books increases your vocabulary, you learn about different types of litature. Over all reading books makes you smarter. When your reading online you just read what people say, basically rumors. READ! In conclusion I think people should spend more time exercising, hanging out with family and friends and reading instead of being on computers.
2	The Author of “Winter Hibiscus” ends this story with that closing paragraph because it wraps up all the themes. It shows that Saeng has determination to overcome obstacles and it uses the plant as a metaphor, just like the rest of the story, the Hibiscus represents Saeng or adjusting to change. The plant “dies” in the winter and this is equivlent to @PERSON1 not getting her drivers licens, but the plant will come back, representing determination or adjustment, this is why Saeng says she will go back and pass the test because she has adjusted and is now determined to overcome this obstacle.
1	After reading the quote &quot;when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test. From the story &quot;winter' Hibiscus&quot; by Minfong Ho, I think the author is trying to say that after the winter and fall pass she will be upto the challenge to plant again and feel good about herself. She lifted her head and watched as their distinctive &quot;V&quot; was etched against the evening sky, slowly fading into the distance. Reflecting back I feel Saeng felt that the geese was secretly letting her know what she was doing was right.
1	He ends the story this way to show that she wants to and is willing to overcome leaving her homeland. In the story she goes to a green house. She is in the green house to test herself. She finds a plant from her homeland and and it reminds her of her grandmother. She finds other plants and they remind her of her homeland and she cries. I think she had a real connection with her grandmother. When they left their home country she probably cried for days its like she lost a part of her sole.
1	The author includes this paragraph into the story because the girl started giving up on herself and felt sad from moving to the United States and also from failing her drivers test, but lastly about the plant that she bought that wasn’t real. Also because he wanted to show that her self esteem had gone up and that she was more confident and wasn’t gonna give up on herself.
2	The author leaves the story with those words, because it shows the reader a large metaphor in the story, although unfinished, it is self-explantory that the “metaphor” compares Saeng and her test to the perenial nature of the winter hibiscus. They both have something in common, which is that they both come back, Saeng comes back to complete her test, while the winter hibiscus comes back, buds, and lives again. I can relate to this, because I remember I entered in a triathalon, and my goal was to place first, I place @NUM1 overall, then next year came, and I trained until the triathalon came again, and I placed @NUM2, so like the winter hibiscus, I came back and completed my goal.    
0	The Author includes that part in his story because it’s talking about na ture and a the beuttifl thing's in natural. Ther’s the @CAPS1 @CAPS2's, tall green grass the white @CAPS3 fence and in the story there are those sanne type's of things that been in nature.
1	The author views the hibiscus plant as a new start. For example, when she says “In the spring, whch the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” @CAPS1 she failed the first time and got the plant the next time she’ll pass it.
0	The author include these paragraph in the story because the it spring, when the snows melt and the geese return. I think the author is talk about winter when it snows and keep snowing until spring hit and then the snow start to melt a way because the sun came out. One reason, is the author is talk about how it change weather when it changes.
1	She was upset with herself because she bought the hibicus and not the plant seeds. So she starts crying because she remembered how pretty their old one used to be. When the snow melts and the flowers start to bloom is when she is going to take the test again. The author ended the paragraph like that to show a new begining next year.
1	I believe that she included this because she wanted to show important it was to her. For example when she says in the spring she will take the test again. I think that ment she will work harder to make sure she does everything right. So that she can say she follows through on things that are important to her. These are my thoughts on why she included this paragraph in the story.
9	@ORGANIZATION1, In today's age computers are seen everywhere and they have been so helpful. They act as an information highway and connect people together. The new advances in technology have had a positive effect on humans all over. First off, computers are an easy way to have a universe of information at your fingertips. @PERCENT1 of students at @ORGANIZATION2 say that when assigned or paper or project the first source they use is from the internet. The internet is fast, simple and reliable when you know how to use it.&quot; said student @PERSON1. Children from the age of @NUM1 and up are learning how to use the internets multiple online encyclopidias, amagazines, newssites or other resources to get information. I remember my kindergarden computer class where we'd reserch dinnosaurs and weather patterns on kid friendly websites. And now being in middle school we use websites like @CAPS1 Online for up to date reliable information. Moreover, I've seen my mom, a nurse and hospital manager, use the internet for videos and articles on how to do certian procederes and ways to orginnaize a productive hospital. The internet is a great way to have a highway of information at the touch of a button. Furthermore, computers are used as a way for people to stay in touch. @PERCENT2 of teenagers say they talk to other peers using @CAPS2, @CAPS3, @CAPS4 or @CAPS5. Its a great way for us to communicate with our busy schedules when we can't always get together. Also with parents losing jobs in this ecconomic downfall, kids are always moving. Last @DATE1 one of my best friends in the world moved all the way to @LOCATION1. I though we'd never talk again and I was so upset to say goodbye, but because of @CAPS6 and @CAPS5 we talk non-stop and have accually never been closer. And its not just for young people to fool around with friends but adults use social network too. They connect for buissness through the internet and talk about future deals or problems and even use it to connect with old friends they haven't spoken to since college or childhood. As you can see the internet has had many positive effects from doing reserch faster to connecting with old friends, computers ar helping everyone.&quot;
1	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because 1. Saeng failed the test. @NUM1. It takes time for a hibiscus to bud. @NUM2. It sound like a good end i not and plus she would not want to take the test in the snow.
1	The reason why the author concludes the story with this paragraph is to let the readers know that how Saeng @CAPS1 about the hibiscus. I thinks the author concludes this because he his telling the reader that the hibiscus gives saeng goodluck and with this good luck She will past the test. In the story it tells us how much saeng adores the plant For example when she got to the hibiscus She reached out and toched a petal gently. It Felt smooth and cool. Thats why the author use thal paragraph at the end to indicate how Saeng @CAPS1 and how it make her  feel confident.
1	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to leave readers guessing and wondering what will be next. You can tell by the tone of the last paragraph, “When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” The author seems to leave at tone of suspense.
2	By ending the story in the way the author has in the short story “winter Hibiscus,“ the author provides a sympathetic understanding for the reader of seang at her struggle to live in another country &amp; her sadness of wishing to be back home. I think the author was attempting to end the story with a strong feeling for a strong note of Saeng's personality to draw the reader back into what they had just read. For example, by repeating statement on the test saying “ I will take that test again,” the author gives us that understanding that Saeng has not given up &amp; lets the reader know she will stand &amp; live strong.
2	The reason why the author concludes the story with this paragraph is becaus now she has something to work for. The author could have also put this concludes the story with this paragraph becaus she must wait that long till she can take it again also Saeng could wait to wait to see the plant grow and get bigger and stronger. They are reasons why i think the author put that conclude with the paragraph.
1	The author concludes the story here to show that Saeng would not give up. She simpley set a time for her to try again. Saeng wants to make it in this world and wants to have a good life, so she tries new things
1	The story “Winter Hibiscus” is a good-day story about a foreign girl trying to adapt to @LOCATION1. She likes tropical flowers. The reason why the author chose to write the last paragraph like that is because it finishes the story right. That ending when the goes man away and the flowers start to grow she will try to fit in the spring.
1	I think the author used this paragraph for the ending because it’s  meaning fail odvestily Saeng  really like garden and it’s  something  special to her . Also when all the snow  melts  she  will  take  the test  and  hopfully get her drivers  licesies.
2	I think the author concludes the story with this paragraph because new beginnings.What I mean by this is,the hibiscus represents new beginnings.She says “When the hibiscus is budding ,then I will take the test again “.This will be a new start for her  .The plant  blooming makes her happy and reminds her of her grandmother.She’s saying by the time the spring comes around she  would be ready for a  new obstacle as so for the hibiscus plant.
2	I believe the author chooses to end the story wit this paragraph because it symbolizes closure. The plant represent her home. But she realizes  by the sight of the geese, flying sooth that evenyone has to leave home at some point. She has now come to terms with what is happening and she will try again for her drivers liscence soon. When the hibiscus buds again it will by symbolic to her and that is when she will be ready to try once again.
8	Dear @CAPS1: Have you been sent a photo of a @NUM1 year old child with no clothes on? Well, if you have this is called sexting. It can be put on the computer or any type of device. People should stop using Computers more because it can lead to bad things like sexting from teens, bad for the younger kids, and teens could be, talking to someone they don't know. Lexi @NUM1, says that &quot;she has goting facebook texts to her cell phone of other teenage kids that are excuset&quot;. @PERCENT1 of @LOCATION1 population teenagers have @CAPS2, @CAPS3 and @CAPS4 chat. Any of these websites can ford photos to their mobile device. This has goting out of the hand and what ever is on the computer now will be on forever. More childern under the age of @NUM3 years old are on the computer know. Where there are chat rooms were they can interact with others. For example, @PERSON1 is a childerns game that has a chating interaction, were you can talk to who ever. But, we you create this @PERSON1 you child has to give a parents email address were they have to read the following terms to chose for their child. But, most parents don't even read it . @PERCENT2 of these parents just agree to these terms and don't even read them. @PERSON2, was followed home from soccer practice when a man about @NUM4&quot; and around the age of @NUM5 said &quot;@PERSON2 come get some candy&quot; @PERSON2 said &quot;how do you know my name&quot;? &quot;@CAPS5 said cause I play with you all the time&quot; @PERSON2 quickly ran home and @CAPS5 told his parents. @PERSON2 plays on @CAPS6 another intraction game and told this stranger @CAPS5 lives in @LOCATION2 field and @CAPS5 goes to @LOCATION2 @CAPS7. Giving strangers you information they can trace you down and find the street you live on. We need to keep our children safe and off of the computers more so sexting, and young children stay off, so kidnapping stops. Help @LOCATION1, @CAPS8 to become a safe place for our childern.
8	Dear Local Newspaper, I believe the computer does have positive perks, but it also has negative perks. Reason one you loose interaction with people. Reason two you then forget to excersize. Reason three, your health is in jeopardy. Firstly, you loose interaction with family and friends. Because you would spend so much time on the computers. It ruins your marriage if you are married. If you have kids you risk your relationship with them. I am not saying to stop using computers. Because I use them myself. I am saying don't make your life the computer. It's not good for you! Secondly, you need excersize. Stastics show @PERCENT1 of the people who live on their computers gain weight faster would know because as @NUM1 yr old I have gained a little weight because of computers. Most people when on the computer tend to eat more @CAPS1 are all well-known facts. That have been proven. Since, you can't walk with a computer in hand, you stop moving. Meaning you stop excersizing. You have to limit your time and then there is where I believe they (computers) benfit you. Lastly, your health is very much at stake. If you are at the computer for @NUM2 hours at a time your eye-site will pay. My eyes stink when I am on the computer for half an hour. Doesn't your head hurt when you are the computer for so long? Yes, the computer is fun and it gives you things to do, I am the first one to admit that But, it also hurts your heath. For being on the computer for so long you are at risk for carpal tunal syndrome. Which is very painful. Computers are so much fun and make life easier. But, they have disadvantages. Reason one you loose interaction with people. Reason two you stop excersizing. Reason three your health is at risk. If you limit time, everythig will be alright!
1	I believe the author concludes the story with that paragraph because she’s showing she is trying she wants another chance. She realized her mistake’s and ready to start over, Even though she faild by trying to grow her hibiscus in the winter she is trying to start over when the @DATE1 comes in. for example in the story. It stated the &quot;winter hibiscus&quot; was in the ground now, and saeng tamped down the soil around it over head, a flock of Canada geese flew by, their faint honks clear and yes familiar to saeng snow. That is why the author concludes the story with that paragraph.
2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because she thinks it’ll bring her good luck in the test. When she goes back to take the test she’ll have the comfort of her home land of the hibiscus plant to encourage her to pass the driving test. When she takes the test again she’ll ve mast to pass due to the comfort of home and she’ll be used to the area being different from her homeland. In order for her to do well in the test she needs something to help her have a little but more confident in herself. Having things to remind her of home and the house that she lives at now can help her a lot in being confident in herself.
1	She said that she was going to take the test agen because to show her mom that she can do it and Past it this time. instad of worring over her old home.
2	I think that this snows hope because she had really missed her homeland and kind of found peace and serenity by being around them she says “That at least she could hold on to” meaning the bud I think that she was very upset because of missing home she missed having her grandmother wash her hair and put a dok mallk into it. I think that since she really had nothing else but the flowers that reminded of her homeland the text said “where was the fine toothed come the hibiscus hedge, the well. her gentle grandmother she was missing all these thing so I think that by putting her in this posistion it has brought her to a place of where she not only misses the people from her homeland but the beautiful things as well and how she always has kind of a part of home with her because of the flower.
2	In the last paragraphy the reason why the author uses &quot;when they come back, in the spring when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, I will take that test. The author uses this because Saeng finally had found comfort. after  moving from a her homeland veelnam to the united States, she felt home sick. For example, she comes across this flower that reminds her of the time she spent in her homeland. She remember he grandmother's smell because of the plant. So when she finally got home to her mother, she showed the flower to her. They both planted the flower, and @CAPS1 got a sense of relief. Thats why she vowed that when winter was oven and spring came she would take that test, because she had a sense of home in her, that gave her uncouragement and strength. it also shows that even when your are in a different area and you are chew, there's always something that can male you remember the unemove and lime spent where you can from
1	The author concludes the story like this because it show that she is determined to do pass the test. It is also like if the birds can fly south she can pass that test.
2	The author concludes the story with the paragraph, “When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” The author does this for several reasons. The author wants to show you that Saeng still has hope and that she believes she can make it right. Also, to show Saeng will still try and adapt to her surrounding and make friends. Saeng is also, determined that she will pass the test next time she takes it. Last it is emphazing the conflict and how Saeng overcame it.
2	I believe the author ended this story with this paragraph because life lives on. &quot;When the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,&quot; proves that shes moving on with life and so will all the creature in the world. Also even knew she moved to a new country doesn’t mean she cant still enjoy the things from her homeland, “but she had grown up eating it and, she admitted to herself, much preferred it to the Big Mac.” thats why the author put that last paragraph to show that life lives on.  
1	The author concludes the story w/this paragraph because she really isnt worried about when they take the test again, she’s only concerned w/the plants she picked out. Also, she knows that it will be a really long time before she takes the test again so that gives her more time to study and get more prepared and focused. The author also ends this article w/this paragraph because she wants to let the readers know that since she failed the @NUM1 time she will be back again to take it over and nothing will stop the author from failing.
2	It shows not to give up, it ends almost  the same way it began, it shows that people should not stay too attached to the past each are reasons why I believe the author concludes the story with that paragraph. It shows that people should not give up because even though she failed her test then she will try again later to pass it. Also the story ends the same way it begins by her taking the test or getting ready to which is a good way of writing. One last thing is that it shows that people shouldn’t become too attached to the past because if they look at one thing that reminds them of it they @MONTH1 fall apart, that is why she takes the test, to see if she can look at the familiar flowers without falling apart.   
6	@ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1 my name is @PERSON1 and I am writing to you because, I want to inform you about the benefits of having computers. I think that having computers is a great way for kids like me to learn more about things in the world. Having a computer also helps people in need and also inform people about far away places in the the world. I beleive if it wasn't for computers we wouldn't really know that much about our world. Computers also help us to send emergency messages across the world in @NUM1. Some people do not think that computers have an effect onour society but I for one think computers have a very positive effect on people. people also think that computers make people spend less time exercising, but I believe that it actually helps people to exercise because you can go gives different exercising techniques. In conclusion, I think that computers have a positive effect on society.
1	The author concludes the story with that paragraph to end on a happy yet motivating note. In the story Saeng says that she failed the test and was very dissapointed with herself. The test must have of been very important to her for her to be so dissapointed. The author also probably ended with this paragraph to show that Saeng is devoted in passing this test. Saeng seems like a sentemental yet reliable person. I believe that the test is to spend a minimal amount of money and she wants to earn respect from her mom. That is why taking and passing the test seems so important to Saeng. That is why the author ended with that paragraph.
3	In the story “Winter Hibiscus” the author concludes the story with the lines “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” The reason that the author concludes the test with these lines is because she is re-establing the symbolism of the plant. In the text it said that the plant budds in the spring, once it has time to grow and adapt to the new enviroment. Just as the plant needed that time so did the main character Saeng. She just moved from Vietnam and failed her drivers test. Saeng is very unsure of her new culture. For example she likes bitter melon it says. “But she had grown up eating it and, she admitted to herself much prefered it to a Big Mac.” She appears to think she is misunderstood an no one likes her, but just as the plant will adapt to this new life so will she.
2	The auther conclude the story by saying she will take the test again in the spring and uptill then vow silently because the spring reminded Saeng of home. In Vietnam there were many beautiful wild flowers. Sarng goes to the flower shop to get a peice of home. It said the flower's &quot;leaves quivering in the wind.” This shows that the plant was not the same because there were also no buds. She had just failed her driving test before this and needed hope, so al waiting till spring when the hibiscus will bloom again that will give Saeng a sense of home which will give her hope to do good on the driving test. 
0	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because Saeng whole world is the plants a since they are gone there is no motivation.
3	In the story “Winter Hibiscus,” the author concludes the story with, “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again. The author’s reasoning for saying this is because the presence of memories from Saeng’s homeland comforts her. So much that they she will pass her test with ease because she will not be nervous. “it was like walking into another world,” said Saeng, when she entered the florist shop, after failing her drivers test. It was almost as if she completely forgot about failing and was only thinking about the plants, flowers. The flowers take her to a happy peace and make her feel at home. Like everything is going to be alright. This is  why the author concludes with such a sentence because us as readers should show memories of her farmland will help her pass her drivers test.  
0	The author @MONTH1 have conclude the story like that because of the titel and the begening of the story. Or he @MONTH1 have conclude the story like that because he wants to. He @MONTH1 have concluded the story like that to show what @MONTH1 happen. But is good conclusion is a good conclusion. 
0	I really do not know why the author concludes the story with this paragraph. Possibly because she started to talk.
3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show Saeng’s determination. Saeng has been through a lot and misses what its like at home. She feels different and out of place but she is still strong. Life goes on, and this paragraph shows that Saeng with move with it. The paragraph says, “in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” Spring will come, as nothing can stop time. The snow will melt because the weather changes. The geese will fly home and the hibiscus will bloom in spring. Saeng takes a positive look at things and decides to join them. Sure she failed once but she is strong and willing to try again. If at first you don’t succeed, try, try again. Saeng will always have her memories of home but she is willing to change to her new sorroundings. The concluding paragraph shows Saeng’s determination to succeed and survive in the new world.
1	The author concludes the story saying that because she wants to show us that Saeng is confident in herself and will not hesitate to take the test again. She went over to the corner of the vegteble patch and started to dig a hole in the ground.
3	The author concludes  with this paragraph, to give a sense at hope and growth. The flower represents Saeng’s  homelard, and it makes her feel comforted. It connects her with her emotions and reminds her of the way are. The growth and flourishing of the hibiscus corresponds to the flourish of Saeng. When it blooms, she will have a true piece of home with her, and  will be able to take the test again. The story  is  about overcoming obstacles and adjusting to change. The visual, and nearly lyrical expression of the blooming hibiscus makes the reward and result of your struggles ‘seem so much more beautiful
5	Computers are good to use because it tells you everything. Like if you need a number to a restaurant you can just get it off the computer and sometimes when you wanna go on a vacation and if you wanna know how much it cost you go onto the computer. And computers are good because if you wanna travel to different places you can go onto the computer and look for a map and print it out. But sometimes computer are bad because when people go on web sites to chat peoples can be grown ups but talking to little kids. 
2	The author concludes this story with hope in this sentence. The begining was very negative with Saeng failing her drive’s test and her mother yelling at her. But when this sentence comes the reader is filled with hope for the young girl Saeng. The author does this to show that Saeng will adjust and will peservere wheras before she was so upset, @CAPS1 when she said, “I-I failed the test.” Then for Saeng to refound from this event, gave the reader hope and thats why the author did this.
1	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because the author is talking about how there will be a new start. Since Saeng failed the test and in the winter the plant will die in the spring the plant will bud again and she will retake the test. Its a new chance to start things over.
0	Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, saeng vowed don't really like to talk. Saeng liked to be by her self sometimes. When spring come it was a different story. Saeng loved the spring and @DATE2. She would play outside all day every day. Saeng was just a nice girl
1	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because it shows that character will retry what she failed. In the story the character loves gardening so when her favourite plant comes back she will retry to pass her test.
1	The author conclud the story with that because as winter come every thing goes away. Like the trees lose the leaves the geese fly south and the flower die off. So this passage is saying in the spring time when every thing comes back she will start the test again. it is like to start a new life back over.
2	In the story called &quot;Winter Hibiscus&quot; the author concludes the story with this paragraph &quot;when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, than I will take that test again.&quot; The reason why the author had put that at the end of the story was because when things go under ground everyone wants to wait and wait until it comes back up again because when you fail everything goes down but if you wait awhile than everything will start to raise Just like flowers and everything else that you can think of. So that is why the author put that at the end of the story cause to tell people that it is ok for people to fail Just as long as you get up and try again until you reach your goal. So that is what the author was talking about and thats why Minfong Ho put that at the end of the story so that people can read and learn for what it says.
1	The author concludes the story with that last paragraph to set the final mood. The author wanted to show that Saeng will not give up and she will continue to adapt to her new surroundings. It made the end of the story feel warm and it also inspired. The end of the story encourages the reader to not give up as well. The last paragraph sets an example of how the reader can vow to improve as well. The author knew that the last paragraph would stand as an inspiration and mabe help a reader going through something similar to the story.
3	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because to her the plant seems to remind her of her homeland which calms her and when it is budding she feels stronger. In the story Saeng is kind of an outsider and when she sees the plant she sees a part of her past back home. In the story it says she gets shaky when she tries to say “at home.” When she says “and this hibiscus is budding,” I think it is really saying when she is ready to accept this country as her home because the flower is a reminder of her homeland. At the end of the story it says how see is getting used to the geese flying in a “V” so she is getting more used to this country and when she is ready she will take her test again.
3	The author includes the paragraph, &quot;when they come back...then I will take that test again,&quot; to show that hibiscus is a symbol of time. Saeng uses the hibiscus to measure the amount of time there will be until she takes her test again.  The hibiscus also symbolizes the power to get through struggling (stay strong). Saeng had trouble with her test, but the hibiscus is there to help push her through it to prepare her for the next test. The hibiscus also helps Saeng's mother push through her hard time of seeing her daughter sad from not succeeding on the test. The plant helps the mother try and stay positive and it also helps the mother by trying to do the right thing for her daughter. In the story. the mother decides to plant the hibiscus in the garden to make her daughter happy. The hibiscus shows strong symbolism and it helps Saeng and her mother stay strong through out their struggles. 
1	This final paragraph goes along with one of the main premises of the story. To not quite and keep going in order to understand and be happy in this world. Saeng is taking this “test” to see if shes ready to change and adapt to her new environment. She failed this time. But when all is right and the hibiscus is ready she will try again to see if shes ready to let go of the old and be happy with the new.
9	Have you ever wondered what life would be like without computers? Some experts are concerned that people are using too much time on the computers. I believe we should still use computers. Without a doubt using a computer helps us learn. The computer helps us learn about other places in the world. @PERCENT1 of people say they would love to look at beautiful places in the world. Computers also can teach you how to speak a language. @PERSON1 of @ORGANIZATION1 says that &quot;taking spanish online helped im a lot on her class. Computers now offer online study groups that can help us get into a college. Many people would agree that using a computer helps us learn new things. Its a fact that you instead other people on computers. You meet new people when you are in the computer. Most people live meeting other people online. You also learn social on the computer. @PERCENT2 of people say they learn social on the computer. People also can learn to have a personality because they in use. @PERSON2 says that &quot;because I got on the computer I didn't have the personality but I feel like a whole person. As you interact with people on the computers. Did you know that a computer teacher in life say if you need to use a computer in your will one already. @PERSON3 says that using a computer helped you type. Using a computer helped hand eye coordination. You type a lot of essays in college too os that can help you as well. So now you know that a computer helps you in the future. Without a doubt people should still use computers are helpful in many ways. So what are you waiting for go out and go your computer today!
1	she said it because she didn’t do what she was sopose to so she said she failed her mother was mad for a second but then stopped she said I love it and asked if she wanted something to eat so the went inside but she took the task as a test so she said next time I will do it right.
1	I believe the author ended the story with the “test” because it is a big part of Saeng’s life or part of her tradition.
2	There are many reasons why the author concludes the story with that paragraph. First that ending gives a lot of emotion which doesn't cause people to think the story wasn't interesting. Another reason is that it shows strength. Not physical strength, but mental strength. Saeng is stating that even though she failed the test the first time she will take it again. Another reason the author @MONTH1 have used this paragraph to conclude the story is to show people to never quit. It shows how she failed and her mom was disappointed but she is not going to quit and take the drivers test again. Overall the author concludes the story with the paragraph because it gives off a great image to keep trying and never give up.
1	The author most likely concludes the story with this sentence because it shows how dedicated the author and her child are to gardening. I am guessing that the young childs favoriteplant is the hibiscus. I think that the mother and her childs favorite thing to do together would be gardening. This is a nice way to end a story. It gives the read kind of a look of question on their faces. It leaves them suspicious of why the author did that. But in my opinion I think it adds some curiosity to the story.
2	The find lines of the story, &quot;Winter Hibiscus,&quot; are meant to provide a glimpse into the near future, to show a change in Saeng's attitude. Up until this point Saeng had been lamenting her old country, and not adjusting well to her new one. The Hibiscus inspires her, and lets her know that the new country has many of the same things as her old country. In this last line, she comes to terms with her present situation. &quot;When the snows melts  and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding,&quot; is a way of saying shes going to let a little time pass, and by taking her driver’s test again, she will begin her new life.
2	The author concluded the story with saying that Saeng will retake the driving test in the spring to prove a point. When walking home from her test, Saeng saw a familiar flower and chose to make a delar to a flower shop. There, she saw many flowers that reminded her of home. she bought a hibiscus and went home. Her and her mother planted it, after saeng realized the flower could make it through the winter. She looked up to see many birds flying overhead and she realized that she has adapted to her life in @LOCATION1. The hibiscus has given her the will to survive and she knows she can adapt to life in @LOCATION1. The point the author wanted to get across was that the hibiscus gave courage and hope to retake her drivers test and continue surviving in @LOCATION1.
0	The reason I think author concludes this story with this last paragraph is because this is @CAPS1 passion. And that Saeng is very and will do this every year. She really love plants and she will wait to do it again. The last paragraph really showed a lot of dedication. And she really values the spring and the Hibiscus. 
3	The author concludes the story with this line to show that just like the hibiscus, adapting and strgging to survive and fit in in it’s non-natve land, Saeng will too. She will not give up her fight to pass the test to become a part of her new country. This is supported through out the story when her mother connents on the hibiscus by the late. She says, “It’s strong enough to make it through the cold month here, this winter hibiscus. That’s what matter” (Ho @NUM1). Here the author shows the comparison between the hibiscus' struggle through hard times in a foreign land similarly felt in Saeng’s life. Both must be strong fight through hard imes where no, one, “not even her class mates or frends, or Mrs. Lambert” (Ho @NUM1), understood how alone out of place she felt. So just as she vows to take the test again, shes promising herself she will fight through the hard times grow strong, just as her winter hibiscus.
2	Primarily why she said that was she was saying with time come s cause. She was basically saying in a while when things change again she believes that her performance could change as well. I depicted this by the idea you can tell that she is beginning to sit over missing her home in Vietnam and that is memory with time change comes along. That is a simple aspect of logic that with time comes chase. But I think as much I did properly interpret the aspect of what this is supposed to mean overall. But otherwise and finally I believed Saeng said this because time brings change.
2	The importance as to why the author ended this story like this was to show readers the importance of the plant. It seems that because the author is not in her native country that she doesn’t have a lot around in this new place that can comfort her. The author being able to find a hibiscus in a place she thought she wouldn’t be able to gives her strength to do anything that she can. It is possible that whatever the challenge @MONTH1 be that the author is trying to get by the fact that she has some support from the plant gives her the achievement and confidence to complete her task
9	Dear local newspaper, Have you even been on a computer too long &amp; haven't spent time excersising, or haven't spent any time with your family? Well, that's a big problem here in the @LOCATION1. In my opinion, to make this problem better, people should only be allowed on the computer for a certain amount @ORGANIZATION1 time &amp; after they enjoy themselves with a nice workout, time outside &amp; most importantly with their families. I think this will make the problem better, because you can enjoy yourself a little bit more rather than getting home from school &amp; shooting right to wherever your computer is &amp; being on it for the rest @ORGANIZATION1 the night. I also think this will help the problem because it will also allow you to get better grades. If your on computer all the time &amp; don't have any time to excersise, go outside, and bond with your family then that most likely means you have no time to do homework. By not doing homework, your grades could go lower &amp; you most likely won't understand what you are learning in that class. This one problem ran also affect you so many other ways. The problem with computers &amp; why people, mostly kids are so attached with them is because @ORGANIZATION1 websites such as twitter, facebook, youtube, etc. &amp; kids are @CAPS1 to them. This is part @ORGANIZATION1 the problem because kids can't get off @ORGANIZATION1 them, they like it so much. This problem leads to the main problem because if parents say &quot;Time to get off... go get some fresh air.&quot; the kid always goes &quot;one minute&quot; &amp; the parents let them get away with that, but then that &quot;one minute&quot; turns into an hour at most. This is bad because by the time the kid gets off the computer, its dark out and they can't go run around outside. I think this is important because think that facebook &amp; twitter should be limited amount @ORGANIZATION1 time and should log you off after @NUM1 minutes. In conclusion, this problem is a national issue &amp; in my opinion should be a new law, that kids have to play outside, and spend time with their families before going onto any computer. As you can see having all these great websites leads into a problem with kids. Thanks for your time on reading why I think computers are a big problem here in the @ORGANIZATION1.
2	The author concludes the story with this because the hibiscus and Saeng are very similar. Also the narrator compares her to the geese returning. The geese returning represents her starting over at drivers school and doing it again. The hibiscus represents her staying strong in the winter and the come spring she builds up and goes and takes the test again. That is what the narrator choose to end the story that way.
1	The reason why the author concludes the story like this for him/her to have a spin off. I mean to me I think that it mean she is going to try again when spring comes so her and her plant can have a fresh start and I think that is a good way to end it.
3	The author concludes the story with, “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” for several reasons. One reason the author concludes the story with this paragraph is because the hibiscus flower will be adaptating to spring just like Saeng should to her new environment in the United States. Another reason is like the hibiscus budding, Saeng has began to grow older and much wiser of things allowing her to go back in the spring and hopefully pass the driving test. Lastly, in the text it says, “she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quit repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now.” This shows Saeng is becoming familiar and at ease now of where she is living just how the hibiscus flower adapts to it's place with ease and gets use to seasons.
0	The author @CAPS1 the story with this paragraph because Saeng is saying that When She @CAPS2 @CAPS2 back she will take the test over again wich means that in form of test is that wile she was there it was a test of servle and when the story begains it is a the begaing of the test and at the end of the story the test and there leveing and she wants to come back to see what grew. The author is also saying that you don’t know how good you have it.  
0	Because the Winter hibiscus&quot; was in the ground how and Saeng tomped down the soil around it. overhead, a flock of canada greese flow by, their faint honks clear and -Yes- @CAPS1 to Saeng now. 
1	The author includes this paragraph in the story because it shows a impression on work ethic and adaption to a new environment can be difficult. “not even @PERSON1, looked it.&quot; makes something to dislike apparent to a student that is new don’t give them good. work ethic and that will essue them mentally also. Therefore the girl is not comfortable and not enthused To  working on something that none woud appreciate.
1	The author concludes with this because she is determined to pass the driving test that she had previously failed. For example, She writes “she vowed silently to herself.” When you vow to do something it usually means that you are very determined to do something. Everything else that she says after that she really means it. Therefore, that is why the author concludes with this sentence, in order to show her devotion to her goal.
1	The author of the story, Winter Hibiscus, concluded the story with that pharagraph because the author wanted to show that Saeng is finally going to start getting used to her new home. She won’t spend so much time dreaming about her past. “And in the warm moist shelter of the greenhouse, Saeng broke down and wept.” I believe that thats what she needed to get on with her life.
1	The author concludes the story with that paragraph to let us know when she’l take it again. When the season change is when she will take it again. Saeng is probably embrassed that why she wants to wait so long. Saeng took a long walk home and stoped at the flower shop. She tried getting her mind off failing the test. Saeng brought a nice flower/plant for @MONEY1. Her mother was upset at first, then realize her daughter wasn’t happy and changed her mood.
2	I belive that the author conclude the story with this because he is saying that she will keep trying and will not give up and will keep on trying. I say this because she just moved to america from Vietnam and is having a hard time adjusting to life in america. I think the geese represent something that is always  changing their surroundings and when they come she is going to fly again to get her licence.  
4	I think computers are good, because some people dont have phones so @CAPS1 a good way to conect with people you know, also meet new people. Second some people are going to collage when there done with high school so you could just look on the computers and find one you like and pricess, also find ways there. Third reason is ahopping if a holiday is coming up you could check online and find stuff for cheap and nice to you. You could also order it to your house online if you dont got alot of time to go shopping. @CAPS1 some reasons why I think online is good you could chat, find places and pricess, collages and also shop online @CAPS1 why online is good.
1	The reason why the author concludes the story with this paragraph is because now she has something to work for.The author could have also put this concludes the story with this paragraph because she must wait that long till she can take it again also Saeng could want to wait to see the plant grow and get bigger and stronger. They are the reasons why I think the author put that conclude with the paragraph
1	Saeng  would  silently in spring she will take the that again in the good ending to this story it was as goods ended  because the story had listed   come  of  malance  ready and spring it and of the plant beautiful  time the spring the all as plant ending because spring in a near trying and for the take the test again of that time , to think it’s a goods ending because the ruler strong are  about   machines saeng and spring it  and  makes  is near paragraph . That is why its is a good ending plant to the stays.   
2	The author ends with this because of what the hibiscus means to saeng. To her it is a symbol of strength and comfort. And she knows that if the hibiscus can survive the snow and the cold weather of the winter, she knows that she will not fail either. To her, the hibiscus is a symbol of herself and if it survives, she knows that she too can survive. She is also going to take the test again when the hibiscud are budding since it reminds her of her homeland and comforts her. Then even if she fails she will still be happy since her favorite plant is budding. I also think the author concludes the story this way, because both the plant and Saeng are going to have to overcome obstacles. The plant must survive the winter and come back in the spring. While Saeng must pass her driver’s test. Finally I think the author ended this way because of what the plant means to Saeng. If it survives she knows that she too will survive, and life goes on.
2	I believe the author concluded the story with “When they come back, saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the gesse return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again.” because it shows the entire theme of the story. The theme of this story is adjusting to things in life. The conclusion demonstrats this when she says she will take the test again. The hibiscus allowed her to get over the changes in life. For example “The familiar fragrance filled her lungs, and saeng could almost feel the light strands of her grandmother's long grey hair.&quot; The hibiscus was something from home that gave her good memorys. The hibiscus encouraged her to except her new life and keep trying to make it better. 
2	The author most likely concludes the story that way because that is the time that Saeng feels most comfortable. Saeng and her mom moved from Vietnam, were the winter Hibiscus are popular and familiar to Saeng. She ends the text in this maner because it remins Saeng about Vietnam, and how she feels better during that time of year. When she says “And beside it was yet another old friend.” She feels as if this plant is a friend to her and it makes her feel more comfortable. This is why the author ended the story in the manner that she did.
0	The author concludes the story with this saying because it will be a fresh start and it will be spring and beautiful. “@CAPS1 plant  it right now” is telling me that she wants another try. She wants a fresh strart and come spring when all of her pretty flowers are bloming and geting there chance she wants her now chance to pass best.
1	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because of her sadness  for what she did. The test she was telling about was how she was supposed to use the twenty dollars they had and buying one. Big @CAPS1  that she spent most of money besides after to buy a plant which reminded her at home and this last paragraph is saying that when she has the chance to do the “test” again, that she will do what she is supposed to do 
2	After reading ”Winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho. I believe Ho ended the story with that paragraph to support her idea of overcoming  obstacles. First after failing her driving test, Saeng was very upset and didn’t know if she would ever pass it. But after seeing a hibiscus plant, it reminded her of her home in Vietnam which inspired her. Second, when she bought the plant, her mother was a little angry because it was expensive. But, after seeing how the plant brought joy to Saeng, her mother forgave her. Last when saeng was digging a hole to let the hibiscus grow, it inspired Saeng to take the test again because she overcame the obstacles of brining the plant home and letting it grow. Therefore, I believe Ho end “Winter Hibiscus”, to go along with her idea of overcoming obstacles.
3	The last paragraph of the story displays the theme of determination. The Hibiscus reminded her that her &quot;home&quot; was her old life, but misses @CAPS1 in her new life. She gains determination through the reminder of this. She soon realizes that she is home, for things have come familiar to her, such as the V formation of the geese. She loved her old home, but she realized it was time to move on. The last paragraph does not only mean retaking a driving test, it symbolizes the determination to embrace her new home and life.  
1	I will take that test aGain. She has @CAPS1 confidence From The hibiscus and snow. When the snow melts and hibiscus buds. Then she will Go aGain kind oF GrowinG with the hibiscus so an in all she is @CAPS2 to have enouGh conFidence For the test.
7	Dear @CAPS1 I heard a lot of people are spending to much time in the computers and less time exercising, enjoying the nature, and interacting with family and friends. In my opinion I think you should know the compouter because it helps for school homework or projects, talking to family far away and finding new friends. My first reason why we should keep computers is because it @MONTH1 help on school homework or projects. This is my top reason because its really helpful and its useful when you need it also if your computer its not working you can go to your friends house and use computers, when your done you can save on hardrive and print it in your school's computers. My segond reason why you should keeps computer is talking to family. Without the computer you can't communicate with family. In my opinion computers are very helpful to cummnicate with family. If your phone is not working you can also use the computer to communicate with your family. My third reason is communicating and find new friends without the who are you going to meet and communicate with you can communicate with your family throught the computer, or even if your running late you can send them a message through the computer. In my opinion I think the computer its a really good way to communicate with your family. I know that people say they spend to much time in the computers and its addicting, but its good for school work like projects and assignments, also people said its just to what on the but in my opinion we should keep computers because its no to see whats on the other person. Its to do school work and talk to family. I know people spend to much time in computers but to other people its not. In my opinion, we should not get rid off computers because it good for doing school work and talking with family. I think what you should do its not get rid off computers.
1	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because they want people to know what happened in the story. Also because they want people to know what it might mean or say in relation to the story. The sentence means that when spring comes and when the snow might melt the plants will be out and budding but by next class or next school year he will come out and be brave and take the test all over again. That is what the sentence means of the story and how it might be compared to both things in different ways.
2	The final  paragraph in, “winter  hibiscus ”by @CAPS1  Ho reads  ” When  they  come back, Saeng  vowed silently,  to  herself,  in  the  spring,  when  the  snow  melts  and  the  geese  return  and  this  hibiscus  is budding,then I will take that test  again.”This paragraph compares  her to the flowers, which  shows that she is resilient like the flower is strong she is determined to take the test again next year and pass it. She would also take the test because it is comforting to her and reminds her of home
2	He ended the paragraph like that because he @MONTH1 want you to read on, or it could be that he is showing you the comparison between the flower and Saeng. &quot;When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when. the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again, &quot;The quote is showing the flower can fight through the winter and come back. Saeng failed the test once and is now going back to retake the test. Which shows that they both have modivation and the integrity to come back.
2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph, “When they com back, Saeng vowed silently to hersef, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, Then I will take that test again”. I believe the author concluded the story like this because it shows that the hibiscus represented to Saeng a new beginning and to restart what she had failed. When Saeng saw the hibiscus after failing her driving test, it gave her com fort in a time of disappointment, connection to her past experiences, and the abilities she could overcome her obstacles. Therefore, when the narrator says, “when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again&quot;, This implies a new beginning so the hibiscus is representing Saeng. This is why I think the author concludes the story with this paragraph.
3	The last line is included in the story “Winter Hibiscus” because it showed the connection between Saeng and the flower. Even though Saeng failed the driving test the first time she decides to take it again in the spring. The hibiscus flower like Saeng is out of place and will have to make it through the winter into the spring so it can bud again. This shows how like the flower Saeng will bud again in the spring by retaking the driving test. Another reason is that saeng and the flower are not used to the conditions in @LOCATION1. So they both have to weather the winter months they are not used to. This shows again how the last line connects the girl and the flower together. In conclusion, the last line is used in the text to wrap up the story with a connection between the flower and Saeng.
1	I think the author concludes the story with this statement because the author is determined to get used to the new country and surroundings. In the story, the author is showing home sickness. The author see a plant that is know where she come from and buy for over @NUM1 her mother couldn’t believe it. She didn’t want to tell her mother exactly why she got it because she was too shaky to say home or start crying again. The last sentence is showing that author is trying to adapt.
0	The author concludes with this paragraph because she/he wanted to close the story with a conclusion that portrays the story. The author talked about the hibiscus in the story as a “comfort in time of distress” a hobby or thing she likes doing with her spear time. In conclusion the author concludes with that paragraph for the reasons stated in the @ORGANIZATION1
3	The author ends the story with the given paragraph to get across. It highlights the things important and familiar to saeng that gave her comfort, and uses them to essentially say that she’ll take the test over again once she feels better. The winter hibiscus was a plant that saeng remembered of life back home up to the story, so when she sow the plant , “a wave of loss so deep and strong that it stung saeng ‘s eyes now swept over her.” Saeng was unable to comfort her emotions when she first saw the plant because she realized how much she missed her old life. The plant is mentioned in the final paragraph because when it blooms in the spring, the winter hibiscus will help fill the emotional void, and help saeng to try to take the test again. She also mentions the geese for the same reason, but in a different way. Unlike the winter hibiscus, it took a while for the geese to become, “through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now.” Saeng mentions this so that she can get used to the strange and unfamiliar parts of her life, and to come to grips with her failed test. Therefore by mentioning   the things she does in the last paragraph, saeng uses familiar objects, foreign and domestic, to illustrate her coming to grips with her failure.
2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph, because it expresses the meaning of the story. Life continues no matter what, the hibiscus will return again in the spring. The hibiscus is like a symbol to Saeng's life. The plant normally doesn't survive in winter months, but this one did. The mother says, &quot;It's flowers aren't as pretty, but it's strong enough to make it through the winter months here...&quot; Saeng and her mother are just like the plant. They are strong and their lives will continue even though they are in a  new environment The author chose to end the story with that parragraph because even  though she say the hibiscus will come back every spring the deeper meaning is that Saeng and her mother, like the hibiscus, will continue to live their lives.
2	The author chooses to end the story in a very deep, connected way. Itis ended On a note of rebirth and second chances. when Saeng vows,” when the come back, inthe spring, when the snow melts and the geese return, when the Hibiscus is blooming, I will take the test again,&quot; The author is connecting a sense oF a new country and second chances and rebirth. Spring and snow melting could be connected to rebirth, while the geese returning could symbolize a second chance. this is connected to saengs second chance.The author also shows that saeng is getting used to the new country, which shows a sense of hope. Itshows that thereis some hope for her test. 
10	Many families across the globe use computers, whether their from @LOCATION1, all the way to the deserts of @LOCATION2. However, believe that being on a computer can negative effects to you like lack of exercise, In @CAPS21 perspective. I can agree, with there, but I truly believe that computers can have a positive effect on society if used correctly. With computer on @CAPS21 side, I believe there are many positive effects towards computers, such as: there are many things to do, you can from the internet, and it is very entertaining. If you have a computer, I'm sure you can agree with me that there are tons of good things you can do. For example, I know of many online colleges. Ever heard of the commecial, &quot;@CAPS1 in your @CAPS2's?&quot; that is where students can got their @CAPS3.E.D and have a succesful carreer. Not only that, you can get discounts on many items just by shopping online. There are many shopping sites online, such as @ORGANIZATION1. Furthermore, many shops like @CAPS4 @CAPS5 have a catolog online, where you and effenly. Lastly, if you have close relatives or friends that live far away, there are many options today like @CAPS6, (@CAPS7 @CAPS8 @CAPS9). Webcam programs like which you see and talk to each other using a webcam and @CAPS10, where you can find your friends and check how their doing daily. These are all good reasons why computers are sucess in the economy. Some computers are used for entertainment. Online there are many @CAPS16 you can play, like @CAPS11's (@CAPS12 @CAPS13 Online @CAPS14-@CAPS15 @CAPS16) I play many of these, including @CAPS16 such as @CAPS17. I love these @CAPS16 because they are very amusing world. You watch many of your favorite movies watch funny obeses on the internet via @CAPS18. @CAPS18 is a world-wide used source where you can watch or upload videos so the world can see. A @CAPS18 video is &quot;@CAPS19 @CAPS20 @CAPS21 @CAPS22,&quot; a young boy gets bitten by his younger brother. This entertainment system is also a great way to use up time lik if you're bored. I can see how people be to it, but you just need to use it wisely and make a plan to use the computer maybe an hour a day. A computer also has many great sources you can learn from, like an online website that has fun @CAPS16 called @CAPS23. With this, you can play many fun @CAPS16 while learning about interesting facts about science. In @CAPS21 science class, we use this websites many times, to us learn about motion/gravity. You can also conduct research on the web, you with many projects. I know I use the web to with almost every project I have.
0	I think the author concludes the story with this paragraph because he wants us to get the morle of the story. I said this idea because in the story he talks about orchids, lanno bushes, oleanders, elephant ear begonias, and bougainvillea vires surrounded her. It talks about how these flowers surrounded her to test her. Of her @CAPS1.
1	I think the Author concludes this in the story because. It is a key information for this story. Because. It is dealing with her mom. She loves to work on the garden and become a garden and have a really job. Like her mom
1	Saeng thinks that she has failed because she misses her grandmother. The hiscubus plant that she buys reminds her of grandmother’s scent. Saeng spent over @MONEY1 on the hibiscus plant. She needed it to feel a little bit more at home. Saeng feels she had very little time to leave her country, in “a blink.” Her grandmother would want her to be strong and not cry at the thought of being away from her. Saeng needs to think of the good and smile when she is reminded of her past. Saeng wants to pass the test. next time the hibiscus are budding she must not cry.
0	The reason I think that the author did it is because wanted you to know what time it took place and what the weather was like then it also so tells you how long she is going to wait like till the snow melts and that is going to be while and when the geese live and return home so this is why I think she tells you what is like.
0	I think that this is about winter hiliscus and hedpe tall and lush bad surrounded their garden its lush green leaves dotted with vermilion flowers, She said when she got to the hibiscus she reached out and touched a petal gently. 
2	The reason that the author had ended the story the way she did was to leave the reader on the last thought. Also it symbolizes rebirth. When Saeng says, “... this hibiscus is budding ...” (Ho @NUM1). She is also describing that they will start over when spring comes. And that leaves the reader with the last thought about Saeng, and how she has overcome living in the new place. Lastly, it ties up @CAPS1 feelings and experiences the whole time she had moved, “... I will take the test again” (Ho @NUM1), which tells the reader she will continue to give her new home a shot. In conclusion, the reason for this quote being the last paragraph is to show that Saeng will continue to try to overcome ??? (WORDS NOT @CAPS2) 
3	The author concludes story with that paragraph because she wants there to be hope for the future seeing that hibiscus budding in the spring is what Saeng is waiting for. It gives her hope that she will be able to pass that test again. This is showed when she says “.. and this  hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again, ’’@CAPS1 the winter ,Saeng hopes she will improve and when the hibiscus  buds she will know that it is time to try again .Saeng sees the spring as a new beginning. So that means it is a time to overcme her obstade.I think that obstade or test might be to not cry when she thinks about her old life in Vietnam. When she accomplishes this, she is growing just like the hibiscus     
0	The author concludes the story with that paragrap for one main reason.
0	The author is showing that Saeng wants to keep on with her mother's gardening. To take over an elders traditions and what her mother started.
2	I believe that the author ended the story with this paragraph to show the persistence of the main character. I believe this because in the beginning of the story when she is walking home, she states that she failed the drivers test. In the last paragraph, she states that after winter is over she will take the test again when her hibiscus blooms. Her persistence allows her to push through life as if she was a plant trying to survive the winter.
9	Imagine your life without the benifits @ORGANIZATION2 the computer. Do you think it would make life a little harder? Computers have positive effects on people for educational reasons and for a new way to develope @CAPS3 skills. @ORGANIZATION2 is very important to our sociotey. Computers can help with our educational needs. When a school project is going on more than @PERCENT1 @ORGANIZATION2 students use a computer to acces the information they need. I agree that students depend too much on a computer and not on books, but the computer has more information to offer than the average book. The computer @CAPS1 lets us, as students, to broaden our horizon. The @ORGANIZATION2 stated that &quot;a near @PERCENT2 @ORGANIZATION2 students learn something new from a computer that they did not already know.&quot; @CAPS1, in @CAPS2 and @CAPS3 @CAPS4 a student could find more information on a specific country than they could with a book. I predict that as a result @ORGANIZATION2 the informational acces the computer gives us, that soon grades will boost at least @NUM1 to @PERCENT3. In a servey that was done by the @ORGANIZATION1, found that @PERCENT4 @ORGANIZATION2 students found more information, that was relavent, on a selected topic than in the whole school library. Next, the computer can help with hand-eye coordination for young kids. In school students are observed to see how well or if there coordination is being developed. With @PERCENT3 @ORGANIZATION2 students having very little coordination, computer games lowered the @PERCENT3 to @PERCENT5. The computer does help with the educational needs @ORGANIZATION2 students in @LOCATION1. The computer is a great way to socialize with friends. It is a new and inventive way to communicate. I know that some @MONTH1 say that there is less time spent humanly interacting, but on the computer it is still interacting.

1	The author concludes the story with the paragraph because she wants to do it right next time. Whats its saying is that she can try every year to get it right to impress her mother. In conclusion that what I have to say about the paragraph
3	 In the story “Winter Hibiscus” the author @CAPS1  the most likely ends the story with this quote because he wants to show that she thinks of the Hibiscus as more than just a flowers, to Saeng it is also a memory. For Saeng the Winter Hibiscus is like  story books, waiting to be read simply by smelling the flower it unlocks wonderful memories of precious time spent with her “ gentle grandmother” from her first home. @CAPS1  the is trying to use the flower to show the reader how much a simple object can trigger a memory, thought and so on. The last sentence clearly states, with evidence from the story, Saeng cares deeply about her past and so she can fit in with life today she must not forgot who she was. By keeping the hibiscus in her garden she can have a beautiful reminder of whose she  came from. Therefore one is to believe this reasoning is the  assumption as to why @CAPS1 the ended the story “Winter Hibiscus “ with the paragraph selected.
2	The author concludes the story with that paragraph for many reasons. For example, it shows a sense of hope, when she says “this hibiscus is budding&quot;. That indicates a new beginning or starting over. I think that is the idea the author is trying to get across. Obviously it was difficult for the author to adjust to her new country. For example, she was disappointed that the hibiscus wasn’t the same as the one in her homeland. Even though she's feeling hostalgic; this paragraph reassures the reader that the author is willing to give her new country another chance.
2	The author concludes the story with that particular paragraph for a number of reasons. The last paragraph states that “when they come back ... I will take the test again,” (Ho @NUM1). Already upset about failing her driving test, the main character is upset missing her homeland. The buds of the flowers give her hope and essentially, the strength to take the test over again. Also when she was originally in the flower shop, after smelling and seeing the flowers, “A  wave of loss so deep and strong that it stung Saeng’s eyes now swept over her ... And in the warm moist shelter of the greenhouse, Saeng broke down and wept “(Ho @NUM2). It is obvious that to the main character these flowers mean so much to her; they take her back to her home country, which she was abruptly torn from and misses, they give her hope and they remind her of the things she loves, like her grandmother. In conclusion, the author chose to end the story with this paragraph because that is what means the most to the main character. 
1	The author concludes this story with this paragraph to show she loved them flowers. That they met a whole lot to her. When she failed her driven test she was sad. An the flower made her feel better. now that the snow is failing she waits untill spring that when they come up and she will have faith and take the test again.
0	The author concluded this sentence because he was letting everyone know that Saeng would return to the hibiscus and take care of it still, and that she has not forgotten about it.
3	In the story &quot;Winter Hibiscus&quot;, by Minfong Ho, a teenager, Saeng, moves from Vietnam to the United states. She later takes a drivers test, but doesn't not succeed in passing, but does succeed in finding comfort from her memories of her homeland. The last paragraph states &quot;When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.&quot; The author concludes the story with this paragraph for many raesons. These being that Saeng was very upset about failing her test and was reminded of her homeland and the changes she's had to adapt to during this move. The hibiscus plant gives Saeng a hope to continue her jouney even when things get very hard. The winter is this plants time of trouble and sadness, as Saeng's time of trouble and sadness is failing this test and not being at her real home. The end of winter gives both the plant and Saeng a chance to start over and a renewed hope to start over, Saeng will find it easy to get through hardships if she continues to find comfort from her past.
1	The author concludes the story with that paragraph to get the readers wondering. To show that she’s not going to give up on what she wants to do.
2	The author Minfong Ho ends the story talking about the test Saeng failed and vowing to take it again because like in the story the test was symbolizing like slightly moving on, just kind of starting her newlife and not living in the old. But Saeng couldnt do that. She bought the flower with all her money because it held memories for her. But I think as the story goes on she kind of realizes she can have both, her old and new life. I think she ends the story that way because she really does want to try again. She wants to be able to please her mom, and herself she wants to be able to move on and starts her new life.
1	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because saeng  relatestnct  she needs more time. If she takes a break and does what she needs to then she @MONTH1 be able to pass the test.
12	Dear Newspaper, @CAPS1 your life without computers. Writing articles on a typewriter or by hand would surely be a hassle. The question of whether or not computers are beneficial to society has risen in the media, where they argue that people spend less time exercising interacting with nature, and less time with their family. However, computers are a great step forward in modern science and are beneficial to communities. Computers have drastically helped out educationally at school, not to mention the easier way of connecting with friends and family. Also computers have so many different forms of entertainment. Computers are great step forward and are completely beneficial to our society. Firstly, computers have helped academically in our schools and at home. I can't even @CAPS1 the hassle of coming home with thee assignment or writing two essays, only to have to write it by hand! Wanting to get it over with would only cause me to rush, resulting in a bad grade. Also, think of the handwriting factor. Most kids in my school don't have good handwriting, and I am assuming that teachers have a hard time grading something they can't read. With programs such as @ORGANIZATION1 @CAPS2, you are given the option of different fonts, colors, bolding, pictures, symbols, and so on. Another way computers have helped academically is in schools. More and more teachers are using computers to help us learn. Tests are taken on computers, websites to help us research are visited, and other @ORGANIZATION1 program such as powerpoint can be used for a project. Computers help a lot in school, while helping us learn so much more. Computers also help with keeping in touch with friends and family. The days of short letters are replaced with long emails with pictures attached, sent in a matter of seconds whizzing through the internet only to arrive on your friend's screen. People can save money by not having pictures developed but instead having them stored on their computer, ready to print onto boand paper. There adveances in communication through computers that have been made. Things such as cideo chat (vchat) where you can literally see and talk to the other person, or just audio chat where you can talk to the person, have been made. Such easy ways of communication motivate people to speak to family and friends and stay in touch. Computers have made a positive impact on community by havinf simple ways to talk to your loved ones. Computers can alos provide a fun source of entertainment on the web. Websites have been created where you can play games, find people from your past, or maybe just look out funny videos. Anything you type into your toolbar instantly transforms into a page of links websites where you con find details on your topic, or relative things one fun website is that of 'youtube'. This website lets people upload videos. The possibility are endless on the web. Another fun website is '@CAPS3'. This website is where you can 'friend' people you know from the past and interact with them. You can post viedos, write messages and such. As you can see, entertainment is everywhere on the web. The time is now to understand the full benefits of computers. Computers are a benefit to modern day society because they help academically, encourage you to stay in touch with family and friend, and provide entertainment. We should all understand that computers are a huge advance in science, and they are a great help, and also fun! 
1	The conclude the story this way because he can now expand on this story creating a sequel about Saeng’s success. Also be ending the story this way the author is showing now a limit Saeng is and now she will stop at nothing until her test is complete. Saeng is having difficulties adapting to her new lifestyle because the plants and the previous luteries that she had are no longer present. In the story Saeng’s determination is shown when her mother finds out that she spent @NUM1 dollers to have a simular plant. The mother responds by saying their whole garden is worth less than @NUM1 dollers.
3	This sentence concludes the passage, to show how when the hibiscus is budding and a new season starts, Saeng will be a new person and will be able to take the test. In this sentence the cold snow, fleeing geese and planted hibiscus can all represent Saeng and what she is going through. They are either cold, ready to leave or restricted just like Saeng feels. But, when a new season starts, the geese come back, and the hibiscus is no longer restricted in a pot, Saeng will also grow up and be able to take the test. This sentence is put at the end to show how much Saeng can now grow because she has the hibiscus, which is growing with her.
0	The author ends the story with the sentence provided because , she as she was saying that when  you and winter are over there be the time again to get there gardening back to the test with the plant she had planted. 
1	The author has concluded the story with a paragraph about Saeng taking the test again another time. The author concluded the story with this paragraph because Saeng wanted to take the test again when the snow melts, the geese return and the hibiscus is budding. She feels ready when that time comes around. Saeng is trying to say to herself that she needs more time to be ready for this test. When she gets more time to be ready for the test, she will take the test again. I think that is why the author wrote the paragraph as a conclusion.
1	The author concludes the story with this paragraph. Because when the hibiscus started budding it will give her inspiration to try and past the test again. In order to past the test she wanted to feel like she was home, And to have memories of her home to incourage her to try again. Therefore, this is the reason the author concludes the story with the last paragraph.
2	The author concludes the story with a paragraph taking the test again to show that the narrator @MONTH1 be upset about being in a new place but she will keep trying. The narrator gets upset when she knows the hibiscus is not like the one's from her old home. This upsets her because she probably misses things that she was used to before. The author uses that paragraph to show the narrator is strong and won’t give up on making things the way they were but also showing that she'll try to adapt to her new home. The author does this to show that you should keep trying at something that you love. The narrator will keep trying when the geese fly back and the hibiscus is budding. So the author is saying try if you fail and set goals to never give up.
0	I think the author concludes the story with this paragraph for many reasons.
1	I think the author concludes the story with this paragraph because he knows that he meased up on the test and he saying when spring comes back around he will de ready to take the test I know it is spring because he sad when the snow melts.
0	When she moved to america she saw all the beautiful flowers that were out in the spring she saw a blossom that caught her attention it was called hibiscus. She felt it could with it that she went to the florist to see if they had it. Back were she could they grew wild, jittering out from the cracks in ceizors walls the blossom remind her of her grandmother its long gray hair freshly wased
3	In the “passage winter Hibiscus” by monfong Ho, the quote “ when they come back, Saeng vowed silently, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, I will take the test again, it symbolizes @CAPS1 new journey in the new country she lives in. In the test Saeng is having a personal discrepancy, missing her homeland @CAPS2 she states “I – failed the test.” This test meant more to then she just failing. She was a test to her ability to function in her new country and she failed. The “ when they came back…” quote started above can be analyzed deeply as the snow being her obstacles and the hibiscus being herself. When the obstacles melt away and she buds into a new stronger person she will take the test again.
